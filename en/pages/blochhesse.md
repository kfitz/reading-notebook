# Bloch, R. Howard, and Carla Hesse. “Introduction.” *Representations* 42 (Spring 1993): 1-12.


"We live at a threshold moment in the history of libraries and the forms of knowledge they imply -- a moment comparable to that of early antiquity when the clay tablets of the pre-Christian era were replaced by papyrus rolls; or when these rolls gave way, in the fourth century A.D., to parchment leaves bound in codex; comparable, finally, to the transformation of the great monastic libraries of the Middle Ages, where manuscripts were chained to desks, into the Renaissance humanist libraries in which the numerous books made available by printing came to be stacked along the walls, configuring the library as we know it. One cannot but see significant links between new technologies of information, the most diverse cultural forms, and the deepest social structures caused by such large transformations in the techniques of both writing and of storing and making writing available. The library, as a place for the definition and the preservation of cultural and scientific memory, has always had as much to do with the construction of the present and future as with the past." (Bloch and Hesse 1)

"an editorial decision: that _Representations_ would not simply re-present the debate over the Bibliothèque de France, but would treat the controversy that the project has elicited as itself a symptom of the passions summoned by the library -- as a repository and dispensary of knowledge -- in an age in which real power is increasingly associated with information." (Bloch and Hesse 2)

"alongside the speculation of those who have for some time now been thinking about the history and the future of the book, the nature of literary and scientific property, the future shape of libraries, and the shaping effect of libraries on the wider world. It is our intent, then, less to rekindle the ardor of a debate, with which practically all within the human sciences are by now familiar, than to place its very fury within some significant historical and social perspective, to burrow beneath its terms in order to identify and to contextualize its stakes and motivations." (Bloch and Hesse 2)

"Yet, if the future of the material book appears increasingly uncertain in the face of new media, its image symbolically hovers in and around the architecture of the future library. Thus architect Cathy Simon describes her conception of the main hall of the new San Francisco Main Library building as a kinetic 'table of contents of a book, in which chapter headings lay out the order or structure of the work to follow and give a sense of the complexity contained within.' In this scenario the electronic library is a book come to life, which readers can enter, inhabit, and move about in freely." (Bloch and Hesse 3, quoting Simon)

"Both Nunberg and Roger Chartier endow the anxiety surrounding the book with a physical, and even a corporeal, dimension. The threatened loss of the book -- these 'implausible objects of desire,' these volumes that will in the electronic revolution be detached from their texts, that will in the future be less fetishized than digitized -- cannot be detached from a fear of loss of bodily integrity." (Bloch and Hesse 4, quoting Nunberg)

"The electronic book and the electronic library are seen to be permeable in ways that are analogous to the physical permeability of the individual body. The visual display screen on which books will be read in the future is viewed as a threat to the book as a distinct object. The VDS or reader's 'interface,' as it is delicately phrased by those in the electronic book trade, is the great leveler of discourses. Genres until now considered to be discrete suddenly will mingle indiscreetly on the screen; any text will be able to mate electronically with any other text in what looms as the specter of a great miscegenation of types brought about by digitalization, and whose ultimate fantasy is the evaporation of boundaries, the decomposition of a textual corpus that carries the charge of physical decomposition as well." (Bloch and Hesse 4)

"Jane Ginsburg too reminds us that such a 'multiplication of user copies' necessarily takes us beyond the bounds of the current copyright law as well as beyond existing notions of free copying and fair use to a place where even technical definitions governing books as property, definitions with a long past, must suddenly be rethought in ways which, until the advent of the photocopy machine, were taken for granted -- and in ways which, in light of the electronic revolution, have become the object of intense legal speculation. Thus, where the future of books and the library is concerned, even the law is in some deep sense out of control." (Bloch and Hesse 5)

"Those who focus upon the uncontrollable aspects of print culture replicating and mutating wildly via the electronic revolution also seek to reassure us that the endpoint of such an evolution is less chaos than new forms for the dissemination of knowledge that are as yet simply unforeseeable." (Bloch and Hesse 5)

"Things have been out of control for a long time, only we haven't realized it until now; and if the potential loss of the book is linked psychologically to the fear of loss of bodily wholeness, self-possession, and control, the builders of the future library remind us of the ways in which technology also enables control over that which we have already lost." (Bloch and Hesse 5)

"The electronic library will thus make it possible for readers to respond to the dizzying boundlessness of knowledge itself. In the face of the apparently endless proliferation and fragmentation of new and ever more specialized forms of knowledge, Chartier, Grunberg, and Giffard believe that the electronic library may make it possible to recover the Enlightenment dream of a library that offers not only comprehensive or universal access to knowledge but also the power to move freely within its perimeters. It will become possible for readers to integrate older and newer bodies of knowledge into ever-changing synthetic forms." (Bloch and Hesse 6)

"for some, this conception of the library as an ever-expanding web of intellectual freeplay is, again, the source of profound anxiety, rooted in the fear of losing a cherished liberal conception of cultural authority: the self-contained individually authored text, whose author can be held accountable to a reading public." (Bloch and Hesse 7)

"The aura of anxiety surrounding the library of the future is, of course, intensified by the fact that new technologies for organizing the activity of electronic reading have not yet been fully socialized. The authority with which the electronic archive invests individual readers along with the new possibilities it offers of publication independent of print, such as the electronic bulletin board or the scientific network, signals a return to the culture of the pamphlet, which, as Nunberg observes, 'hasn't played an important role in English-language public discourse since the time of Shelley,' and, as the vehicle of an uncontrollably powerful political voice, has never regained the significance it had in pre-Revolutionary France." (Bloch and Hesse 7)

"The potential loss of the object book, the disappearance of the author and reader as coherent imagined selves constituted through the stabilizing form of the bound book, the disordering of authorial agency in favor of an increasingly active reader (or alternatively, the empowerment of the 'online' author in control of the uses and distribution of texts), the displacement of a hermeneutical model of reading by one premised on absorption, the transformation of copyright into contract: all point toward the subsuming fear of a loss of community, something expressed in different ways in almost every article contained in the present volume." (Bloch and Hesse 8)

"The French situation too is particular, and, again, the creators of the Bibliotheque de France remind us that the loss of one community entails the creation of another. Rather, the electronic library is the potential site of a commingling of communities -- scholarly and popular -- which in France, unlike the United States, have historically lived quite apart." (Bloch and Hesse 9)

"Indeed, the distinction between the professional researcher and the amateur reader is no longer conceived in hierarchical terms, but becomes in the library of the future less a question of social distinction than of different reading practices, distinguished temporally rather than spatially, as 'long- and short-term researchers,' rather than 'scholarly and popular' reading publics." (Bloch and Hesse 9-10)

"Thus, if the electronic book poses the specter of a loss of bodily wholeness, the electronic library holds the promise of restoring a fuller body politic, along with something for all the senses: the intellect of the reader, the eyes of the viewer, the ears of the listener, and the fingertips that touch the keyboards and screens of a multimedia environment." (Bloch and Hesse 10)

"What we are witnessing in the remaking of the library at the end of the twentieth century is not so much a technological revolution (which has already occurred) but the public reinvention of intellectual community in its wake." (Bloch and Hesse 10)

"Gone are the social (learned and popular), political (public and private), or economic (fee-paying versus non-fee-paying) categories that once described the constituencies of old spatial libraries. The imagined writer-reader of the future library is recast in terms of a mode of action in time. The crucial distinction in the world of electronic readers will be, as the builders of the library of the future insist, between the long- and the short-term researcher." (Bloch and Hesse 11)
