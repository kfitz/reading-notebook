1.  Introduction:  The Book is Dead, Long Live the Book!

“If you survey all the print, both tangible and online, that has been dedicated to interactive narratives, however, both enthusiast and Luddite camps share two features in common.  Only a handful of critics on either side have read more than one or two examples of works in the new medium.  Fewer still appear to have performed what could pass for a close reading on even a single interactive narrative before arriving at pronouncements about the medium’s value and future potential....  And, for all the critical hand-waving and hand-wringing about interactive narratives being reader-centered, fewer than a dozen articles have ever deigned to give the experiences of reading them so much as a cursory glance.” (Douglas 2-3)

varying definitions of interactivity (Aarseth v. Murray)

“hypertext fiction” v. “digital narratives”:  hypertext is still produced by authors much as print literature; digital narratives are more akin to film

comparisons between avant-garde print and hypertext fictions; focus on “aesthetic, cognitive, and physical aspects of reading actual hypertext narratives” (Douglas 9)

2.  Books without Pages – Novels without Endings

“One of the purposes driving interactive narratives, however, is the desire for the inexhaustible story, the mystery that unspools with a fresh cast of suspects instead of gliding quickly through its denouement to a limited conclusion; the endless fount of stories that spring from Scheherazade during her 1,001 nights; the seemingly limitless versions of long-familiar tales that Homeric rhapsodes spun in response to cues and demands from their audiences.” (Douglas 13)

“There is, of course, a perfectly sound reason why the kaleidoscopic book has never been attempted:  part of the concept of the book is bound up in its fixity, the changelessness of its text.” (Douglas 14); if you could change the book, “how would you decide you were finished reading?  And how would you know you were finished with the story for good, especially since your future readings could potentially trigger new twists and fresh narrative possibilities?” (Douglas 14)

“In the entertainment industry, killer technologies generally make only equipment obsolete:  the compact disk destroyed the market for turntables and vinyl alike but did not alter so much as a single musical genre.  The issue here is not whether the book and interactive narrative can exist comfortably together, so much as whether future readers will begin reading print works differently from the way they do now.” (Douglas 15)

“This difference between interactive and print narratives can make comparing accounts of what each reader thought the story was ‘about’ in a literature seminar infinitely more varied and problematic for interactive than for print texts, since the events in the story itself, as well as its interpretation, may differ between students’ experiences of the text.” (Douglas 17)

“You do not need to be particularly perceptive to see the possibility of producing sequential yet nonlinear discourse with hypertext as an illustration of Jacques Derrida’s contrast between linear and nonlinear writing.  Nor do you need to be fantastically well versed in the writings of Roland Barthes to recognize hypertext in his description in ‘From Work to Text’ of print text as a network of references to and reflections of other works...” (Douglas 18)

shifting notions of the nature of reading: Sartre; Wolfgang Iser’s The Act of Reading

“Reading, interpreting, seems to be something we do almost in spite of ourselves.  In fact, our contemporary use of the word read as a synonym for interpret (as in ‘Yeah, that’s how I read his character, too’) is rather telling:  to read is to interpret.” (Douglas 30)

reading hypertext has more in common with dancing than with reading novels — “Until a reader assembles it, performing it, the text exists only as a set of potential motions, a sequence of steps and maneuvers that become actualized only at the instant that the reader selects a segment of text or fulfills a condition for movement.” (Douglas 31)

“Both my perception and my behavior are more or less directed by my knowledge of what are called, variously, depending on whether you are a cognitive scientist or an art historian, scripts or schemata.... When we read, schemata incline us toward forming hypotheses that lead to our making some inferences and excluding others without our ever being aware of the existence of latent, alternative interpretations.” (Douglas 32)

“reading hypertext fiction reminds us of just how complex the act of reading is, a condition to which a lifetime of immersion in a highly conventionalized, print-saturated environment has made us virtually immune.  This is due, partly, to the absence of any established or even apparent conventions that guide the writers and readers who work with hypertext narratives.” (Douglas 35)

3.  What Interactive Narratives Do That Print Narratives Cannot

“The dilemma in most short, succinct definitions of hypertext lies in the definition of the word sequence.  As used in the definitions above, sequence and sequential denote a singular, fixed, continuous, and authoritative order of reading and writing.  But sequence can also mean ‘a following of one thing after another; succession; arrangement; a related or continuous series’... All interactive narratives have sequences — some of them more disorienting that others, granted — making the medium, if anything, polysequential.” (Douglas 37-38)

defining hypertext fiction all but impossible this early in the form’s history; better to approach a definition by thinking about what hypertext can do that print cannot

“Interactive narratives have no singular, definitive beginnings and endings” (Douglas 39)

“Readers of interactive narratives can proceed only on the basis of choices they make” (Douglas 42)

characteristics of “true” interactivity:  interruptibility; fine granularity; graceful degradation; limited look-ahead; absence of a single, clear-cut default path or action; the impression of an infinite database (Douglas 43)

“Interactive narrative segments exist in a network of interconnections mapped in virtual, three-dimensional space” (Douglas 50)

“Interactive narratives have many orders in which they can be read coherently” (Douglas 52)

“The language in interactive narratives appears less determinate than the language present in print pages” (Douglas 54)

print precursors:  “narratives of multiplicity” and “mosaic narratives”

“so interactive narratives do not have singular or definite beginnings or endings, and readers can proceed through them only by making choices about what they have read or what they would like to read... but how on earth do you know when the story is over?  How do you know when it is finished, when you are finished?” (Douglas 62)

4.  Charting Maps and Raising the Dead:  Readers’ Encounters with Hypertext Fiction

“Narratives, in a sense, are about connectedness, sequence, order — qualities that are inextricably linked to the way we view the world around us.  We might even say that narratives represent a reflection of our tendency to perceive the world in terms of intentional or causal states, albeit a reflection that produces an orderly, predictable, and complete world within a static structure.  But if this mode of perception is part of what makes narratives so attractive to us and, apparently, so important a component of our lives, it is also integral to our being able to read, interpret, and understand narratives at all.” (Douglas 64)

importance of the link to hypertext

also importance of the fragment:  “Once you cut a text into fragments, you can liberate all the subversive, alternative connections possible between segments.” (Douglas 67)

“When you reach the end of Middlemarch or The 400 Blows, although you can dicker over whether the ending was satisfactory or a disappointment, you cannot define closure as an abstract entity:  it is an integral part of any published poem or piece of fiction.  When you reach the ‘end’ of ‘Forking Paths,’ or afternoon or any other piece of hypertext fiction, closure becomes an entity that needs a lot of defining.” (Douglas 82-83)

5.  Just Tell Me When to Stop:  Hypertext and the Displacement of Closure

“Part of the pleasure of reading is tied up with an ending...  Or perhaps closure is more than simply a mere component in our pleasure, perhaps it is integral to narrative aesthetics and poetics, as critics like Peter Brooks and Frank Kermode have persuasively argued.” (Douglas 89)

“Our sense of arriving at closure is satisfied when we manage to resolve narrative tensions and to minimize ambiguities, to explain puzzles, and to incorporate as many of the narrative elements as possible into a coherent pattern — preferably one for which we have a schema gleaned from either life experience or from encounters with other narratives.  Unlike most print narratives, however, hypertext fiction invites us to return to it again and again, its openness and indeterminacy making our sense of closure simply one ‘ending’ among many possible.” (Douglas 122)

6.  The Intentional Network

“reading a narrative in a nearly random order can considerably narrow the distinction between fiction and life.  Whereas fiction pleases us with its consonances, its patterns and gestalts, its symmetry and predictability, life can be chaotic and unpredictable, all sense of orderliness or patter possible only at the distance conferred by retrospection after the passage of years.  To encounter fiction outside any established order is to enjoy a dubious bit of freedom, less like an aesthetic experience and more like dicing with life itself.” (Douglas 126)

“On the other hand, hypertext fiction, we should never forget, is digital.  There are always at least two other texts lurking beneath whatever we read, both of them like palimpsests, medieval parchment painted over for reuse where the topmost text was superimposed on whatever had existed beneath it.  Like a palimpsest, most of those other texts are secret, hidden, even invisible.  Most of us never glimpse the code that enables hypertext software to run — an environment that itself already determines how authoritarian, how automatous [sic] the fiction may seem to its readers — just as few of us can do more than guess at the scripts hypertext authors generate in the creation of a network that will act as choreographer to its readers’ realizations of the text.” (Douglas 130)

the return of intentionality in hypertext

“Hypertext has, ineluctably, inherited a number of print conventions that have trailed into the medium on the lengthy coattails of print literature.  The difficulty — and what makes the intentional network so obtrusive at the moment — is that literary conventions have, not surprisingly, been hurled willy-nilly into the breach, used tactically where we are accustomed to dealing with them strategically in print.” (Douglas 135)

“More often than not, hypertext narratives defy rather than correspond to our expectations, staking out our trails through the text not with helpful break crumbs or bowed branches but with dense thickets of puns and allusions, jokes and rapid reversals of expectation.” (Douglas 136-37)

“Where, you are doubtless tempted to ask, is the radical reconfiguring of author and reader that hypertext has ostensibly promised since the days when the technology was little more than Vannevar Bush’s sketches of microfilm and illuminated desktops?  Where is the genre that promises, as I suggested in chapter 2, to alter the way we think about books as intellectual property, to blur the lines between author and reader?  We need look no further than the same medium that has given us the intentional network.  Like any hybrid, hypertext has some of the characteristics of one parent, print, and some of the other, digital technology.  If, at the moment, its phenotype seems to have more of the look of print than it does of digital flexibility, we can put it down to our peering so closely at something barely in its infancy.” (Douglas 140-41)

why do we want anything to be interactive?

“Technologies with vastly different capacities enable us to do radically different things with them.  Yet, as we have seen, hypertext is no inherently democratic or liberating or egalitarian any more than it is implicitly more limiting, more authoritarian than print.” (Douglas 147)

7.  Millennium Stories:  Interactive Narratives and the New Realism

narrative schemata:  macroplots v. microplots; plot twists and complications

“Contrary to the convictions of Sven Birkerts and other Luddity critics, technology and interactivity nudge up no closer to the extinction of le mot juste than we were before the invention of the telegraph, telephone, television, or computers.  Beneath every interactive narrative, adventure, mystery, thriller, or romance lie words, the scripts that can render characters lifelike and memorable, the scenes and details that we recall long after we have forgotten the way the thing ends.  While it is possible to make a terrible film from an excellent script, it is virtually impossible to turn a hackneyed script into a watchable film, just as all the whizzy animation and three-dimenional modeling in the world cannot salvage a poorly scripted interactive narrative consisting mostly of swordplay or where the outcome to the narrative is inevitably the same, no matter what paths you take or choices you make as you work through it.” (Douglas 171)

“scripted orality” (Douglas 172)
