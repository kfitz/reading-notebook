Montfort, Nick, and Noah Wardrip-Fruin. Acid-Free Bits: Recommendations for Long-Lasting Electronic Literature. Electronic Literature Organization, 2004. <http://eliterature.org/pad/afb.html>


Preface by Joseph Tabbi: Acid-Free Bits and the ELO PAD Project

"a plea for writers to work proactively in archiving their own creations, and to bear these issues in mind even in the act of composition." (Tabbi)

"Contrary to expectations, the electronic archive has not been conducive to the creation and circulation of literary writing. Writers of electronic literature have needed, to a degree unimaginable in print, essentially to build the environment for their own work. Those who neglect basic preservation issues very quickly discover the mess that technological obsolescence makes, not only of individual works, but of the connections among texts, images, and code-work that are crucial for any sustained, community-wide literary practice." (Tabbi)

"the Web edition of Acid-Free Bits is itself a model of standards and best practices circa summer 2004, created in a non-proprietary, open, XML-based language that facilitates the kind of cross-referencing, mixing, and institutional networking that the Organization as a whole, working collectively, hopes to produce in the coming months and years." (Tabbi)


1. Keeping E-Lit Alive

"Electronic literature doesn't come on bound, offset-printed pages. Keeping it on a shelf doesn't mean that it will be easy, or even possible, to read it in the future. Even putting it into a vault with controlled temperature, light, and humidity won't ensure its availability." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)

"For electronic literature to be readable, its mechanisms must continue to operate or must be replaced, since changes in the context of computing will complicate access to important works of literature on the computer. The context of computing includes operating systems, applications, the network environment, and interface hardware -- and this context is constantly evolving." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)

"Preservation is always the work of a community. Ultimately, preserving electronic literature will be the work of a system of writers, publishers, electronic literature scholars, librarians, archivists, software developers, and computer scientists. But today, and even once such a system is in place, the practices of authors and publishers will determine whether preserving particular works is relatively easy or nearly impossible." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)


2. Acid-Free Bits

"this is an outline of some important principles that, when used to guide literary practice on the computer, can make it easier for e-lit to remain accessible, functional, and enjoyable for future readers." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)


3. How Electronic Literature Is Preserved

3.1 Old Hardware Is Preserved to Run Old Systems -- but this is costly and difficult, as well as site-specific

3.2 Old Programs Are Emulated or Interpreted on New Hardware -- "As long as some strong interest in work from certain older platforms remains, it is likely that emulation or interpretation of them will be an option -- new emulators and interpreters will continue to be developed for new platforms." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)

3.3 Old Programs and Media Are Migrated to New Systems -- "the results are of varying fidelity. In addition, the conversion may have to be done several times (from the original format to a 1998 format, from a 1998 format to today's platform, and again in the future) and each migration risks introducing new problems." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)

3.4 Systems Are Documented Along with Instructions for Recreating Them -- "Although this option does not preserve people's ability to interact with an e-lit work as they did originally, it often provides a practical way for people to get an idea of what an e-lit work was like." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)


4.  Principles for Creating Long-Lasting Work

4.1 Prefer Open Systems to Closed Systems -- "Those who use open systems and adhere to open standards when creating electronic literature have a much better chance that the format of their literary works will be supported, or decipherable, in the future." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)

4.2 Prefer Community-Directed Systems to Corporate-Driven Systems -- "there are specific risks to the longevity of corporate technologies that aren't present in free and academic systems." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)

4.3 Consolidate Code, Supply Comments

4.4 Validate Code -- "Validating a page or site, using a service like the W3C Validator or the validator built into BBEdit, ensures that all browsers that comply with World Wide Web Consortium standards, now and in the future, will deal with the page correctly." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)

4.5 Prefer Plain-Text Formats to Binary Formats -- "A plain-text format, such as HTML (or such as XML formats like XHTML or SVG), can be edited, read, and inspected on many platforms. This accessibility remains even if the program that created it, or the program that was meant to interpret it, is no longer available (or exists in a radically different and incompatible version)." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)

4.6 Prefer Cross-Platform Options to Single-System Options

4.7 Keep the Whole System in Mind -- "Preserving the work means preserving the entire system that enables it to run. Providing alternative means for the system to operate can increase the possibilities for future readers." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)

4.8 Document Early, Document Often

4.9 Retain Source Files -- "though their file sizes are usually significantly larger than those of delivery files, authors are encouraged to retain source and project files for the components of their e-lit. Ideally, these should be archived and copied with the work itself and should be well-organized and appropriately labeled. Providing copies to publishers can guard against the accidental loss of source files. The possibility of making a small change to source code, or of exporting images in a different format, may make ongoing accessibility much easier to achieve." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)

4.10 Use Common Tools and Documented Capabilities -- "The use of more obscure tools places an additional burden on authors, however: in order to develop or modify their work, they have to keep a version of this software running as the technological environment shifts. This can require that authors act as preservationists to maintain access to their own development tools."; "platform developers are unlikely to retain undocumented capabilities in future versions, and emulated hardware is much less likely to support undocumented features of previous systems." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)

4.11 Maintain Metadata and Bibliographic Information -- "Those who use formats (such as HTML, XML, or most programming languages) that allow such information to be included in comments can keep such metadata in plain text within the e-lit files themselves, making it less likely that it will be inadvertently separated from the work." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)

4.12 Allow and Encourage Duplication and Republication

4.13 Keep Copies on Different, Durable Media -- "back up essential files in multiple ways. When backing up to tape, authors can also copy files to another computer's hard drive, burn them on CD-Rs, and transfer at least some of the most important files onto a network system for which someone else maintains backups (such as a university network)." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)


5.  Looking Ahead

"an initiative of the ELO's PAD project called X-Lit. The X-Lit initiative involves developing a rich representation for electronic literature that is in keeping with the principles described here, one that will be human-readable and machine-playable long into the future. X-Lit will allow the representation of media elements (including text, graphics, sound, and video) as well as a description of the interactive and computational workings of an e-lit piece. The standard will also provide a way to document the physical setup and material aspects of an e-lit work. X-Lit will be an application of the open standard XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and itself will be open and community-directed." (Montfort and Wardrip-Fruin)
