Preface (Ernesto Laclau, ix-xv)

"In Anglo-Saxon countries this centrality of the clinical aspect has, to a large extent, been absent and the influence of Lacan has revolved almost exclusively around the literature-cinema-feminism triangle." (Laclau ix)

"different Lacanian 'generations'.  On the one hand, we find the approach of the 'old school' or first generation of Lacanians... who emphasize clinical problems and the crucial role of the *Symbolic* in the psychoanalytical process.  This approach is largely based on Lacan's writing in the 1950s, the era of high structuralism, in which the Imaginary register is presented as a series of variants that must be referred to a stable symbolic matrix.  On the other hand, the younger generation... has attempted to formalize Lacanian theory, pointing out the distinctions between the different stages of his teaching, and placing an accent on the theoretical importance of the last stage, in which a central role is granted to the notion of the *Real* as that which resists symbolization.  As regards the attempts to articulate Lacanian theory with other theoretical approaches, it is worth mentioning in the first instance the hermeneutical appropriation of Lacan that has taken place, principally in German... This consists mainly in an attempt to show that the hermeneutical 'horizon of prejudices' can offer the proper philosophical foundation to psychoanalysis.  To this one should add the Marxist-structuralist interpretation of Lacan carried out by Althusser and his followers... In this reading, Lacanian psychoanalysis is presented as the only psychological theory which contains a notion of the subject that is compatible with historical materialism." (Laclau x)

on Zizek and the Slovenian Lacanian school:  "In contrast with the Latin and Anglo-Saxon world, Lacanian categories have been used in a reflection which is essentially *philosophical* and *political*.  And while the Slovenian theoreticians make some effort to extend their analysis to the domain of literature and film, the clinical dimension is totally absent.  Two main features characterize this school.  The first is its insistent reference to the ideological-political field... The second distinctive feature of the Slovenian school is the use of Lacanian categories in the analysis of classical philosophical texts... The specific 'flavour' of the Slovenian theorists is given by their Hegelian orientation: they attempt to articulate a new reading of Hegel's philosophy which leaves behind such long-established assumptions as Hegel's presumed pan-logicism or the notion that the systematic character of his reflection leads to the abolition of all differences in the final mediation by Reason." (Laclau x-xi)

"The basic thesis of the book -- that the category of 'subject' cannot be reduced to the 'positions of the subject', since before subjectivation the subject is the subject of a lack -- is formulated in the first chapter: each of the subsequent chapters which reiterate this thesis does so in a new discursive context which sheds light on it from a different angle." (Laclau xii)

"This book also contains an implicit invitation to break the barrier separating theoretical languages from those of everyday life." (Laclau xiii)

"two key points in the text, given their productiveness in terms of political analysis.  The first refers to the use which is made of Saul Kripke's anti-descriptivism in political analysis.  The dispute between descriptivists and anti-descriptivists revolves around the question of the way in which names refer to objects.  According to the descriptivists, the link is the result of the *meaning* of a name -- that is to say, each name involves a cluster of descriptive features and refers to those objects in the real world displaying those features.  For the anti-descriptivists, on the other hand, the name refers to the object by means of what they call a 'primal baptism' in which the name continues to refer to the *object* even if all the descriptive features of the object at the time of its baptism have disappeared.  Like myself, Zizek sides with the anti-descriptivists.  But he also introduces a variant into the argument which is of crucial importance.  The central problem for any anti-descriptivist approach is to determine what it is in the object, beyond its descriptive features, that constitutes its identity -- that is to say, what it is that constitutes the objective correlative of the 'rigid designator'.  On this point, Zizek presents the following argument:  'What is overlooked, at least in the standard version of anti-descriptivism, is that this guaranteeing the identity of an object in all counterfactual situations, that is, through a change of all its descriptive features, is the *retroactive effect of naming itself*: it is the name itself, the signifier, which supports the identity of the object...' Now this argument is crucial.  For if the unity of the object is the retroactive effect of naming itself, then naming is not just the pure nominalistic game of attributing an empty name to a preconstituted subject.  It is the discursive construction of the object itself." (Laclau xiii-xiv)

"The essentially performative character of naming is the precondition for all hegemony and politics." (Laclau xiv)

"The traditional debate as to the relationship between agent and structure thus appears fundamentally displaced: the issue is no longer a problem of *autonomy*, of determinism versus free will, in which two entities fully constituted as 'objectivities' mutually limit each other.  On the contrary, the subject emerges as a result of the failure of substance in the process of its self-constitution." (Laclau xv)


Introduction

"our first thesis would be that the great debate occupying the foreground of today's intellectual scene, the Habermas-Foucault debate, is masking another opposition, another debate which is theoretically more far-reaching: the Althusser-Lacan debate." (Zizek 1)

"With Habermas, we have the ethics of the unbroken communication, the Ideal of the universal, transparent intersubjective community; the notion of the subject behind this is, of course, the philosophy-of-language version of the old subject of transcendental reflection.  With Foucault, we have a turn against that universalist ethics which results in a kind of aestheticization of ethics: each subject must, without any support from universal rules, build his own mode of self-mastery; he must harmonize the antagonism of the powers within himself -- invent himself, so to speak, produce himself as subject, find his own particular art of living.... Foucault's notion of the subject is, rather, a classical one: subject as the power the self-mediation and harmonizing the antagonistic forces, as a way of mastering the 'use of pleasures' through a restoration of the image of self.  Here Habermas and Foucault are the two sides of the same coin -- the real break is represented by Althusser, by his insistence on the fact that a certain cleft, a certain fissure, misrecognition, characterizes the human condition as such: by the thesis that the idea of the possible end of ideology is an ideological idea *par excellence*" (Zizek 2)

"The point is not just that we must unmask the structural mechanism which is producing the effect of subject as ideological misrecognition, but that we must at the same time fully acknowledge this misrecognition as unavoidable -- that is, we must accept a certain delusion as a condition of our historical activity, of assuming a role as agent of the historical process.
     In this perspective, the subject as such is constituted through a certain misrecognition: the process of ideological interpellation through which the subject 'recognizes' itself as the addressee in the calling up of the ideological cause implies necessarily a certain short circuit, an illusion of the type 'I was already there'" (Zizek 2-3)

"In contrast to this Althusserian ethics of *alienation* in the symbolic 'process without subject', we may denote the ethics implied by Lacanian psychoanalysis as that of *separation*.  The famous Lacanian motto not to give way to one's desire [*ne pas céder sur son desir*] -- is aimed at the fact that we must not obliterate the distance separating the Real from its symbolization: it is this surplus of the Real over every symbolization that functions as the object-cause of desire." (Zizek 3)

"It is upon the unity of these two features that the Marxist notion of the revolution, of the revolutionary situation, is founded: a situation of metaphorical condensation in which it finally becomes clear to the everyday consciousness that it is not possible to solve any particular question without solving them all -- that is, without solving the fundamental question which embodies the antagonistic character of the social totality." (Zizek 3)

"Marxists are using all their skill and adroitness of argument to convince the participants in these particular struggles that the only real solution to their problem is to be found in the global revolution: as long as social relations are dominated by Capital, there will always be sexism in relations between the sexes, there will always be a threat of global war, there will always be a danger that political and social freedoms will be suspended, nature itself will always remain an object of ruthless exploitation.... The global revolution will then abolish the basic social antagonism, enabling the formation of a transparent, rationally governed society.
     The basic feature of 'post-Marxism' is, of course, the break with this logic -- which, incidentally, does not necessarily have a Marxist connotation: almost any of the antagonisms which, in the light of Marxism, appear to be secondary can take over this essential role of mediator for all the others." (Zizek 4, ellipsis in original)

"Psychoanalytic 'essentialism' is paradoxical in so far as it is precisely psychoanalysis -- at least in its Lacanian reading -- which presents the real break with essentialist logic.  That is to say, Lacanian psychoanalysis goes a decisive step further than the usual 'post-Marxist' anti-essentialism affirming the irreducible plurality of particular struggles -- in other words, demonstrating how their articulation into a series of equivalences depends always on the radical contingency of the social-historical process: it enables us to grasp this plurality itself as a multitude of responses to the same impossible-real kernel." (Zizek 4)

"In this perspective, the 'death drive', this dimension of radical negativity, cannot be reduced to an expression of alienated social conditions, it defines *la condition humaine* as such: there is not solution, no escape from it; the thing to do is not to 'overcome', to 'abolish' it, but to come to terms with it, to learn to recognize it in its terrifying dimension and then, on the basis of this fundamental recognition, to try to articulate a *modus vivendi* with it.
     All 'culture' is in this way a reaction-formation, an attempt to limit, canalize -- to *cultivate* this imbalance, this traumatic kernel, this radical antagonism through which man cuts his umbilical cord with nature, with animal homeostasis.  It is not only that the aim is no longer to abolish this drive antagonism, but the aspiration to abolish it is precisely the source of totalitarian temptation: the greatest mass murders and holocausts have always been perpetrated in the name of man as harmonious being, of a New Man without antagonistic tension." (Zizek 5)

"We have the same logic with democracy: it is -- to use the worn-out phrase attributed to Churchill -- the worst of all possible systems; the only problem is that there is no other which would be better.  That is to say, democracy always entails the possibility of corruption, of the rule of dull mediocrity; the only problem is that every attempt to elude this inherent risk and to restore 'real' democracy necessarily brings about its opposite -- it ends in the abolition of democracy itself." (Zizek 5)

on Laclau and Mouffe, _Hegemony and Socialist Strategy_: "They emphasize that we must not be 'radical' in the sense of aiming at a radical solution: we always live in an interspace and in borrowed time; every solution is provisional and temporary, a kind of postponing of a fundamental impossibility.  Their term 'radical democracy' is thus to be taken somehow paradoxically: it is precisely *not* 'radical' in the sense of pure, true democracy; its radical character implies, on the contrary, that we can save democracy only by *taking into account its own radical impossibility*." (Zizek 6)

"My thesis... is that the most consistent model of such an acknowledgement of antagonism is offered by Hegelian dialectics: far from being a story of its progressive overcoming, dialectics is for Hegel a systematic notation of the failure of all such attempts -- 'absolute knowledge' denotes a subjective position which finally accepts 'contradiction' as an internal condition of every identity.  In other words, Hegelian 'reconciliation' is not a 'panlogicist' sublation of all reality in the Concept but a final consent to the fact that the concept itself is 'not-all'" (Zizek 6)

"the only way to 'save Hegel' is through Lacan, and this Lacanian reading of Hegelian heritage opens up a new approach to ideology, allowing us to grasp contemporary ideological phenomena (cynicism, 'totalitarianism', the fragile status of democracy) without falling prey to any kind of 'postmodernist' traps (such as the illusion that we live in a 'post-ideological' condition)." (Zizek 7)


Part I: The Symptom

1.  How Did Marx Invent the Symptom?

-- Marx, Freud: the Analysis of Form

"there is a fundamental homology between the interpretative procedure of Marx and Freud -- more precisely, between their analysis of commodity and of dreams.  In both cases the point is to avoid the properly fetishistic fascination of the 'content' supposedly hidden behind the form: the 'secret' to be unveiled through analysis is not the content hidden by the form (the form of commodities, the form of dreams) but, on the contrary, *the 'secret' of this form itself*." (Zizek 11)

"Herein, then, lies the basic misunderstanding: if we seek the 'secret of the dream' in the latent content hidden by the manifest text, we are doomed to disappointment: all we find is some entirely 'normal' -- albeit usually unpleasant -- thought, the nature of which is mostly non-sexual and definitely not 'unconscious'.  This 'normal', conscious/preconscious thought is not drawn towards the unconscious, repressed simply because of its 'disagreeable' character for the conscious, but because it achieves a kind of 'short circuit' between it and another desire which is already repressed, located in the unconscious, *a desire which has nothing whatsoever to do with the 'latent dream-thought'*.  'A normal train of thought' -- normal and therefore one which can be articulated in common, everyday language: that is, in the syntax of the 'secondary process' -- 'is only submitted to the abnormal psychical treatment of the sort we have been describing' -- to the dream-work, to the mechanisms of the 'primary process' -- 'if an unconscious wish, derived from infancy and in a state of repression, has been transferred on to it'" (Zizek 12-13, quoting Freud, _The Interpretation of Dreams_)

"This desire attaches itself to the dream, it intercalates itself in the interspace between the latent thought and the manifest text; it is therefore not 'more concealed, deeper' in relation to the latent thought, it is decidedly more 'on the surface', consisting entirely of the signifier's mechanisms, of the treatment to which the latent thought is submitted.  In other words, its only place is in the *form* of the 'dream': the real subject matter of the dream (the unconscious desire) articulates itself in the dream-work, in the elaboration of its 'latent content'." (Zizek 13)

"This, then, is the basic paradox of the dream: the unconscious desire, that which is supposedly its most hidden kernel, articulates itself precisely through the dissimulation work of the 'kernel' of a dream, its latent thought, through the work of disguising this content-kernel by means of its translation into the dream-rebus." (Zizek 13)

Freud's "two stages": first, move toward a hermeneutical approach to dream-interpretation, understanding the dream as meaningful; then, get rid of obsession with the 'kernel' of meaning in the dream, and instead focus on the dream-work; "The crucial thing to note here is that we find exactly the same articulation in two stages with Marx, in his analysis of the 'secret of the commodity form'" (Zizek 14): first, understand the value of commodities as non-arbitrary, containing meaning; then, focus not on the meaning itself but on how that meaning obtains its form: "We must, then, accomplish another crucial step and analyse the genesis of the commodity-form itself." (Zizek 15)

-- The Unconscious of the Commodity-form

"in the structure of the commodity-form it is possible to find the transcendental subject... that is, the network of transcendental categories which constitute the a priori frame of 'objective' scientific knowledge" (Zizek 16)

"The exchange of commodities implies a double abstraction: the abstraction from the changeable character of the commodity during the act of exchange and the abstraction from the concrete, empirical, sensual, particular character of the commodity (in the act of exchange, the distinct, particular qualitative determination of a commodity is not taken into account; a commodity is reduced to an abstract entity which -- irrespective of its particular nature, of its 'use-value' -- possesses 'the same value' as another commodity for which it is being exchanged)." (Zizek 17)

"The easiest way to detect the effectivity of this postulate is to think of the way we behave towards the materiality of money: we know very well that money, like all other material objects, suffers the effects of use, that its material body changes through time, but in the social *effectivity" of the market we nonetheless *treat\* coins as if they consist 'of an immutable substance, a substance over which time has no power, and which stands in antithetic contrast to any matter found in nature'...
     Here we have a problem unsolved by Marx, that of the *material* character of money: not of the empirical, material stuff money is made of, but of the *sublime* material, of that other 'indestructible and immutable' body which persists beyond the corruption of the body physical... This immaterial corporality of the 'body within the body' gives us a precise definition of the sublime object" (Zizek 18, quoting Sohn-Rethel)

"Here we have one of the possible definitions of the unconscious: *the form of thought whose ontological status is not that of thought*, that is to say, the form of thought external to the thought itself -- in short, some Other Scene external to the thought whereby the form of the thought is already articulated in advance." (Zizek 19)

"The 'real abstraction' is unthinkable in the frame of the fundamental Althusserian epistemological distinction between the 'real object' and the 'object of knowledge' in so far as it introduces a third element which subverts the very field of this distinction: the form of the thought previous and external to the thought -- in short: the symbolic order." (Zizek 19)

"This does not mean, on the other hand, that everyday 'practical' consciousness, as opposed to the philosophical-theoretical one -- the consciousness of the individuals partaking in the act of exchange -- is not also subjected to a complementary blindness.  During the act of exchange, individuals proceed as 'practical solipsists', they misrecognize the socio-synthetic function of exchange: that is the level of the 'real abstraction' as the form of socialization of private production through the medium of the market" (Zizek 20)

"This is probably the fundamental dimension of 'ideology': ideology is not simply a 'false consciousness', an illusory representation of reality, it is rather this reality itself which is already to be conceived of as 'ideological' - *'ideological' is a social reality whose very existence implies the non-knowledge of its participants as to its essence* -- that is, the social effectivity, the very reproduction of which implies that the individuals 'do not know what they are doing'. *'Ideological' is not the 'false consciousness' of a (social) being but this being itself in so far as it is supported by 'false consciousness'*.  Thus we have finally reached the dimension of the symptom, because one of its possible definitions would also be 'a formation whose very consistency implies a certain non-knowledge on the part of the subject': the subject can 'enjoy his symptom' only in so far as its logic escapes him -- the measure of the success of its interpretation is precisely its dissolution." (Zizek 21)

-- The Social Symptom

"the elementary Marxian procedure of 'criticism of ideology' is already 'symptomatic': it consists in detecting a point of breakdown *heterogenous* to a given ideological field and at the same time *necessary* for that field to achieve its closure, its accomplished form.
     This procedure thus implies a certain logic of exception: every ideological Universal -- for example freedom, equality -- is 'false' in so far as it necessarily includes a specific case which breaks its unity, lays open its falsity." (Zizek 21)

"When, in pre-capitalist society, the production of commodities has not yet attained universal character -- that is, when it is still so-called 'natural production' which predominates -- the proprietors of the means of production are still themselves producers (as a rule, at least)... But as soon as production for the market prevails in the economic edifice of a given society, this *generalization* is necessarily accompanied by the appearance of a new, paradoxical type of commodity: the labour force, the workers who are not themselves proprietors of the means of production and who are consequently obliged to see on the market their own labour instead of the products of their labour." (Zizek 22)

"the labour force is not 'exploited' in the sense that its full value is not remunerated; in principle at least, the exchange between labour and capital is wholly equivalent and equitable.  The catch is that the labour force is a peculiar commodity, the use of which -- labour itself -- produces a certain surplus-value, and it is this surplus over the value of the labour force itself which is appropriated by the capitalist." (Zizek 22)

"The 'quantitative' development itself, the universalization of the production of commodities, brings about a new 'quality', the emergence of a new commodity representing the internal negation of the universal principle of equivalent exchange of commodities; in other words, *it brings about a symptom*." (Zizek 22-23)

-- Commodity Fetishism

"commodity fetishism is 'a definite social relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things'" (Zizek 23, quoting Marx, Capital)

"the essential feature of commodity fetishism does not consist of the famous replacement of men with things ('a relation between men assumes the form of a relation between things'); rather, it consists of a certain misrecognition which concerns the relation between a structured network and one of its elements: what is really a structural effect, an effect of the network of relations between elements, appears and an immediate property of one of the elements, as if this property also belongs to it outside its relation with other elements." (Zizek 23-24)

"'Being-a-king' is an effect of the network of social relations between a 'king' and his 'subjects'; but -- and here is the fetishistic misrecognition -- to the participants of this social bond, the relationship appears necessarily in an inverse form: they think that they are subjects giving the king royal treatment because the king is already in himself, outside the relationship to his subjects, a king; as if the determination of 'being-a-king' were a 'natural' property of the person of a king." (Zizek 25)

"we cannot say that in societies in which production for the market predominates -- ultimately, that is, in capitalist societies -- 'it is with man as with commodities'.  Precisely the opposite is true: commodity fetishism occurs in capitalist societies, but in capitalism relations between men are definitely *not* 'fetishized'; what we have here are relations between 'free' people, each following his or her proper egoistic interest.  The predominant and determining form of their interrelations is not domination and servitude but a contract between free people who are equal in the eyes of the law.  Its model is the market exchange" (Zizek 25)

"This is why one had to look for the discovery of the symptom in the way Marx conceived the passage from feudalism to capitalism.  With the establishment of bourgeois society, the relations of domination and servitude are *repressed*: formally, we are apparently concerned with free subjects whose interpersonal relations are discharged of all fetishism; the repressed truth -- that of the persistence of domination and servitude -- emerges in a symptom which subverts the ideological appearance of equality, freedom, and so on." (Zizek 26)

-- Totalitarian Laughter

on Eco's _The Name of the Rose_: "What should bother us about this book is its basic underlying thesis:  the source of totalitarianism is a dogmatic attachment to the official word: the lack of laughter, of ironic detachment.  An excessive commitment to Good may in itself become the greatest Evil: real Evil is any kind of fanatical dogmatism, especially that exerted in the name of the supreme Good." (Zizek 27)

"First, this idea of an obsession with (a fanatical devotion to) Good turning into Evil masks the inverse experience, which is more disquieting: how an obsessive, fanatical attachment to Evil may in itself acquire the status of an ethical position, of a position which is not guided by our egoistical interests." (Zizek 27)

"What is really disturbing about _The Name of the Rose_, however, is the underlying belief in the liberating, anti-totalitarian force of laughter, of ironic distance.  Our thesis here is almost the exact opposite of this underlying premiss of Eco's novel: in contemporary societies, democratic or totalitarian, that cynical distance, laughter, irony, are, so to speak, part of the game.  The ruling ideology is not meant to be taken seriously or literally.  Perhaps the greatest danger for totalitarianism is people who take its ideology literally" (Zizek 28)

-- Cynicism as a Form of Ideology

"The most elementary definition of ideology is probably the well-known phrase from Marx's _Capital_... -- *'they do not know it, but they are doing it'*.  The very concept of ideology implies a kind of basic, constitutive *naïveté*: the misrecognition of its own presuppositions, of its own effective conditions, a distance, a divergence between so-called social reality and our distorted representation, our false consciousness of it." (Zizek 28)

"In the more sophisticated versions of the critics of ideology -- that developed by the Frankfurt School, for example -- it is not just a question of seeing things (that is, social reality) as they 'really are', of throwing away the distorting spectacles of ideology; the main point is to see how the reality itself cannot reproduce itself without this so-called ideological mystification." (Zizek 28)

"In the _Critique of Cynical Reason_, a great bestseller in Germany, Peter Sloterdijk puts forward the thesis that ideology's dominant mode of functioning is cynical, which renders impossible -- or more precisely, vain -- the classic critical-ideological procedure.  The cynical subject is quite aware of the distance between the ideological mask and the social reality, but he none the less still insists upon the mask.  The formula, as proposed by Sloterdijk, would then be: 'they know very well what they are doing, but still, they are doing it'." (Zizek 29)

"We must distinguish this cynical position strictly from what SLoterdijk calls *kynicism*.  Kynicism represents the popular, plebeian rejection of the official culture by means of irony and sarcasm: the classical kynical procedure is to confront the pathetic phrases of the ruling official ideology -- its solemn, grave tonality -- with everyday banality and to hold them up to ridicule, thus exposing behind the sublime *noblesse* of the ideological phrases the egotistical interests, the violence, the brutal claims to power." (Zizek 29)

"Cynicism is the answer of the ruling culture to this kynical subversion: it recognizes, it takes into account, the particular interest behind the ideological universality, the distance between the ideological mask and the reality, but it still finds reasons to retain the mask." (Zizek 29)

"the model of cynical wisdom is to conceive probity, integrity, as a supreme form of dishonesty, and morals as a supreme form of profligacy, the truth as the most effective form of a lie." (Zizek 30)

"It is clear, therefore, that confronted with such cynical reason, the traditional critique of ideology no longer works.  We can no longer subject the ideological text to 'symptomatic reading', confronting it with its blank spots, with what it must repress to organize itself, to preserve its consistency -- cynical reason takes this distance into account in advance.  Is the the only issue left to us to affirm that, with the reign of cynical reason, we find ourselves in the so-called post-ideological world?" (Zizek 30)

"cynical reason, with all its ironic detachment, leaves untouched the fundamental level of ideological fantasy, the level on which ideology structures the social reality itself." (Zizek 30)

-- Ideological Fantasy

"Let us take again the classic Marxian example of so-called commodity fetishism: money is in reality just an embodiment, a condensation, a materialization of a network of social relations -- the fact that it functions as a universal equivalent of all commodities is conditioned by its position in the texture of social relations.  But to the individuals themselves, this function of money -- to be the embodiment of wealth -- appears as an immediate, natural property of a thing called 'money', as if money is already in itself, in its immediate material reality, the embodiment of wealth.  Here, we have touched upon the classic Marxist motive of 'reification': behind the things, the relation between things, we must detect the social relations, the relations between human subjects.
     But such a reading of the Marxian formula leaves out an illusion, an error, a distortion which is already at work in the social reality itself, at the level of what the individuals are *doing*, and not only what they *think* or *know* they are doing.  When individuals use money, they know very well that there is nothing magical about it... The problem is that in their social activity itself, in what they are *doing*, they are *acting* as if money, in its material reality, is the immediate embodiment of wealth as such.  They are fetishists in practice, not in theory." (Zizek 31)

"we have established a new way to read the Marxian formula 'they do not know it, but they are doing it': the illusion is not on the side of knowledge, it is already on the side of reality itself, of what the people are doing.  What they do not know is that their social reality itself, their activity, is guided by an illusion, by a fetishistic inversion.  What they overlook, what they misrecognize, is not the reality but the illusion which is structuring their reality, their real social activity.  They know very well how things really are, but still they are doing it as if they did not know.  The illusion is therefore double: it consists in overlooking the illusion which is structuring our real, effective relationship to reality.  And this overlooked, unconscious illusion is what may be called the *ideological fantasy*." (Zizek 32-33)

"The fundamental truth of ideology, however, is not of an illusion masking the real state of things but that of an (unconscious) fantasy structuring our social reality itself.  And at this level, we are of course far from being post-ideological society." (Zizek 33)

-- The Objectivity of Belief

"Although in capitalism the subjects are emancipated, perceiving themselves as free from medieval religious superstitions, when they deal with one another they do so as rational utilitarians, guided only by their selfish interests.  The point of Marx's analysis, however, is that *the things (commodities) themselves believe in their place*, instead of the subjects: it is as if all their beliefs, superstitions and metaphysical mystifications, supposedly surmounted by the rational, utilitarian personality, are embodied in the 'social relations between things'.  They no longer believe, *but the things themselves believe for them*." (Zizek 34)

"But to avoid the impression that this exteriorization, this transference of our most intimate feeling, is simply a characteristic of the so-called primitive stages of development, let us remind ourselves of a phenomenon quite usual in popular television shows or serials: 'canned laughter'.... why this laughter? The first possible answer -- that it serves to remind us when to laugh -- is interesting enough, because it implies the paradox that laughter is a matter or duty and not of some spontaneous feeling; but this answer is not sufficient because we do *not* usually laugh.  The only correct answer would be that the Other -- embodied in the television set -- is relieving us even of our duty to laugh -- is laughing instead of us." (Zizek 35)

-- 'Law is Law'

"The lesson to be drawn from this concerning the social field is above all that belief, far from being an 'intimate', purely mental state, is always *materialized* in our effective social activity: belief supports the fantasy which regulates social reality." (Zizek 36)

"What we call 'social reality' is in the last resort an ethical construction; it is supported by a certain *as if* (we act *as if* we believe in the almightiness of bureaucracy, *as if* the President incarnates the Will of the People, *as if* the Party expresses the objective interest of the working class...).  As soon as the belief (which, let us remind ourselves again, is definitely not to be conceived at a 'psychological' level: it is embodied, materialized, in the effective functioning of the social field) is lost, the very texture of the social field disintegrates." (Zizek 36, ellipsis in original)

"It follows, from this constitutively senseless character of the Law, that we must obey it not because it is just, good or even beneficial, but simply *because it is the law*" (Zizek 37)

"The only real obedience, then, is an 'external' one: obedience out of conviction is not real obedience because it is already 'mediated' through our subjectivity -- that is, we are not really obeying the authority but simply following our judgement, which tells us that the authority deserves to be obeyed in so far as it is good, wise, beneficent..." (Zizek 37, ellipsis in original)

"Certainly we must search for rational reasons which can substantiate our belief, our obedience to the religious command, but the crucial religious experience is that these reasons reveal themselves only to those who already believe" (Zizek 37)

"But for the Law to function 'normally', this traumatic fact that 'custom is the whole of equity for the sole reason that it is accepted' -- the dependence of the Law on its process of enunciation or, to use a concept developed by Laclau and Mouffe, its radically *contingent* character -- must be repressed into the unconscious, through the ideological, imaginary experience of the 'meaning' of the Law, of its foundation in Justice, Truth (or, in a more modern way, functionality)" (Zizek 37-38)

"The necessary structural illusion which drives people to believe that truth can be found in laws describes precisely the mechanism of *transference*: transference is this supposition of a Truth, of a Meaning behind the stupid, traumatic, inconsistent fact of the Law.  In other words, 'transference' names the vicious circle of belief: the reasons why we should believe are persuasive only to those who already believe." (Zizek 38)

"Pascal's final answer, then, is: leave rational argumentation and submit yourself simply to ideological ritual, stupefy yourself by repeating the meaningless gestures, act *as if* you already believe, and the belief will come by itself." (Zizek 39)

"What distinguishes the Pascalian 'custom' from insipid behaviourist wisdom ('the content of your belief is conditioned by your factual behaviour') is the paradoxical status of a *belief before belief*: by following a custom, the subject believes without knowing it, so that the final conversion is merely a formal act by means of which we recognize what we have already believed.  In other words, what the behaviourist reading of Pascalian 'custom' misses is the crucial fact that the external custom is always a material support for the subject's unconscious." (Zizek 40)

"This is, of course, the very Lacanian definition of deception in its specifically human dimension, where we deceive the Other by means of the truth itself: in a universe in which all are looking for the true face beneath the mask, the best way to lead them astray is to wear the mask of truth itself." (Zizek 42)

-- Kafka, Critic of Althusser

"The externality of the symbolic machine ('automaton') is therefore not simply external: it is at the same time the place where the fate of our internal, most 'sincere' and 'intimate' beliefs is in advance stages and decided.  When we subject ourselves to the machine of a religious ritual, we already believe without knowing it; our belief is already materialized in the external ritual; in other words, we already believe *unconsciously*, because it is from this external character of the symbolic machine that we can explain the status of the unconscious as radically external -- that of a dead letter." (Zizek 43)

on Althusser's ISAs:  "the weak point of his theory is that he or his school never succeeded in thinking out the link between Ideological State Apparatuses and ideological interpellation: how does the Ideological State Apparatus (the Pascalian 'machine', the signifying automatism) 'internalize' itself; how does it produce the effect of ideological belief in a Cause and the interconnecting effect of subjectivation, of recognition of one's ideological position?  The answer to this is, as we have seen, that this external 'machine' of State Apparatuses exercises its force only in so far as it is experienced, in the unconscious economy of the subject, as a traumatic, senseless injunction." (Zizek 43)

"we can learn from Pascal that this 'internalization', by structural necessity, never fully succeeds, that there is always a residue, a leftover, a stain of traumatic irrationality and senselessness sticking to it, and that *this leftover, far from hindering the full submission of the subject to the ideological command, is the very condition of it*: it is precisely this non-integrated surplus of senseless traumatism which confers on the Law its unconditional authority" (Zizek 43)

on Kafka as a critique, avant la lettre, of Althusser:  "In a first approach, the starting point in Kafka's novels is that of an interpellation: the Kafkaesque subject is interpellated by a mysterious bureaucratic entity (Law, Castle).  But this interpellation has a somewhat strange look:  it is, so to say, an *interpellation without identification/subjectivation*; it does not offer us a cause with which to identify -- the Kafkaesque subject is the subject desperately seeking a trait with which to identify, he does not understand the meaning of the call of the Other."' (Zizek 44)

"Let us explain by starting from the fundamental Lacanian thesis that in the opposition between dream and reality, fantasy is on the side of reality:  it is, as Lacan once said, the support that gives consistency to what we call 'reality'." (Zizek 44)

"The subject does not awake himself when the external irritation becomes too strong... the thing that he encounters in the dream, the reality of his desire, the Lacanian Real -- in our case, the reality of the child's reproach to his father, 'Can't you see that I am burning?', implying the father's fundamental guilt -- is more terrifying than so-called external reality itself, and that is why he awakens: to escape the Real of his desire, which announces itself in the terrifying dream." (Zizek 45)

"Ideology is not a dreamlike illusion that we build to escape insupportable reality; in its basic dimension it is a fantasy-construction which serves as a support for our 'reality' itself: an 'illusion' which structures our effective, real social relations and thereby masks some insupportable, real, impossible kernel... The function of ideology is not to offer us a point of escape from our reality but to offer us the social reality itself as an escape from some traumatic, real kernel." (Zizek 45)

-- Fantasy as a Support of Reality

"This problem must be approached from the Lacanian thesis that it is only in the dream that we come close to the real awakening -- that is, to the Real of our desire.  When Lacan says that the last support of what we call 'reality' is a fantasy, this is definitely not to be understood in the sense of 'life is just a dream', 'what we call reality is just an illusion', and so forth.  We find such a theme in  many science-fiction stories: reality as a generalized dream or illusion... The Lacanian thesis is, on the contrary, that there is always a hard kernel, a leftover which persists and cannot be reduced to a universal play of illusory mirroring.  The difference between Lacan and 'naïve realism' is that for Lacan, *the only point at which we approach this hard kernel of the Real is indeed the dream*." (Zizek 47)

"The only way to break the power of our ideological dream is to confront the Real of our desire which announces itself in this dream." (Zizek 48)

"The proper answer to anti-Semitism is therefore not 'Jews are really not like that' but 'the anti-Semitic idea of Jew has nothing to do with Jews; the ideological figure of a Jew is a way to stitch up the inconsistency of our own ideological system." (Zizek 48)

"An ideology is really 'holding us' only when we do not feel any opposition between it and reality -- that is, when the ideology succeeds in determining the mode of our everyday experience of reality itself... An ideology really succeeds when even the facts which at first sight contradict it start to function as arguments in its favour." (Zizek 49)

-- Surplus-value and Surplus-enjoyment

"Herein lies the difference with Marxism:  in the predominant Marxist perspective the ideological gaze is a *partial* gaze overlooking the *totality* of social relations, whereas in the Lacanian perspective ideology rather designates *a totality set on effacing the traces of its own impossibility*." (Zizek 49)

"if over-rapid universalization produces a quasi-universal Image whose function is to make us blind to its historical, socio-symbolic determination, over-rapid historicization makes us blind to the real kernel which returns as the same through diverse historicizations/ symbolizations." (Zizek 50)

"the point is not that, at a certain moment of its development, the frame of the relation of production starts to constrict further development of the productive forces; the point is that *it is this very immanent limit, this 'internal contradiction', which drives capitalism into permanent development*.... incessant development is the only way for it to resolve again and again, come to terms with, its own fundamental, constitutive imbalance, 'contradiction'.  Far from constricting, its limit is thus the very impetus of its development." (Zizek 52)

"It is this paradox which defines surplus-enjoyment: it is not a surplus which simply attaches itself to some 'normal', fundamental enjoyment, because *enjoyment as such emerges only in this surplus*, because it is constitutively an 'excess'." (Zizek 52)

"Is not the paradoxical topology of the movement of capital, the fundamental blockage which resolves and reproduces itself through frenetic activity, *excessive* power as the very form of appearance of a fundamental *impotence* -- this immediate passage, this coincidence of limit and excess, of lack and surplus -- precisely that of the Lacanian *objet petit a*, of the leftover which embodies the fundamental, constitutive lack?" (Zizek 53)

"How can we not detect in this formulation the fact that Marx failed to cope with the paradoxes of surplus-enjoyment?  And the ironic vengeance of history for this failure is that today there exists a society which seems to correspond perfectly to this vulgar evolutionary dialectics of forces and relation" (Zizek 53)


2.  From Symptom to *Sinthome*

- The Dialectics of Symptom

-- Back to the Future

"The Lacanian answer to the question: From where does the repressed return? is therefore, paradoxically: From the future.  Symptoms are meaningless traces, their meaning is not discovered, excavated from the hidden depth of the past, but constructed retroactively" (Zizek 55-56)

"Thus, 'things which mean nothing all of a sudden signify something, but in a quite different domain'.  What is a 'journey into the future' if not this 'overtaking' by means of which we suppose in advance the presence in the other of a certain knowledge -- knowledge about the meaning of our symptoms -- what is it, then, if not the *transference* itself?" (Zizek 56)

"the symptom as a 'return of the repressed' is precisely such an effect which precedes its cause (its hidden kernel, its meaning)" (Zizek 56)

"only through this additional detour does the past itself, the 'objective' state of things, become retroactively what it always was." (Zizek 57)

"This, therefore, is the basic paradox we are aiming at:  the subject is confronted with a scene from the past that he wants to change, to meddle with, to intervene in; he takes a journey into the past, intervenes in the scene, and it is not that he 'cannot change anything' -- quite the contrary, only through his intervention does the scene from the past *become what it always was*: his intervention was from the beginning comprised, included." (Zizek 57-58)

-- Repetition in History

"the first seizures of power *are necessarily 'premature'*: the only way for the working class to reach its 'maturity', to await the arrival of the 'appropriate moment' for the seizure of power, is to form itself, to educate itself for this act of seizure, and the only possible way of achieving this education is precisely the 'premature' attempts.... If we merely wait for the 'appropriate moment' we will never live to see it, because this 'appropriate moment' cannot arrive without the subjective conditions of the maturity of the revolutionary force (subject) being fulfilled" (Zizek 59)

"the revolutionary subject does not 'conduct', 'direct' this process from an objective distance, he is constituted through this process, and because of this -- because the temporality of the revolution passes through subjectivity -- we cannot 'make the revolution at the right moment without the previous 'premature', failed attempts." (Zizek 59-60)

"The whole problem of repetition is here: in this passage from Caesar (the name of an individual) to caesar (title of the Roman emperor).  The murder of Caesar -- historical personality -- provoked, as its final result, the installation of *caesarism: Caesar-person repeats itself as caesar-title*.  What is the reason, the driving force of this repetition?  At first sign the answer seems to be clear: the delay of the consciousness as to the 'objective' historical necessity." (Zizek 60-61)

"repetition is the way historical necessity asserts itself in the eyes of 'opinion'." (Zizek 61)

"What is lost in this notion is the way so-called historical necessity itself *is constituted through misrecognition*, through the initial failure of 'opinion' to recognize its true character -- that is, the way truth itself arises from misrecognition." (Zizek 61)

"In other words, the repetition announces the advent of the Law, of the Name-of-the-Father in place of the dead, assassinated father: the event which repeats itself receives its law retroactively, through repetition." (Zizek 61-62)

"Hegel was thus probably the first to articulate the *delay* which is constitutive of the act of interpretation: the interpretation always sets in too late, with some delay, when the event which is to be interpreted repeats itself; the event cannot already be lawlike in its first advent." (Zizek 62)

-- Hegel with Austen

on Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_:  "The theoretical interest of this story lies in the fact that the failure of their first encounter, the double misrecognition concerning the real nature of the other, functions as a positive condition of the final outcome: we cannot go directly for the truth, we cannot say 'If, from the very beginning, she had recognized his real nature and he hers, their story could have ended at once with their marriage'." (Zizek 63)

"If we want to spare ourselves the painful roundabout route through the misrecognition, we miss the Truth itself: only the 'working-through' of the misrecognition allows us to accede to the true nature of the other and at the same time to overcome our own deficiency" (Zizek 63)

"To articulate things in Hegelian terms: in the perceived deficiency of the other, *each perceives* -- without knowing it -- *the falsity of his/her own subjective position*; the deficiency of the other is simply an objectification of the distortion of our own point of view." (Zizek 64)

-- Two Hegelian Jokes

"The Pole's error is simply his perspective: he looks forward to the 'secret' being revealed somewhere at the end; he situates the Jew's narration as a path to the final revelation of the 'secret'; but the real 'secret' is already in the narration itself: in the way the Jew, through his narration, captures the Pole's desire; in the way the Pole is absorbed in this narration and prepared to pay for it." (Zizek 65)

"The fascinating 'secret' which drives us to follow the Jew's narration carefully is precisely the Lacanian *objet petit a*, the chimerical object of fantasy, the object causing our desire and at the same time -- this is its paradox -- posed retroactively by this desire; in 'going through the fantasy' we experience how this fantasy-object (the 'secret') only materializes the void of our desire." (Zizek 65)

"the solution is the same in both cases: the subject has to grasp how, from the very start of the game, the door concealing the secret was meant only for him, how the real secret at the end of the Jew's narration is his own desire -- in short, how his external position *vis-à-vis* the Other (the fact that he experiences himself as excluded from the secret of the Other) is internal to the Other itself." (Zizek 66)

-- A Time Trap

"Let us take, for example, the Lacanian notion of the imaginary self: this self exists only on the basis of the misrecognition of its own conditions; it is the effect of this misrecognition.  So Lacan's emphasis is not on the supposed incapacity of the self to reflect, to grasp its own conditions -- on its being the plaything of inaccessible unconscious forces: his point is that the subject can pay for such a reflection with the loss of his very ontological consistency.  It is in this sense that the knowledge which we approach through psychoanalysis is impossible-real: we are on dangerous ground; in getting too close to it we observe suddenly how our consistency, our positivity, is dissolving itself." (Zizek 68)

"to abolish the misrecognition means at the same time to abolish, to dissolve, the 'substance' which was supposed to hide itself behind the form-illusion of misrecognition.  This 'substance' -- the only one recognized in psychoanalysis -- is, according to Lacan, enjoyment [*jouissance*]: access to knowledge is then paid with the loss of enjoyment -- enjoyment, in its stupidity, is possible only on the basis of certain non-knowledge, ignorance." (Zizek 68)

- Symptom as Real

-- The *Titanic* as Symptom

"In the perspective of the last stage of Lacanian teaching, it is precisely the symptom which is conceived as such a real kernel of enjoyment, which persists as a surplus and returns through all attempts to domesticate it, to gentrify it" (Zizek 69)

"the wreck of the *Titanic* made such a tremendous impact not because of the immediate material dimensions of the catastrophe but because of its symbolic overdetermination, because of the ideological meaning invested in it: it was read as a 'symbol', as a condensed, metaphorical representation of the approaching catastrophe of European civilization itself." (Zizek 70)

"The *Titanic* is a Thing in the Lacanian sense: the material leftover, the materialization of the terrifying, impossible *jouissance*." (Zizek 71)

"The wreck of the *Titanic* therefore functions as a sublime object: a positive, material object elevated to the status of the impossible Thing." (Zizek 71)

-- From Symptom to *Sinthome*

"This, then, is the symptom -- and it is on the basis of this notion of the symptom that we must locate the fact that in the final years of Lacan's teaching we find a kind of universalization of the symptom: almost everything that is becomes in a way symptom, so that finally even woman is determined as the symptom of man." (Zizek 71)

"At this point we must of course ask ourselves the naïve but necessary question: If the world and language and subject do not exist, what *does* exist; more precisely: what confers on existing phenomena their consistency? Lacan's answer is, as we have already indicated, symptom.  To this answer, we must give its whole anti-post-structuralist emphasis: the fundamental gesture of post-structuralism is to deconstruct every substantial identity, to denounce behind its solid consistency an interplay of symbolic overdetermination -- briefly, to dissolve the substantial identity into a network of non-substantial, differential relations; the notion of symptom is the necessary component to it, the substance of enjoyment, the real kernel around which this signifying interplay is structured." (Zizek 72)

"When Lacan introduced the notion of foreclosure in the fifties, it designated a specific phenomenon of the exclusion of a certain key-signifier (*point de capiton*, Name-of-the-Father) from the symbolic order, triggering the psychotic process; here, the foreclosure is not proper to language as such but a distinctive feature of the psychotic phenomena.  And, as Lacan reformulated Freud, what was foreclosed from the Symbolic returns in the Real -- in the form of hallucinatory phenomena, for example." (Zizek 72)

"At the beginning, in the early fifties, symptom was conceived as a symbolic, signifying formation, as a kind of cypher, a coded message addressed to the big Other which later was supposed to confer on it its true meaning.  The symptom arises where the world failed, where the circuit of the symbolic communication was broken: it is a kind of 'prolongation of the communication by other means'; the failed, repressed word articulates itself in a coded, cyphered form.  The implication of this is that the symptom can not only be interpreted but is, so to speak, already formed with an eye to its interpretation: it is addressed to the big Other presumed to contain its meaning." (Zizek 73)

"Precisely as an enigma, the symptom, so to speak, announces its dissolution through interpretation: the aim of psychoanalysis is to reestablish the broken network of communication by allowing the patient to verbalize the meaning of his symptom: through this verbalization, the symptom is automatically dissolved." (Zizek 73)

"But here the problems began: why, in spite of its interpretation, does the symptom not dissolve itself; why does it persist?  The Lacanian answer is, of course, *enjoyment*." (Zizek 74)

"symptom is a signifying formation which, so to speak, 'overtakes itself' towards its interpretation -- that is, which can be analysed; fantasy is an inert construction which cannot be analysed, which resists interpretation." (Zizek 74)

"But here again another problem arose: how do we account for patients who have, beyond any doubt, gone through their fantasy, who have obtained distance from the fantasy-framework of their reality, but whose key symptom still persists?... Lacan tried to answer this challenge with the concept of *sinthome*, a neologism containing a set of associations (synthetic-artificial man, synthesis between symptom and fantasy, Saint Thomas, the saint...). Symptom as *sinthome* is a certain signifying formation penetrated with enjoyment: it is a signifier as a bearer of *jouis-sense*, enjoyment-in-sense." (Zizek 74-75)

"What we must bear in mind here is the radical ontological status of symptom: symptom, conceived as *sinthome*, is literally our only substance, the only positive support of our being, the only point that gives consistency to the subject.  In other words, symptom is the way we -- the subjects -- 'avoid madness', the way we 'chose something (the symptom-formation) instead of nothing (radical psychotic autism, the destruction of the symbolic universe); through the binding of our enjoyment to a certain signifying, symbolic formation which assures a minimum of consistency to our being-in-the-world." (Zizek 75)

"That is why the final Lacanian definition of the end of the psychoanalytic process is *identification with the symptom*.  The analysis achieves its end when the patient is able to recognize, in the Real of his symptom, the only support of his being." (Zizek 75)

"Now it is perhaps clear why woman is, according to Lacan, a symptom of man -- to explain this, we need only remember the well-known male chauvinist wisdom often referred to by Freud: women are impossible to bear, a source of eternal nuisance, but still, they are the best thing we have of their kind; without them, it would be even worse.  So, if woman does not exist, man is perhaps simply a woman who thinks that she does exist." (Zizek 75)

-- 'in you more than yourself'

"In so far as the *sinthome* is a certain signifier which is not enchained in a network but immediately filled, penetrated with enjoyment, its status is by definition 'psychosomatic', that of a terrifying bodily mark which is merely a mute attestation bearing witness to a disgusting enjoyment, without representing anything or anyone." (Zizek 76)

"This is the symptom: an element which causes a great deal of trouble, but its absence would mean even greater trouble: total catastrophe." (Zizek 78)

"From this perspective of *sinthome*, truth and enjoyment are radically incompatible: the dimension of truth is opened through our misrecognition of the traumatic Thing, embodying the impossible *jouissance*." (Zizek 79)

-- Ideological *Jouissance*

"With the designation of an inconsistency of the socio-symbolic Other, the positive side of which is obscene enjoyment, have we not consented also to the usual 'post-modernist' anti-Enlightenment *ressentiment*?  The text on the cover of the French edition of Lacan's _Écrits_ already belies such an understanding: Lacan conceives there his theoretical effort explicitly as a prolongation of the old struggle of Enlightenment." (Zizek 79)

"as the autonomous subject of theoretical reflection, addressing the enlightened public, you can think freely, you can question all authority; but as a part of the social 'machine', as a subject in the other meaning of the word, you must obey unconditionally the orders of your superiors." (Zizek 80)

"through this acceptance of the customs and rules of social life in their nonsensical, given character, through acceptance of the fact that 'Law is law', we are internally freed from its constraints -- the way is open for free theoretical reflection." (Zizek 80)

"we could say that the principal illusion of the Enlightenment consists in the idea that we can preserve a simple distance from the external 'machine' of social customs and thus keep the space of our inner reflection spotless, unblemished by the externality of customs.... The Kantian categorical imperative is precisely a Law which has a necessary, unconditional authority, without being true; it is -- in Kant's own words -- a kind of 'transcendental fact', a given fact the truth of which cannot be theoretically demonstrated; but its unconditional validity should nonetheless be presupposed for our moral activity to have any sense." (Zizek 80-81)

"The ultimate paradox of Kant is this priority of practical over theoretical reason: we can free ourselves of external social constraints and achieve the maturity proper to the autonomous enlightened subject precisely by submitting to the 'irrational' compulsion of the categorical imperative." (Zizek 81)

"It is a commonplace of Lacanian theory to emphasize how this Kantian moral imperative conceals an obscene superego injunction: 'Enjoy!' -- the voice of the Other impelling us to follow our duty for the sake of duty is a traumatic irruption of an appeal to impossible *jouissance*, disrupting the homeostasis of the pleasure principle and its prolongation, the reality principle." (Zizek 81)

"The moral Law is obscene in so far as it is its form itself which functions as a motivating force driving us to obey its command -- that is, in so far as we obey moral Law because it is law and not because of a set of positive reasons: the obscenity of moral Law is the obverse of its formal character." (Zizek 81)

"the Fascist ideology is based upon a purely formal imperative: Obey, because you must!  In other words, renounce enjoyment, sacrifice yourself and do not ask about the meaning of it -- the value of the sacrifice lies in its very meaninglessness; true sacrifice is for its own end; you must find positive fulfilment in the sacrifice itself, not in its instrumental value; it is this renunciation, this giving up of enjoyment itself, which produces a certain surplus-enjoyment." (Zizek 82)

"the real aim of ideology is the attitude demanded by it, the consistency of the ideological form, the fact that we 'continue to walk as straight as we can in one direction'; the positive reasons given by ideology to justify this request -- to make us obey ideological form -- are there only to conceal this fact: in other words, to conceal the surplus-enjoyment proper to the ideological form as such." (Zizek 83)

"Why must this inversion of the relation of aim and means remain hidden, why is its revelation self-defeating? Because it would reveal the enjoyment which is at work in ideology, in the ideological renunciation itself.  In other words, it would reveal that ideology serves only its own purpose, that it does not serve anything -- which is precisely the Lacanian definition of *jouissance*." (Zizek 84)


Part II:  Lack in the Other

3.  'Che Vuoi?'

- Identity

-- The Ideological 'Quilt'

"What creates and sustains the *identity* of a given ideological field beyond all possible variations of its positive content?  _Hegemony and Socialist Strategy_ delineates what is probably the definitive answer to this crucial question of the theory of ideology: the multitude of 'floating signifiers', of proto-ideological elements, is structured into a unified field through the intervention of a certain 'nodal point' (the Lacanian *point de capiton*) which 'quilts' them, stops their sliding and fixes their meaning." (Zizek 87)

"What is at stake in the ideological struggle is which of the 'nodal points', *points de capiton*, will totalize, include in its series of equivalences, these free-floating elements." (Zizek 88)

"In this way, every element of a given ideological field is part of a series of equivalences: its metaphorical surplus, through which it is connected with all other elements, determines retroactively its very identity (in a Communist perspective, to fight for peace *means* to fight against the capitalist order, and so on).  But this enchainment is possible only on condition that a certain signifier -- the Lacanian 'One' -- 'quilts' the whole field and, by embodying it, effectuates its identity." (Zizek 88)

"The first task of the analysis is therefore to isolate, in a given ideological field, the particular struggle which at the same time determines the horizon of its totality... how do we formulate the determining role of a certain particular domain without falling into a trap of essentialism?" (Zizek 89)

-- Descriptivism versus Antidescriptivism

"The stake of the dispute between descriptivism and antidescriptivism is the most elementary one: how do names refer to the objects they denote?  Why does the word 'table' refer to a table?  The descriptivist answer is the obvious one: because of its meaning; every word is in the first place the bearer of a certain meaning -- that is, it means a cluster of descriptive features ('table' means an object of a certain shape, serving certain purposes) and subsequently refers to objects in reality in so far as they possess properties designated by the cluster of descriptions.... The antidescriptivist answer, in contrast, is that a word is connected to an object or a set of objects through an act of 'primal baptism', and this link maintains itself even if the cluster of descriptive features which initially determined the meaning of the word changes completely." (Zizek 89-90)

"This is the core of the dispute: descriptivists emphasize the immanent, internal 'intentional contents' of a word, while antidescriptivists regard as decisive the external causal link, the way a word has been transmitted from subject to subject in a chain of tradition." (Zizek 90)

"How could we overlook the libidinal contents of these propositions of Kripke? What is at stake here is precisely the problem of the 'fulfilment of desire': when we encounter in reality an object which has all the properties of the fantasized object of desire, we are nevertheless necessarily somewhat disappointed; we experience a certain 'this is not it'; it becomes evident that the finally found real object is not the reference of desire even though it possesses all the required properties." (Zizek 91-92)

-- The Two Myths

"Lacanian theory can help us to clarify the terms of this dispute, not in the sense of any quasi-dialectical 'synthesis' between the two opposing views but, on the contrary, by pointing out how both descriptivism and antidescriptivism *miss the same crucial point* -- the radical contingency of naming." (Zizek 92)

"a necessary constituent of every 'normal' use of names in language as a social bond -- and this tautological constituent is the Lacanian master-signifier, the 'signifier without signified'" (Zizek 93)

"If, consequently, Searle's descriptivism misses the dimension of the *big Other*, antidescriptivism -- at least in its predominant version -- misses the *small other*, the dimension of the object as real in the Lacanian sense: the distinction real/reality" (Zizek 94)

"What is overlooked, at least in the standard version of antidescriptivism, is that this guaranteeing the identity of an object in all counterfactual situations -- through a change of all its descriptive features -- is *the retroactive effect of naming itself*: it is the name itself, the signifier, which supports the identity of the object.  That 'surplus' in the object which stays the same in all possible worlds is 'something in it more than itself', that is to say the Lacanian *object petit a*: we search in vain for it in positive reality because it has no positive constituency -- because it is just an objectification of a void, of a discontinuity opened in reality by the emergence of the signifier." (Zizek 94-95)

"the radical contingency of naming, the fact that naming itself retroactively constitutes its reference.  Naming is necessary but it is, so to speak, necessary afterwards, retroactively, once we are already 'in it'." (Zizek 95)

"The main achievement of antidescriptivism is to enable us to conceive *objet a* as the real-impossible correlative of the 'rigid designator' -- that is, of the *point de capiton* as 'pure' signifier." (Zizek 95)

-- Rigid Designator and *objet a*

"the *point de capiton* is rather the word which, *as a word*, on the level of the signifier itself, unifies a given field, constitutes its identity: it is, so to speak, the word to which 'things' themselves refer to recognize themselves in their unity." (Zizek 95-96)

"the point is not that Coca-Cola 'connotes' a certain ideological experience-vision of America (the freshness of its sharp, cold taste, and so on); the point is that this vision of American itself achieves its identity by identifying itself with the signifier 'Coke'" (Zizek 96)

"The 'rigid designator' aims, then, at that impossible-real kernel, at what is 'in an object more than the object', at this surplus produced by the signifying operation.  And the crucial point to grasp is the connection between the radical contingency of naming and the logic of emergence of the 'rigid designator' through which a given object achieves its identity." (Zizek 97)

"It is because the Real itself offers no support for a direct symbolization of it -- because every symbolization is in the last resort contingent -- that the only way the experience of a given historic reality can achieve its unity is through the agency of a signifier, through reference to a 'pure' signifier.... Historical reality is of course always symbolized; the way we experience it is always mediated through different modes of symbolization: all Lacan adds to this phenomenological common wisdom is the fact that the unity of a given 'experience of meaning', itself the horizon of an ideological field of meaning, is supported by some 'pure', meaningless 'signifier without the signified'." (Zizek 97)

-- The Ideological Anamorphosis

"the essentialist illusion consists in the belief that it is possible to determine a definite cluster of features, of positive properties, however minimal, which defines the permanent essence of 'democracy' and similar terms... In contrast to this 'essentialist illusion', Laclau's anti-essentialism compels us to conclude that it is impossible to define any such essence, any cluster of positive properties which would remain the same in 'all possible worlds'...
     In the last resort, the only way to define 'democracy' is to say that it contains all political movements and organizations which legitimize, designate themselves as 'democratic'" (Zizek 98)

"the only possible definition of an object in its identity is that this is the object which is always designated by the same signifier -- tied to the same signifier.  It is the signifier which constitutes the kernel of the object's 'identity'." (Zizek 98)

"This then is the fundamental paradox of the *point de capiton*: the 'rigid designator', which totalizes an ideology by bringing to a halt the metonymic sliding of its signified, is not a point of supreme density of Meaning, a kind of Guarantee which, by being itself excepted from the differential interplay of elements, would serve as a stable and fixed point of reference.  On the contrary, it is the element which represents the agency of the signifier within the field of the signified.  In itself it is nothing but a 'pure difference': its role is purely structural, its nature is purely performative -- its significant coincides withe its own act of enunciation; in short, it is a 'signifier without the signified'.... A 'Jew', for example, is in the last resort one who is stigmatized with the signifier 'Jew'; all the phantasmatic richness of the traits supposed to characterize Jews (avidity, the spirit of intrigue, and so on) is here to conceal not the face that 'Jews are not really like that', not the empirical reality of Jews, but the fact that in the anti-Semitic construction of a 'Jew', we are concerned with a purely structural form." (Zizek 99)

"a certain 'error of perspective': the element which represents within the field of Meaning, the agency of pure signifier... is perceived as a point of extreme saturation of Meaning, as the point which 'gives meaning' to all the others and thus totalizes the field of (ideological) meaning." (Zizek 99)

"We could denote this 'error of perspective as *ideological anamorphosis*." (Zizek 99)

as in Holbein's "The Ambassadors":  "if we look at the element which holds together the ideological edifice, at this 'phallic', erected Guarantee of Meaning, from the right (or, more precisely -- politically speaking -- left) perspective, we are able to recognize in it the embodiment of a lack, of a chasm of non-sense gaping in the midst of ideological meaning." (Zizek 99-100)

- Identification (Lower Level of the Graph of Desire)

-- Retroactivity of Meaning

lots of stuff on the Lacanian graph of desire

"The *point de capiton* is the point through which the subject is 'sewn to the signifier, and at the same time the point which interpellates individual into subject by addressing it with the call of a certain master signifier ('Communism', 'God', 'Freedom', 'America') -- in a word, it is the point of the subjectivation of the signifier's chain." (Zizek 101)

"Lacan's emphasis is precisely on this retroactive character of the effect of signification with respect to the signifier, on this staying behind of the signified with respect to the progression of the signifier's chain: the effect of meaning is always produced backwards, *après coup*." (Zizek 101)

"the basic mechanism that produces the illusion proper to the phenomena of transference: transference is the obverse of the staying behind of the signified with respect to the stream of the signifiers; it consists of the illusion that the meaning of a certain element (which was retroactively fixed by the intervention of the master-signifier) was present in it from the very beginning as its immanent essence.... The paradox lies, of course, in the fact that this transferential illusion is necessary, it is the very measure of success of the operation of 'quilting': the *capitonnage* is successful only in so far as it effaces its own traces." (Zizek 102)

-- The 'Effect of Retroversion'

"the fundamental Lacanian thesis concerning the relation between signifier and signified: instead of the linear, immanent, necessary progression according to which meaning unfolds itself from some initial kernel, we have a radically contingent process of retroactive production of meaning." (Zizek 102)

"we are dealing here with the 'effect of retroversion' -- with the transferential illusion according to which the subject becomes at every stage 'what it always already was': a retroactive effect is experienced as something which was already there from the beginning." (Zizek 104)

"The 'effect of retroversion' is based precisely upon this imaginary level -- it is supported by the illusion of the self as the autonomous agent which is present from the very beginning as the origin of its acts" (Zizek 104)

-- Image and Gaze

"The relation between imaginary and symbolic identification -- between the ideal ego [*Idealich*] and the ego-ideal [*Ich-Ideal*] -- is... that between 'constituted' and 'constitutive' identification: to put it simply, imaginary identification is identification with the image in which we appear to be likeable to ourselves, with the image representing 'what we would like to be', and symbolic identification, identification with the very place *from where* we are being observed, *from where* we look at ourselves so that we appear to ourselves likeable, worthy of love." (Zizek 105)

"the trait-of-identification can also be a certain failure, weakness, guilt of the other, so that by pointing out the failure we can unwittingly reinforce the identification." (Zizek 105-106)

"But the second, even more serious error is to overlook the fact that imaginary identification is always identification *on behalf of a certain gaze in the Other*." (Zizek 106)

-- From i(o) to I(O)

"the Lacanian theory of forename and family name: the first name designates the ideal ego, the point of imaginary identification, while the family name comes from the father -- it designates, as the Name-of-the-Father, the point of symbolic identification, the agency through which we observe and judge ourselves.  The fact that should not be overlooked in this distinction is that *i(o)* is always already subordinated to I(O): it is the symbolic identification (the point from which we are observed) which dominates and determines the image, the imaginary form in which we appear to ourselves likeable." (Zizek 108)

"But why precisely is this difference between how we see ourselves and the point from which we are being observed the difference between imaginary and symbolic?  In a first approach, we could say that in imaginary identification we imitate the other at the level of resemblance -- we identify ourselves with the image of the other inasmuch as we are 'like him', while in symbolic identification we identify ourselves with the other precisely at a point at which he is inimitable, at the point which eludes resemblance." (Zizek 109)

- Beyond Identification (Upper Level of the Graph of Desire)

-- *'Che vuoi?'*

"the persistence of a gap between utterance and its enunciation: at the level of utterance you're saying this, but what do you want to tell me with it, through it?  (In the established terms of speech acts theory, we could of course denote this gap as the difference between locution and the illocutionary force of a given utterance.)" (Zizek 111)

"*desire*... in its difference to demand: you demand something of me, but what do you really want, what are you aiming at through this demand?" (Zizek 111)

"in the last resort, what is hysteria if not precisely the effect and testimony of a failed interpellation; what is the hysterical question if not an articulation of the incapacity of the subject to fulfil the symbolic identification, to assume fully and without restraint the symbolic mandate?" (Zizek 113)

"The hysterical question opens the gap of what is 'in the subject more than the subject', of the *object in subject* which resists interpellation -- subordination of the subject, its inclusion in the symbolic network." (Zizek 113)

-- The Jew and Antigone

"fantasy is an *answer* to this *'Che vuoi?'*; it is an attempt to fill out the gap of the question with an answer." (Zizek 114)

"fantasy functions as a construction, as an imaginary scenario filling out the void, the opening of the *desire of the Other*: by giving us a definite answer to the question 'What does the Other want?', it enables us to evade the unbearable deadlock in which the Other wants something from us, but we are at the same time incapable of translating this desire of the Other into a positive interpellation, into a mandate with which to identify." (Zizek 114-15)

"is not the Jewish God the purest embodiment of this *'Che vuoi?'*, of the desire of the Other in its terrifying abyss... The basic position of a Jewish believer is, then, that of Job: not so much lamentation as incomprehension, perplexity, even horror at what the Other (God) wants with the series of calamities that are being inflicted upon him." (Zizek 115)

"in contrast to the Jewish religion of *anxiety*, Christianity is a religion of *love*.  The term 'love' is to be conceived here as articulated in Lacanian theory -- that is, in its dimension of fundamental deception: we try to fill out the unbearable gap of *'Che vuoi?'*, the opening of the Other's desire, by offering ourselves to the Other as the object of its desire." (Zizek 116)

"The operation of love is therefore double: the subject fills in his own lack by offering himself to the other as the object filling out the lack in the Other -- love's deception is that this overlapping of two lacks annuls lack as such in a mutual completion." (Zizek 116)

-- Fantasy as a Screen for the Desire of the Other

"the paradox of fantasy: it is the frame co-ordinating our desire, but at the same time a defence against *'Che vuoi?'*, a screen concealing the gap, the abyss of the desire of the Other.  Sharpening the paradox to its utmost -- to tautology -- we could say that *desire itself is a defence against desire*: the desire structured through fantasy is a defence against the desire of the Other, against this 'pure', trans-phantasmic desire (i.e., the 'death drive' in its pure form).
     We can now see why the maxim of psychoanalytic ethics as formulated by Lacan ('not to give way on one's desire') coincides with the closing moment of the psychoanalytic process, the 'going through the fantasy': the desire with regard to which we must not 'give way' is not the desire supported by fantasy but the desire of the Other beyond fantasy.  'Not to give way on desire' implies a radical renunciation of all the richness of desires based upon fantasy-scenarios." (Zizek 118)

"how does an empirical, positively given object become an object of desire; how does it begin to contain some X, some unknown quality, something which is 'in it more than it' and makes it worthy of our desire?  By entering the framework of fantasy, by being included in a fantasy-scene which gives consistency to the subject's desire." (Zizek 119)

"Here we again encounter the paradoxical intermediate role of fantasy: it is a construction enabling us to seek maternal substitutes, but at the same time a screen shielding us from getting to close to the maternal Thing -- keeping us at a distance from it." (Zizek 119-20)

"If the Name-of-the-Father functions as the agency of interpellation, of symbolic identification, the mother's desire, with its fathomless *'Che vuoi?'*, marks a certain limit at which every interpellation necessarily fails." (Zizek 121)

-- The Inconsistent Other of *Jouissance*

"The complete graph is thus divided into two levels, which can be designated as the level of meaning and the level of enjoyment.... The problem of the second (upper) level is what happens when this very field of the signifier's order, of the big Other, is perforated, penetrated by a pre-symbolic (real) stream of enjoyment -- what happens when the pre-symbolic 'substance', the body as materialized, incarnated enjoyment, becomes enmeshed in the signifier's network." (Zizek 121-22)

"as soon as the field of the signifier is penetrated by enjoyment it becomes inconsistent, porous, perforated -- the enjoyment is what cannot be symbolized, its presence in the field of the signifier can be detected only through the holes and inconsistencies of this field, so the only possibly signifier of enjoyment is the signifier of the lack in the Other, the signifier of its inconsistency." (Zizek 122)

"Today, it is a commonplace that the Lacanian subject is divided, crossed-out, identical to a lack in a signifying chain.  However, the most radical dimension of Lacanian theory lies not in recognizing this fact but in realizing that the big Other, the symbolic order itself, is also *barré*, crossed-out, by a fundamental impossibility, structured around an impossible/traumatic kernel, around a central lack." (Zizek 122)

the formula of drive as "the formula of *sinthome*: a particular signifying formation which is immediately permeated with enjoyment -- that is, the impossible junction of enjoyment with the signifier." (Zizek 123)

"Fantasy conceals the fact that the Other, the symbolic order, is structured around some traumatic impossibility, around something which cannot be symbolized -- i.e. the real of *jouissance*: through fantasy, *jouissance* is domesticated, 'gentrified' -- so what happens with desire after we 'traverse' fantasy? Lacan's answer, in the last pages of his _Seminar XI_, is *drive*, ultimately the death drive: 'beyond fantasy' there is no yearning or some kindred sublime phenomenon, 'beyond fantasy' we find only drive, its pulsation around the *sinthome*.  'Going-through-the-fantasy' is therefore strictly correlative to identification with a *sinthome*." (Zizek 123-24)

-- 'Going through' the Social Fantasy

"the crucial weakness of hitherto '(post-)structuralist' essays in the theory of ideology descending from the Althusserian theory of interpellation was to limit themselves to the lower level, to the lower square of Lacan's graph of desire -- to aim at grasping the efficiency of an ideology exclusively through the mechanisms of imaginary and symbolic identification.... 'Beyond interpellation' is the square of desire, fantasy, lack in the Other and drive pulsating around some unbearable surplus-enjoyment." (Zizek 124)

"the last support of the ideological effect (of the way an ideological network of signifiers 'holds' us) is the non-sensical, pre-ideological kernel of enjoyment." (Zizek 124)

"two complementary procedures of the 'criticism of ideology':
     -- one is *discursive*, the 'symptomal reading' of the ideological text bringing about the 'deconstruction' of the spontaneous experience of its meaning...
     -- the other aims at extracting the kernel of *enjoyment*, at articulating the way in which -- beyond the field of meaning but at the same time internal to it -- an ideology implies, manipulates, produces a pre-ideological enjoyment structured in fantasy." (Zizek 125)

"the basic trick of anti-semitism is to displace social antagonism into antagonism between the sound social texture, social body, and the Jew as the force corroding it, the force of corruption.  Thus it is not society itself which is 'impossible', based on antagonism -- the source of corruption is located in a particular entity, the Jew." (Zizek 125)

"the figure of the Jew is a symptom in the sense of a coded message, a cypher, a disfigured  representation of social antagonism; by undoing this work of displacement/condensation, we can determine its meaning.
     But the logic of metaphoric-metonymic displacement is not sufficient to explain how the figure of the Jew captures our desire; to penetrate its fascinating force, we must take into account the way 'Jew' enters the framework of a fantasy structuring our enjoyment." (Zizek 126)

"the stake of social-ideological fantasy is to construct a vision of society which *does* exist, a society which is not split by an antagonistic division, a society in which the relation between its parts is organic, complementary." (Zizek 126)

"In short, 'Jew' is a fetish which simultaneously denies and embodies the structural impossibility of 'Society': it is as if in the figure of the Jew this impossibility had acquired a positive, palpable existence -- and that is why it marks the eruption of enjoyment in the social field." (Zizek 126)

"fantasy is precisely the way the antagonistic fissure is masked.  In other words, *fantasy is a means for an ideology to take its own failure into account in advance*." (Zizek 126)

"This is why it is insufficient to designate the totalitarian project as impossible, utopian, wanting to establish a totally transparent and homogeneous society -- the problem is that in a way, totalitarian ideology *knows it*, recognizes it in advance: in the figure of the 'Jew' it includes this knowledge in its edifice... the 'Jew' is nothing but a fetishistic embodiment of a certain fundamental blockage." (Zizek 127)

"another formula of the basic procedure of the 'criticism of ideology', supplementing the one given above: to detect, in a given ideological edifice, the element which represents within it its own impossibility." (Zizek 127)

"in 'going through the fantasy' we must in the same move identify with the symptom: we must recognize in the properties attributed to 'Jew' the necessary product of our very social system; we must recognize in the 'excesses' attributed to 'Jews' the truth about ourselves." (Zizek 128)

"To 'identify with a symptom' means to recognize in the 'excesses', in the disruptions of the 'normal' way of things, the key offering us access to its true functioning." (Zizek 128)


4.  You Only Die Twice

-- Between the Two Deaths

periods of Lacan's articulation of the death drive and the signifier:  "In the first period... it is the Hegelian phenomenological idea that the word is a death, a murder of the thing: as soon as the reality is symbolized, caught in a symbolic network, the thing itself is more present in a word, in its concept, than in its immediate physical reality....
     In the second period... the accent is shifted from the word, speech, to language as a synchronic structure, a senseless autonomous mechanism which produces meaning as its effect.... The death drive is now identified with the symbolic order itself: in Lacan's own words, it is 'nothing but a mask of the symbolic order'....
     In the third period, in which the main accent of Lacan's teaching is put on the Real as impossible, the death drive again radically changes its signification... what lies beyond is not the symbolic order but a real kernel, a traumatic core... what, at this level, is the death drive? Exactly the opposite of the symbolic order: the possibility of the 'second death', the radical annihilation of the symbolic texture through which the so-called reality is constituted... not the death of the so-called 'real object' in its symbol, but the obliteration of the signifying network itself." (Zizek 131-32)

"consequences for the determination of the final moment of the psychoanalytic cure:
     In the first period... the analysis gives meaning, retroactively, to what was in the beginning a meaningless trace.  So the final moment of the analysis is reached when the subject is able to narrate to the Other his own history in its continuity; when his desire is integrated, recognized in 'full speech [*parole pleine*].
     In the second period... the final moment of analysis is reached when the subject is ready to accept this fundamental loss, to consent to symbolic castration as a price to be paid for access to his desire.
     In the third period... the final moment of the analysis is defined as 'going through the fantasy [*la traversée du fantasme*]': not its symbolic interpretation but the experience of the fact that the fantasy-object, by its fascinating presence, is merely filling out a lack, a void in the Other." (Zizek 133)

"the shift of emphasis from the symbolic to the Real." (Zizek 133)

"the distinction between the two death: because of lack of knowledge, the father in Freud's dream is still living, although he is already dead.  In a way, everybody must die twice." (Zizek 134)

"Lacan conceives this difference between the two deaths as the difference between real (biological) death and its symbolization, the 'settling of accounts', the accomplishment of symbolic destiny" (Zizek 135)

"This place 'between the two deaths', a place of sublime beauty as well as terrifying monsters, is the site of *das Ding*, of the real-traumatic kernel in the midst of symbolic order." (Zizek 135)

"The Freudian 'death drive' is nothing but the exact theoretical concept for this Sadean notion of the 'second death' -- the possibility of the total 'wipe-out' of historical tradition opened up by the very process of symbolization/historicization as its radical, self-destructive limit." (Zizek 135-36)

-- Revolution as Repetition

"By confining itself to 'the way it really was', by conceiving history as a closed, homogeneous, rectilinear, continuous course of events, the traditional historiographic gaze is a priori, formally, the gaze of 'those who have won': it sees history as a closed continuity of 'progression' leading to the reign of those who rule today.  It leaves out of consideration what *failed* in history, what has to be denied so that the continuity of 'what really happened' could establish itself." (Zizek 138)

"In contrast to the triumphal procession of victors exhibited by official historiography, the oppressed class appropriates the past to itself in so far as it is 'open', in so far as the 'yearning for redemption' is already at work in it -- that is to say, it appropriates the past in so far as the past already contains -- in the form of what failed, of what was extirpated -- the dimension of the future" (Zizek 138)

"To accomplish the appropriate of this stifled dimension of the past in so far as it already contains the future -- the future of our own revolutionary act which, by means of repetition, redeems retroactively the past... we have to cut through the continuous flow of historical development and make a 'tiger's leap into the past'" (Zizek 138-39)

"For those acquainted with the Freudian proposition that 'the unconscious is located outside time', all is actually said here: this 'filled-out time', this 'tiger's leap into the past' with which the revolutionary present is charged, announces the *compulsion to repeat*" (Zizek 140)

"contrary to the misleading first impression, the actual revolutionary situation is *not* a kind of 'return of the repressed' -- rather, the returns of the repressed, the 'symptoms', are past failed revolutionary attempts, forgotten, excluded from the frame of the reigning historical tradition, whereas the actual revolutionary situation presents an attempt to 'unfold the symptom, to 'redeem' -- that is, realize in the Symbolic -- these past failed attempts which 'will have been' only through their repetition, at which point they become retroactively what they already were." (Zizek 141)

-- The 'Perspective of the Last Judgement'

"Actual history occurs, so to speak, on credit; only subsequent development will decide retroactively if the current revolutionary violence will be forgiven, legitimated, or if it will continue to exert a pressure on the shoulders of the present generation as its guilt, as its unsettled debt." (Zizek 142)

"In this sense, revolution is strictly a *creationist* act, a radical intrusion of the 'death drive': erasure of the reigning Text, creation *ex nihilo* of a new Text by means of which the stifled past 'will have been'." (Zizek 143-44)

"The fantasy which serves as a support for the figure of the Stalinist Communist is therefore exactly the same as the fantasy which is at work in the Tom and Jerry cartoons: behind the figure of the indestructibility and invincibility of the Communist who can endure even the most terrible ordeal and survive it intact, reinforced with new strength, there is the same fantasy logic as that of a cat whose head is blown up by dynamite and who, in the next scene, proceeds intact his pursuit of his class enemy, the mouse." (Zizek 145)

-- From the Master to the Leader

"we, the subjects, think that we treat the king as a king because he is in himself a king, but in reality a king is a king because we treat him like one.  And this fact that the charismatic power of a king is an effect of the symbolic ritual performed by his subjects much remain hidden: as subjects, we are necessarily victims of the illusion that the king is already in himself a king." (Zizek 146)

"it is as if the totalitarian Leader is addressing his subjects and legitimizing his power precisely by referring to the above-mentioned Pascalian-Marxian argument -- that is, revealing to them the secret of the classical Master; basically, he is saying to them: 'I'm your Master because you treat me as your Master; it is you, with your activity, who make me your Master!'" (Zizek 146)

"The Lacanian definition of democracy would then be: a sociopolitical order in which the People do not exist -- do not exist as a unity, embodied in their unique representative.  That is why the basic feature of the democratic order is that the place of Power is, by the necessity of its structure, an empty place.  In a democratic order, sovereignty lies in the People -- but what is the People if not, precisely, the collection of the *subject* of power?" (Zizek 147)

"'democratic society' could be determined as a society whose institutional structure includes, as a part of its 'normal', 'regular' reproduction, the moment of dissolution of the socio-symbolic bond, the moment of irruption of the Real: elections.  Lefort interprets elections (those of 'formal', 'bourgeois' democracy) as an act of symbolic dissolution of social edifice: their crucial feature is the one that is usually made the target for Marxist criticism of 'formal democracy' -- the fact that we take part as abstract citizens, atomized individuals, reduced to pure Ones without further qualifications." (Zizek 147-48)

"In vain do we conceal this thoroughly 'irrational' character of what we call 'formal democracy': at the moment of an election, the society is delivered to a stochastic process.  Only the acceptance of such a risk, only such a readiness to hand over one's fate to 'irrational' hazard, renders 'democracy' possible" (Zizek 148)

"It is true that democracy makes possible all sorts of manipulation, corruption, the rule of demagogy, and so on, but as soon as we eliminate the possibility of such deformations, we lose democracy itself" (Zizek 148)

"So although 'in reality' there are only 'exceptions' and 'deformations', the universal notion of 'democracy' is none the less a 'necessary fiction', a symbolic fact in the absence of which effective democracy, in all the plurality of its forms, could not reproduce itself." (Zizek 148-49)


Part III: The Subject

5.  Which Subject of the Real?

-- 'There is no Metalanguage'

"In comprehending Lacan as 'post-structuralist', one usually overlooks the radical break that separates him from the field of 'post-structuralism'" (Zizek 153)

"Post-structuralism claims that a text is always 'framed' by its own commentary: the interpretation of a literary text resides on the same plane as its 'object'.  Thus, the interpretation is included in the literary corpus: there is no 'pure' literary object that would not contain an element of interpretation, of distance towards its immediate meaning.... That is why the post-structuralist procedure *par excellence* is not only to search in purely literary texts for propositions containing a theory about their own functioning but also to read theoretical texts themselves as 'literature' -- more precisely, to put in parentheses their claim to truth in order to expose the textual mechanisms producing the 'truth effect'." (Zizek 153)

"Lacan always insists on psychoanalysis as a truth-experience: his thesis that truth is structured like a fiction has nothing at all to do with a post-structuralist reduction of the truth-dimension to a textual 'truth-effect'." (Zizek 154)

"the position from which the deconstructivist can always make sure of the fact that 'there is no metalanguage'; that no utterance can say precisely what it intended to say; that the process of enunciation always subverts the utterance; is *the position of metalanguage* in its purest, most radical form." (Zizek 154-55)

"The whole effort to write 'poetically', to make us feel how our own text is already caught in a decentred network of plural processes and how this textual process always subverts what we 'intended to say', the whole effort to evade the purely theoretical form of exposing our ideas and to adopt rhetorical devices usually reserved to literature, masks the annoying fact that at the root of what post-structuralists are saying there is a clearly defined theoretical position which can be articulated without difficulty in a pure and simply metalanguage." (Zizek 155)

-- The Phallic Signifier

"In the Lacanian perspective it is, on the contrary, precisely such 'impossible' utterances -- utterances following the logic of the paradox 'I am lying' -- which keep the fundamental gap of the signifying process open and in this way prevent us from assuming a metalanguage position." (Zizek 156)

"Metalanguage is not just an Imaginary entity.  It is *Real* in the strict Lacanian sense -- that is, it is impossible to *occupy* its position.  But, Lacan adds, it is even more difficult simply to *avoid* it.  One cannot *attain* it, but one also cannot *escape* it.  That is why the only way to avoid the Real is to produce an utterance of pure metalanguage which, by its patent absurdity, materializes its own impossibility" (Zizek 156)

"The phallic signifier is, so to speak, an index of its own impossibility.  In its very positivity it is the signifier of 'castration' -- that is, of its own lack." (Zizek 157)

-- 'Lenin in Warsaw' as Object

"In Lacan's teaching, however, the proposition 'there is no metalanguage' is to be taken literally.  It means that all language is in a way an object-language: *there is no language without object*." (Zizek 158)

"'Lenin in Warsaw' is, in a strict Lacanian sense, the object of this picture.  The title names the object which is lacking in the field of what is depicted.  That is to say, in this joke, the trap in which the visitor was caught could be defined precisely as the metalanguage trap.  The visitor's mistake is to establish the same distance between the picture and the title as between the sign and the denoted object, as if the title is speaking *about* the picture from a kind of 'objective distance', and then to look for its positive correspondence in the picture." (Zizek 159)

"The misunderstanding in the post-structuralist criticism of Lacan is ultimately a misunderstanding about the nature of the *Vorstellungsrepräsentanz*.  This criticism misses the fact that the *Vorstellungsrepräsentanz* (the pure, reflexive signifier incarnating the lack itself) fills out the void of the lost object.  As soon as the *Vorstellungsrepräsentanz* is no longer connected to this hole in the Other, to the falling out of the object, it begins to function as a 'title': as a metalanguage designation, as an incision that limits, totalizes, canalizes the original dispersion of the signifying texture... in short, we find ourselves in a 'post-structuralist' mess." (Zizek 160)

-- Antagonism as Real

"the paradoxical character of the Lacanian Real.  It is usually conceived as a hard kernel resisting symbolization, dialecticization, persisting in its place, always returning to it." (Zizek 161)

"But this is just one side of the Lacanian Real; it is the side which predominates in the fifties when we have the *Real* -- the brute, presymbolic reality which always returns to its place -- then the *symbolic* order which structures our perception of reality, and finally the *Imaginary*, the level of illusory entities whose consistency is the effect of a kind of mirror-play -- that is, they have no real existence but are a mere structural effect.  With the development of Lacanian teaching in the sixties and seventies, what he calls 'the Real' approaches more and more what he called, in the fifties, the Imaginary." (Zizek 162)

"The Real is an entity which must be constructed afterwards so that we can account for the distortions of the symbolic structure." (Zizek 162)

"The paradox of the Lacanian Real, then, is that it is an entity which, although it does not exist (in the sense of 'really existing', taking place in reality), has a series of properties -- it exercises a certain structural causality, it can produce a series of effects in the symbolic reality of subjects." (Zizek 163)

an example: "the famous MacGuffin, the Hitchcockian object, the pure pretext whose sole role is to set the story in motion but which is in itself 'nothing at all' -- the only significance of the MacGuffin lies in the fact that it has some significance for the characters -- that it must be of vital importance to them... that's MacGuffin, a pure nothing which is none the less efficient.  Needless to add, the MacGuffin is the purest case of what Lacan calls *objet petit a*: a pure void which functions as the object-cause of desire." (Zizek 163)

"That would be, then, the precise definition of the real object: a cause which in itself does not exist -- which is present only in a series of effects, but always in a distorted, displaced way." (Zizek 163)

"If we define the Real as such a paradoxical, chimerical entity which, although it does not exist, has a series of properties and can produce a series of effects, it becomes clear that the Real *par excellence* is *jouissance*: *jouissance* does not exist, it is impossible, but it produces a number of traumatic effects.  This paradoxical nature of *jouissance* also offers us a clue to explaining the fundamental paradox which unfailingly attests the presence of the Real: the fact of the prohibition of something which is already in itself impossible." (Zizek 164)

-- The Forced Choice of Freedom

"In the subject's relationship to the community to which he belongs, there is always such a paradoxical point of *choix forcé* -- at this point, the community is saying to the subject: you have freedom to choose, but on condition that you choose the right thing... If you make the wrong choice, you lose freedom of choice itself... the situation of the forced choice consists in the fact that the subject must freely choose the community to which he already belongs, independent of his choice -- *he must choose what is already given to him*." (Zizek 165)

"The paradox of love is that it is a free choice, but a choice which never arrives in the present -- it is always already made.  At a certain moment, I can only state retroactively that *I've already chosen*." (Zizek 166)

"Is it necessary to point out how this Schellingian determination of an original, atemporal choice corresponds perfectly to the Lacanian notion of the Real as an act which never took place in reality but which must nevertheless be presupposed, 'constructed', afterward to account for the present state of things?" (Zizek 168-69)

-- *Coincidentia Oppositorum*

"The Real is therefore simultaneously both the hard, impenetrable kernel resisting symbolization *and* a pure chimerical entity which has in itself no ontological consistency." (Zizek 169)

"the notion of traumatic event: a point of failure of symbolization, but at the same time never given in its positivity -- it can be constructed only backwards, from its structural effects.  All its effectivity lies in the distortions it produces in the symbolic universe of the subject: the traumatic event is ultimately just a fantasy-construct filling out a certain void in a symbolic structure and, as such, the retroactive effect of this structure." (Zizek 169)

"the Real which in a sense *precedes* the symbolic order and is subsequently structured by it when it gets caught in its network: this is the great Lacanian motif of symbolization as a process which mortifies, drains off, empties, carves the fullness of the Real of the living body.  But the Real is at the same time the product, remainder, leftover, scraps of this process of symbolization, the remnants, the excess which escapes symbolization and is as such produced by the symbolization itself.... In so far as the kernel of the Real is *jouissance*, this duality takes the form of a difference between *jouissance*, enjoyment, and *plus-de-jouir*, the surplus-of-enjoying: *jouissance* is the basis upon which symbolization works, the basis emptied, disembodied, structured by the symbolization, but this process produces at the same time a residue, a leftover, which is the surplus-enjoyment." (Zizek 169-70)

"The Real is the fullness of the inert presence, positivity; nothing is lacking in the Real -- that is, the lack is introduced only by the symbolization; it is a signifier which introduces a void, an absence in the Real.  But at the same time the Real is in itself a hole, a gap, an opening in the middle of the symbolic order -- it is the lack around which the symbolic order is structured." (Zizek 170)

"the Real is something that cannot be negated, a positive inert datum which is insensitive to negation, cannot be caught in the dialectics of negativity; but we must add at once that it is so because the Real itself, in its positivity, is nothing but an embodiment of a certain void, lack, radical negativity.  *It cannot be negated because it is already in itself, in its positivity, nothing but an embodiment of a pure negativity, emptiness.*" (Zizek 170)

"We can thus differentiate between the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real status of the couples of opposites.  In the *imaginary* relation, the two poles of opposition are complementary; together they build a harmonious totality; each gives the other what the other lacks -- each fills out the lack in the other (the fantasy of the fully realized sexual relationship, for example, where man and woman form a harmonious whole).  The *symbolic* relation is, on the contrary, differential: the identity of each of the moments consists in its difference to the opposite moment.  A given element does not fill in the lack in the other, it is not complementary to the other but, on the contrary, *takes the place of the lack in the other*, embodies what is lacking in the other: its positive presence is nothing but an objectification of a lack in its opposite element.... Finally, the *Real* is defined as a point of the immediate coincidence of the opposite poles: each pole passes immediately into its opposite; each is already in itself its own opposite." (Zizek 171-72)

"The Real is of course, in a first approach, that which cannot be inscribed, which 'doesn't cease not to inscribe itself...' -- the rock upon which every formalization stumbles.  But it is precisely through this failure that we can in a way encircle, locate the empty place of the Real.  In other words, the Real cannot be inscribed, but we can inscribe this impossibility itself, we can locate its place: a traumatic place which causes a series of failures.  And Lacan's whole point is that the Real is *nothing but* this impossibility of its inscription: the Real is not a transcendent positive entity, persisting somewhere beyond the symbolic order like a hard kernel inaccessible to it, some kind of Kantian 'Thing-in-itself' -- in itself it is nothing at all, just a void, an emptiness in a symbolic structure marking some central impossibility." (Zizek 172-73)

-- Another Hegelian Joke

"The basic feature of the Lacanian subject is, of course, its alienation in the signifier: as soon as the subject is caught in the radically external signifying network he is mortified, dismembered, divided." (Zizek 173)

"the whole Lacanian problem of the reflexivity of desire: desire is always a desire of a desire -- the question is not immediately 'What should I desire?' but 'There are a lot of things that I desire, I have a lot of desires -- which of them is worth being the object of my desire? Which desire should I desire?" (Zizek 174)

"Here, however, we must distinguish carefully between this Lacanian notion of the divided subject and the 'post-structuralist' notion of the subject-positions.  In 'post-structuralism', the subject is usually reduced to so-called subjectivation, he is conceived as an effect of a fundamentally non-subjective process: the subject is always caught in, traversed by the pre-subjective process (of 'writing', of 'desire' and so on), and the emphasis is on the individuals' different modes of 'experiencing', 'living' their positions as 'subjects', 'actors', 'agents' of the historical process.... The great master of such analysis was, of course, Foucault: one might say that the main point of his late work was to articulate the different modes by which individual assume their subject-positions.
     But with Lacan, we have quite another notion of the subject.  To put it simply: if we make an abstraction, if we subtract all the richness of the different modes of subjectivation, all the fullness of experience present in the way the individuals are 'living' their subject-positions, what remains is an empty place which was filled out with this richness; this original void, this lack of symbolic structure, *is* the subject, the subject of the signifier.  The *subject* is therefore to be strictly opposed to the effect of *subjectivation*: what the subjectivation masks is not a pre- or trans-subjective process of writing but a lack in the structure, a lack which is the subject." (Zizek 174-75)

"Lacan's starting point is, of course, that symbolic representation always distorts the subject, that is is always a displacement, a failure -- that the subject cannot find a signifier which would be 'his own', that he is always saying too little or too much: in short, *something other* than what he wanted or intended to say." (Zizek 175)

"The Lacanian thesis is the opposite: this surplus of signification masks a fundamental lack.  The subject of the signifier is precisely this lack, this impossibility of finding a signifier which would be 'its own': *the failure of its representation is its positive condition*.... To put it paradoxically: the subject of the signifier is a retroactive effect of the failure of its own representation; that is why the failure of representation is the only way to represent it adequately." (Zizek 175)

"This is also, in a nutshell, the logic of the 'negation of the negation': this double, self-referential negation does not entail any kind of return to positive identity, any kind of abolition, of cancellation of the disruptive force of negativity, of reducing it to a passing moment in the self-mediating process of identity; in the 'negation of the negation', the negativity preserves all its disruptive power; the whole point is just that we come to experience how this negative, disruptive power, menacing our identity is simultaneously a positive condition of it." (Zizek 176)

"the 'negation of the negation' does not bring us the final answer filling out the void of all questions: it is to be conceived more like a paradoxical twist whereby *the question itself begins to function as its own answer*" (Zizek 177)

-- Subject as an 'Answer of the Real'

"What, then, is the status of this subject before subjectivation?  The Lacanian answer would be, roughly speaking, that before subjectivation as identification, before ideological interpellation, before assuming a certain subject-position, the subject is the subject of a question... the subject is not a question, it is as an *answer*, the answer of the Real to the question asked by the big Other, the symbolic order... It is not the subject which is asking the question; the subject is the void of the impossibility of answering the question of the Other." (Zizek 178)

"The basic indecency of the question consists in its drive to put into words what should be left unspoken... It aims at a point at which the answer is not possible, where the word is lacking, where the subject is exposed in his impotence." (Zizek 179)

"A question, even if it refers only to a given state of things, always makes the subject formally responsible for it, although only in a negative way -- responsible, that is, for his impotence in the face of this fact." (Zizek 180)

"Our thesis is that it is precisely the question in its obscene dimension, in so far as it aims at the ex-timate kernel, at what is in the subject more than subject, at the *object in subject* which is constitutive for the subject.  In other words there is no subject without guilt, the subject exists only in so far as he is ashamed because of the object in himself, in its interior." (Zizek 180)

"the subject is an answer of the Real (of the object, of the traumatic kernel) to the question of the Other.  The question as such produces in its addressee an effect of shame and guilt, it divides, it hystericizes him, and this hysterization is the constitution of the subject: the status of the subject as such is hysterical." (Zizek 180-81)

-- S(/A), *a*, /O

three types of objects: "First, then, the MacGuffin itself, 'nothing at all', an empty place, a pure pretext for setting the action in motion... But in a series of Hitchcock's films, we find another type of object which is decidedly *not* indifferent, *not* pure absence: what matters here is precisely its present, the material presence of a fragment of reality -- it is a leftover, remnants which cannot be reduced to a network of formal relations proper to the symbolic structure, but it is paradoxically, at the same time, the positive condition for the effectuation of the formal structure.  We can define this object as an object of exchange circulating among subjects, serving as a kind of guarantee, pawn, on their symbolic relationship." (Zizek 182)

"That is why Hitchcock (and with him Lacan) is no longer a 'structuralist': the basic gesture of 'structuralism' is to reduce the imaginary richness to a formal network of symbolic relations: what escapes the structuralist perspective is that this formal structure is itself tied by an umbilical cord to some radically contingent material element which, in its pure particularity, 'is' a structure, embodies it.  Why?  Because the big Other, the symbolic order, is always *barré*, failed, crossed-out, mutilated, and the contingent material element embodies this internal blockage, limit, of the symbolic structure." (Zizek 183)

"Finally, we have a third kind of object: the birds in _The Birds_, for example... This object has a massive, oppressive material presence; it is not an indifferent void like the MacGuffin, but at the same time it does not circulate between the subjects, it is not an object of exchange, it is just a mute embodiment of an impossible *jouissance*" (Zizek 184)

so the MacGuffin is the *object petit a*; the birds are /O (actually a phi?); the circulating object of exchange is S(/A)

-- The Subject Presumed To...

"the logic of the 'subject presumed to know' which Lacan isolated as the central axis, anchor, of the phenomenon of transference: the analyst is presumed to know in advance -- what? -- the meaning of the analysand's symptoms.  This knowledge is of course an illusion, but it is a necessary one: in the end only through this supposition of knowledge, can some real knowledge can [sic] be produced." (Zizek 185)

the "*subject presumed to believe*... The crucial point is that this other presumed to believe naively does not have to exist effectively: to produce his effects in reality, it is enough that he is presumed by others to exist." (Zizek 185)

"While in Freudian analysis the analyst plays the role of the subject presumed to know, in the revisionist tradition his role is closer to that of the subject presumed to believe" (Zizek 186)

"The second concept in this series would be the *subject presumed to enjoy*... for the obsessional neurotic the traumatic point is the supposed existence, in the other, of an insupportable, limitless, horrifying *jouissance*; the stake of all his frantic activity is to protect, to save the Other from his *jouissance*, even at the price of destroying him or her" (Zizek 186-87)

"The last concept would be, of course, that of the *subject presumed to desire*.... The problem for the hysterical subject is that he always needs to have recourse to another subject to organize his desire -- that is the meaning of the Lacanian formula that hysterical desire is the desire of the other." (Zizek 187)

-- The Presumed Knowledge

"the four subjects presumed to... are not on the same level: the subject presumed to know is their basis, their matrix, and the function of the remaining three is precisely to disguise its troubling framework." (Zizek 187, ellipsis in original)

"one of the most subversive features of Mozart's operas consists precisely in the adroit manipulation of the gap between form and content, where it is the form which articulates the 'repressed' truth of the content" (Zizek 188)

"In Mozart, we still have the 'unconscious' as the network of external, 'non-psychological' symbolic relations which decide on the 'truth' of the subjects caught in it: in the very restraining, holding back, in preventing the subjective-psychological content from 'expressing' itself too strongly in the form, to permeate the form too directly -- in this very keeping the content at a distance from the form -- the 'repressed' truth of the content finds room to articulate itself.  We enter the 'romantic' mode the moment the external, 'mechanical' form is experienced as 'mere form', for without its own content" (Zizek 189)

-- 'The fear of error is... the error itself'

"Contrary to the usual parallel between Kant-Mozart on one side and Hegel-Beethoven on the other, we should stress that *here Hegel is Mozartian*" (Zizek 190)

"This, of course, introduces a dialectical relation between Truth and appearance: 'Truth' is definitely not a kind of surplus *eluding* us again and again; it appears, on the contrary, in the form of traumatic *encounters* -- that is, we chance upon it where we presumed in the presence of 'mere appearance': the 'shock of the truth' consists in its sudden emergence in the the [sic] midst of the realm of reassuring phenomena." (Zizek 190)

Kant's "'transcendental' procedure of limiting our possible experience to the world of phenomena and of excluding from it the 'Thing-in-itself' apparently expresses an aspiration to truth -- the fear of falling into error by illegitimately taking phenomena for the Thing-in-itself.  However, as Hegel puts it, this fear of error, of a confusion between phenomena and the Thing-in-itself, conceals its opposite, the fear of the Truth -- it announces a desire to elude, at any price, an encounter with the Truth" (Zizek 190)

"We can now see, what Lacan is aiming at when he says that 'the Truth has the structure of a fiction'.  This is clear from the Lacanian matrix of the four discourses: 'Truth' is an empty *place*, and the 'effect of Truth' is produced when, quite by chance, some piece of 'fiction' (of symbolically structured knowledge) finds itself occupying this place" (Zizek 191)

"hysteria and obsessional neurosis are not two species of neurosis as a neutral-universal genus; their relation is a dialectical one" (Zizek 191)

-- 'The supersensible is therefore appearance *qua* appearance'

"The appearance implies that there is something behind it which appears through it; it conceals a truth and by the same gesture gives a foreboding thereof; it simultaneously hides and reveals the essence behind the curtain.  But what is hidden behind the phenomenal appearance? Precisely the fact that there is nothing to hide.  What is concealed is that the very act of concealing conceals nothing." (Zizek 193)

"If, behind the phenomenal veil, there is nothing, it is through the mediation of this 'nothing' that the subject constitutes himself in the very act of his misrecognition.  The illusion that there is something hidden behind the curtain is thus a reflexive one: what is hidden behind the appearance is the possibility of this very illusion -- behind the curtain is the fact that the subject thinks something must be behind it." (Zizek 193)

"We must remember that there is nothing intrinsically sublime in a sublime object -- according to Lacan, a sublime object is an ordinary, everyday object which, quite by chance, finds itself occupying the place of what he calls *das Ding*, the impossible-real object of desire.... It is its structural place -- the fact that it occupies the sacred/forbidden place of *jouissance* -- and not its intrinsic qualities that confers on it its sublimity." (Zizek 194)

"what Lacan calls 'going-through the fantasy' consists precisely in the experience of such an inversion apropos of the fantasy-object: the subject must undergo the experience of how the ever-lacking object-cause of desire is in itself nothing but an objectification, an embodiment of a certain lack" (Zizek 195)

"if we subtract form the illusion the illusion itself (its positive content) what remains is not simply nothing but a determinate nothing, the void in the structure which opened the space for the 'illusion'.  To 'unmask the illusion' does not mean that 'there is nothing to see behind it': what we must be able to see is precisely this *nothing as such*" (Zizek 195)

"to 'experience the substance as subject' means to grasp that the curtain of phenomena conceals above all the fact that there is nothing to conceal, and this 'nothing' behind the curtain is the subject." (Zizek 196)

"It conceals the fact that there is nothing to conceal: it does not feign to tell the truth when it is lying, it feigns to lie when it is actually telling the truth -- that is, it deceives by pretending to deceive." (Zizek 196-97)

"This appearance is *essential*: if it were to be destroyed -- if somebody were *publicly* to pronounce the obvious truth that 'the emperor is naked' (that nobody takes the ruling ideology seriously...) -- in a sense the whole system would fall apart: why? In other words, if everybody knows that 'the emperor is naked' and if everybody knows that all the others know it, what is the agency for the sake of which the appearance is to be kept at any price?  There is, of course, only one consistent answer: *the big Other* -- it is the big Other which should be maintained in ignorance." (Zizek 198)


6.  'Not Only as *Substance*, but Also as *Subject*'

-- The Logic of Sublimity

relationship of Beauty and Sublimity: "Above all, however, Beauty and Sublimity are opposed along the axis pleasure-displeasure: a view of Beauty offers us pleasure, while 'the object is received as sublime with a pleasure that is only possible through the mediation of displeasure' (Kate, 1964, p. 109).  In short, the Sublime is 'beyond the pleasure principle', it is a paradoxical pleasure procured by displeasure itself (the exact definition -- one of the Lacanian definitions -- of enjoyment [*jouissance*])." (Zizek 202)

"This is also why an object evoking in us the feeling of Sublimity gives us simultaneous pleasure and displeasure: it gives us displeasure because of its inadequacy to the Thing-Idea, but precisely through this inadequacy it gives us pleasure by indicating the true, incomparable greatness of the Thing, surpassing every possible phenomenal, empirical experience" (Zizek 203)

"The Sublime is therefore the paradox of an object which, in the very field of representation, provides a view, in a negative way, of the dimension of what is unrepresentable." (Zizek 203)

"the limit of the logic of representation is not to 'reduce all contents to representations', to what can be represented, but, on the contrary, in the very presupposition of some positive entity (Thing-in-itself) *beyond phenomenal representation*.  We overcome phenomenality not by reaching beyond it, but by the experience of how there is nothing beyond it -- how its beyond is precisely this Nothing of absolute negativity, of the utmost inadequacy of the appearance to its notion." (Zizek 206)

"the Sublime is no longer an (empirical) object indicating through its very inadequacy the dimension of a transcendent Thing-in-itself (Idea) but an object which occupies the place, replaces, fills out the empty place of the Thing as the void, as the pure Nothing of absolute negativity -- the Sublime is an object whose positive body is just an embodiment of Nothing." (Zizek 206)

-- 'The Spirit is a Bone'

"*this negativity, this unbearable discord, coincides with subjectivity itself*, it is the only way to make present and 'palpable' the utmost -- that is, self-referential -- negativity which characterizes the spiritual subjectivity." (Zizek 207)

"Does not the proposition 'the Spirit is a bone' -- this equation of two absolutely incompatible terms, pure negative movement of the subject and the total inertia of a rigid object -- offer us something like a Hegelian version of the Lacanian formula of fantasy...?" (Zizek 208)

-- 'Wealth is the Self'

"This is why 'flattery' is not to be conceived at the psychological level, in the sense of hypocritical and avaricious adulation: what announces itself here is rather the dimension of an *alienation proper to language as such* -- it is the very form of language which introduces a radical alienation; noble-minded consciousness betrays the sincerity of its internal conviction *as soon as it starts talking*."  (Zizek 211)

"the 'truth' of what we are saying depends on the way our speech constitutes a social bond, on its performative function, not on the psychological 'sincerity' of our intention." (Zizek 211)

"This is how 'flattering the Monarch against one's convictions'  can become an ethical act: by pronouncing empty phrases which disavow our innermost convictions, we submit ourselves to a compulsive disrupting of our narcissistic homeostasis, we 'externalize' ourselves completely -- we heroically renounce what is most precious in us, our 'sense of honour', our moral consistency, our self-respect." (Zizek 211)

"Where can the subject who is thus 'emptied' find his objective correlative?  The Hegelian answer is: in Wealth, in money obtained in exchange for flattery.  The proposition 'Wealth is the Self' repeats as this level the proposition 'The Spirit is a bone': in both cases we are dealing with a proposition which is at first sign absurd, nonsensical, with an equation the terms of which are incompatible; in both cases we encounter the same logical structure of passage: the subject, totally lost in the medium of language (language of gestures and grimaces; language of flattery), finds his objective counterpart in the inertia of a non-language object (skull, money)." (Zizek 212)

-- Positing, External, Determinate Reflection

"To exemplify this movement of reflection -- namely the triad of positing, external and determinate reflection (Hegel, 1966), let us take the eternal hermeneutical question of how to read a text.  'Positing reflection' corresponds to a naïve reading claiming immediate access to the true meaning of the text: we know, we pretend to grasp immediately what a text says.  The problem arises, of course, when there are a number of mutually exclusive readings claiming access to the true meaning: how do we choose between them, how do we judge their claims? 'External reflection' provides a way out of this impasse: it transposes the 'essence', the 'true meaning' of a text into the unattainable beyond, making of it a transcendent 'Thing-in-itself'.  All that is accessible to us, finite subjects, are distorted reflections, partial aspects deformed by our subjective perspective; the Truth-in-itself, the true meaning of the text, is lost for ever.
     All we have to do to pass from 'external' to 'determinate' reflection is to become aware how *this very externality of the external reflexive determinations of the 'essence'* (the series of distorted, partial reflections of the true meaning of the text) *is already internal to this 'essence' itself*, how the internal 'essence' is already in itself 'decentred', how the 'essence' of this essence itself consists in this series of external determinations." (Zizek 213)

"The 'true' meaning of _Antigone_ is not to be sought in the obscure origins of what 'Sophocles really wanted to say', it is constituted by this very series of subsequent readings -- that is, it is constituted *afterwards*, through a certain structurally necessary *delay*." (Zizek 214)

"it is not only that the appearance, the fissure between appearance and essence, is a fissure internal to the essence itself; the crucial point is that, inversely, *'essence' itself is nothing but the self-rupture, the self-fissure of the appearance*.
     In other words, the fissure between appearance and essence is internal to the appearance itself; it must be reflected in the very domain of appearance" (Zizek 214)

-- Positing the Presuppositions

"This, then, is Hegel's fundamental lesson: when we are active, when we intervene in the world through a particular act, the real act is not this particular, empirical, factual intervention (or non-intervention); the real act is of a strictly symbolic nature, it consists in the very mode in which we structure the world, our perception of it, in advance, in order to make our intervention possible, in order to open in it the space for our activity (or inactivity).  The real act thus *precedes* the (particular-factual) activity; it consists in the previous restructuring of our symbolic universe into which our (factual, particular) act will be inscribed." (Zizek 215-16)

"the subject of course presupposes the 'world', the objectivity on which he performs his activity, as something given in advance, as a positive condition of his activity; but his positive-empirical activity is possible only if he structures his perception of the world in advance in a way that opens the space for his intervention -- in other words, only if he retroactively posits the very presuppositions of his activity, of his 'positing.'" (Zizek 218)

"'Culture' consists not only in transforming nature, in conferring on it spiritual form: human nature itself, as soon as it is put in relation to culture, *changes into its own opposite* -- what was a moment ago spontaneous innocence becomes retroactively pure Evil." (Zizek 219)

"*This is the way 'substance becomes subject'*: when, by means of an empty gesture, the subject takes upon himself the leftover which eludes his active intervention.  This 'empty gesture' receives from Lacan its proper name: the signifier; in it resides the elementary, constitutive act of symbolization." (Zizek 221)

"'phallus' designates the juncture at which the radical externality of the body as independent of our will, as resisting our will, joins the pure interiority of our thought. 'Phallus' is the signifier of the short circuit whereby the uncontrollable externality of the body passes immediately into something bound to pure interiority of 'thought' and, in contrast, the point at which the innermost 'thought' assumes features of some strange entity, escaping our 'free will'." (Zizek 223)

"from this notion of the phallus as pulsation between 'all' and 'nothing' -- we can conceive the 'phallic' dimension of the act of formal conversion of reality *as given* into reality *as posited*.  This act is 'phallic' in so far as it marks the point of coincidence between omnipotence ('everything depends on me': the subject posits all reality as his work) and total impotence ('but for all that I can do nothing': the subject can formally assume only what is given to him)." (Zizek 223)

-- Presupposing the Positing

"This positing of presuppositions is already contained in the logic of positing reflection; what defines determinate reflection is, rather, that the subject must *presuppose himself as positing*.  More precisely: the subject effectively 'posits his presuppositions' by presupposing, by reflecting himself in them as positing." (Zizek 229)

"From this dialectic, we can very neatly deduce the necessity behind the double meaning of the word 'subject' -- (1) a person subject to political rule; (2) a free agent, instigator of its activity -- subjects can realize themselves as free agents only by means of redoubling themselves, only in so far as they 'project', transpose, the pure form of their freedom into the very heart of the substance opposed to them; into the person of the subject-Monarch as 'head of State'." (Zizek 229)

"the condition of our subjective freedom, of our 'positing', is that it must be reflected in advance into the substance itself, as its own 'reflexive determination'." (Zizek 230)
