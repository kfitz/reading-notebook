Introduction: French Cathedrals and Other Forms of Life

begins with Henry Adams's sense of his affair with cathedrals; later sense of "disenchantment" of the world as the "vis nova" (or dynamism) strips the world of its magic

"From this anxiety that his beliefs may be a mere tissue of fictions arises the famous third-person voice of Adams's narrative." (Chodat 4)

"The starting point of this book is that writers of the last century have most typically resembled not the Adams who fears the gradual evaporation of minds in modernity, but rather the earlier, lovestruck Adams who feels the intentional 'force' of the cathedrals 'to the last fibre of his being.'  Like Adams, modern and contemporary writers have treated a startling range of entities as sentient speakers and actors.  Future generations, I'll be arguing, will see the last century's literature not as exhibiting the dissolution of agency, but the gradual displacement of it onto new and varied forms." (Chodat 4)

deep suspicion about agency in the twentieth century -- representations of the agency of the inanimate in fiction; antihumanist strands in contemporary philosophy; scientific research in artificial intelligence and cognitive science

exploration of objects (like cathedrals and novels) that are somehow manifestations of mind

"Unlike most philosophical theories, modern and contemporary literary texts, at least in some of the most powerful and compelling cases, do not assume that we know which things count as sentient forms of life, and which forms of life can perform which actions." (Chodat 10)

"My discussions trace the interaction of two broad ideas of agency to which twentieth-century texts drift.  The first is what Ill be referring to as 'persons.'  'Person' is a term seldom mentioned in recent literary studies.... As I'll be using it here, 'person' is best defined in contrast tot he term that Descartes made famous (and that *is* mentioned in much literary studies), namely, the 'subject.'" (Chodat 11)

"the term 'person,' unlike 'subject,' refers to material bodies.  The 'it' that 'thinks' in Descartes lacks extension; it cannot be located in space.  But a 'person,' like a pear or porcelain vase, is something that one can point to, push, or pick up.  To call something a *person* is to underscore this embodied condition -- unlike *human being*, which suggests a generalized membership in a species, or *individual*, which suggests an existence abstracted from a social order and history." (Chodat 12)

"If 'person' is one pole to which ideas of agency have drifted, the other is what I'll be calling 'presence.' 'Presence' here is not used in the various senses most familiar to literary theory, where it usually means something akin to 'immediacy' or 'direct contact,' but in the more commonplace sense of an immaterial entity -- as in a ghost or apparition." (Chodat 15)

"Note immediately that, although 'presence' designates no spatial properties and performs no worldly acts, it does designate a sentient thing and purposive being." (Chodat 15)


Part I: Agents Within

1.  Sense, Science and Slight Contacts with Other People's Minds

Gertrude Stein, "If I Told Him: A Completed Portrait of Picasso"

Stein's commitment to the scientific: relationship between perception and existence; subjective experience becomes as objective as the empirical

"Literary texts, I will argue, are hard to describe in scientific terms because they are both the product of an intentional action and essentially concerned with intentional action.  This doesn't mean that agency is a supernatural phenomenon, but it does mean that the language of action and the language of science are like oil and water." (Chodat 38)

"Science is 'scientific' on account of what is sometimes called its 'nomological' character: where there is causality, there is causal law, i.e., a hypothetically assumed general statement under which individual cases can be subsumed." (Chodat 39-40)

"Both reasons and causes are offered to explain the behavior of an entity, but unlike causal explanation, justification by reasons involves attributing the intentional states of our folk psychology:  beliefs, desires, wishes, hopes, hatreds, and so on." (Chodat 41)

"One way of defining an 'agent' is to say that it is the sort of entity whose behavior is efficiently and effectively captured in such reason-giving terms." (Chodat 42)

nomology (movement) v. agency (action)

"You have slight contacts with other people's minds, but you cannot enter into them." (Stein, qtd on Chodat 44)

introspection: agency should be identified with "inside," disembodied entity (presence) which is responsible for the existence of the text

"Whereas in ELiot or Pound the text typically loses sense *between* sentences, the sense in Stein's work is lost *within* sentences -- to the point that 'sentence' is no longer even the appropriate term to apply to her chains of words." (Chodat 50)

"When, that is, we move away from the question of how we are supposed to understand her texts in theory to the question of how readers have actually grappled with them in practice, we find that introspection, inner presences, and the 'inside' quickly recede into the background.... Another way of putting this is to say that, in the shift between the 'inside' that is introspected and the 'outer' doings of Stein's daily life, we encounter our first case of how presence-models of agency are shadowed by person-models of agency." (Chodat 54)

"It is only at the level of persons, in our ordinary habits of sense-making, in our experience as language-users within particular environments, that we see whatever effects such inner phenomena are supposed to generate." (Chodat 54-55)


2.  Embodiment and the Inside

agency as internal disembodied presence v. agency as embodied person

William James's first-person pragmatism (and, later, radical empiricism); Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct -- both present internal notion of language use and thus agency?

Quine, Wittgenstein, and Sellars as a second generation of analytic philosopher, attempting to return discussion to human actions; according to Rorty, the three helped analytic philosophy "grow out of its positivist infancy into what he calls its 'post-positivist' phase, one that was, as he puts it, 'beyond' both empiricism and rationalism" (Chodat 68)

Sellars: postulation v. observation; notion of person subsuming all objects
