Cavell, Stanley.  Pursuits of Happiness: The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage.  Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1981.

INTRODUCTION

Hollywood film, 1934–1949

genre: the comedy of remarriage

genre as “inheritor of the preoccupations and discoveries of Shakespearean romantic comedy” (Cavell 1)

transgressive: heroine is married woman

drive of remarriage plot is not to get couple together, but to get them back together

“thirties” comedies — fairy tales for the Depression?  “in a time of economic depression romances were made in Hollywood that took settings of immense luxury and that depicted people whose actions often concerned the disposition of fantastic sums of  money” (Cavell 2) — but economic causation does not fully explain appearance of the genre

 “the achievement of human happiness requires not the perennial and fuller satisfaction of our needs as they stand but the examination and transformation of those needs.” (Cavell 5)

“This is why our films must on the whole take settings of unmistakable wealth; the people in them must have the leisure to talk about human happiness, hence the time to deprive themselves of it unnecessarily.” (Cavell 5)

“The economic issues in these films, with all their ambivalence and irresolution, are invariably tropes for spiritual issues.” (Cavell 5)

assumes that the films may be self-aware, “reflecting on what it is that causes them” (Cavell 6)

argument for treatment of film as instructive and redemptive/argument for paralleling Hollywood film and philosophy (juxtaposition of Kant and Capra)

“It seems to me that even those who are willing to believe that the details of every motion and position of what the camera depicts, and of every motion and position of the camera that is doing the depicting, may be significant in determining what a film is about — to believe, that is, that the visual facts of a movie you care about may survive the same kind of attention you would give the verbal facts of a literary text you care about — even among these people it is hard to believe that the words spoken in the film should be taken with the same seriousness.” (Cavell 11)

film as medium of drama (though not denying its nature as a visual medium)

ways in which “film exists in a state of philosophy: it is inherently self-reflexive, takes itself as an inevitable part of its craving for speculation; one of its seminal genres — the one in question in the present book — demands the portrayal of philosophical conversation, hence undertakes to portray one of the causes of philosophical dispute.” (Cavell 13-14)

Emerson and “the physiognomy of the ordinary” (Cavell 15)

“a comedy of dailiness” (Cavell 15)

HISTORY:  advent of sound film/creation of a new woman — ‘history of cinema is bound up with history of consciousness of women’ (Cavell 16)

these films as “the primary data for what I would like to call the inner agenda of a culture” (Cavell 17)

struggle for reciprocity between a man and a woman

A Doll(’s) House — “an argument concerning the concepts of forgiveness, inhabitation, conversation, happiness, playtime, becoming human, fathers and husbands, brother and sister, education, scandal, fitness for teaching, honor, becoming strangers, the miracle of change, and the metaphysics of marriage.  The argument of a comedy of remarriage requires, with others, each of these concepts.” (Cavell 22)

sources/adaptations:  “My working hypothesis throughout the following discussions is that the sources of these films bear to them no more decisive or more uniform a relation than, say, the sources of Shakespeare’s plays bear to his plays.” (Cavell 24)

me:  True.  But what is of importance here — what makes Shakespeare’s plays his plays — is what he did to his sources.  What is of importance in studying Hollywood adaptations is what Hollywood does to its sources in producing its own texts.

“My purpose at the moment is to emphasize that translation into the medium of film is inherently unpredictable.  A film will make of a play what it will.” (Cavell 25)

me:  Is this overly anthropomorphic?  A film doesn’t make anything of a play — a producer/director does.

“a narrative or dramatic genre might be thought of as a medium in the visual arts might be thought of, or a ‘form’ in music.  The idea is that the members of a genre share the inheritance of certain conditions, procedures and subjects and goals of composition, and that in primary art each member of such a genre represents a study of these conditions, something I think of as bearing the responsibility of the inheritance.” (Cavell 28)

“Let us think of the common inheritance of the members of a genre as a story, call it a myth.  The members of a genre will be interpretations of it, or to use Thoreau’s word for it, revisions of it, which will also make them interpretations of one another.” (Cavell 31)

“The joining of the sexual and the social is called marriage.  Something evidently internal to the task of marriage causes trouble in paradise — as if marriage, which was to be a ratification, is itself in need of ratification.” (Cavell 31)

justification for conversation about film

CHAPTER 1 — CONS AND PROS: THE LADY EVE

 “some comic version of the story of the expulsion from the Garden of Eden.” (Cavell 47)

“Quoting one editor of The Tempest: ‘For romance deals in marvelous events and solves its problems through metamorphoses and recognition scenes — through, in other words, transformations of perception.’” (Cavell 48)

“tales of romance are inherently feats of cony catching, of conning” (Cavell 48)

feature of Shakespeare’s late romances: father-daughter relationship — “This goes together with the fact that these late plays emphasize the reconciliation of an older generation at the expense of a central interest in the plight of young lovers.  The comedy of remarriage is a natural inheritor of this shift of interest away from the very young.” (Cavell 49)

Northrop Frye:  “All the important writers of English comedy since Jonson have cultivated the comedy of manners with its realistic illusion and not Shakespeare’s romantic and stylized kind . . . The only place where the tradition of Shakespearean romantic comedy has survived with any theatrical success is, as we should expect, in opera.” — Cavell adds: film too  (Cavell 51)

uniqueness of film comparable to jazz? not multiple performances like theatre — “films can only be rerun or remade” (Cavell 52)

issues of virginity/innocence implied by father-daughter rel.

“education” of daughter — lectures from men

“comic resolutions depend upon an acquisition in time of self-knowledge; say this is a matter of learning who you are.  In classical romance this may be accomplished by learning the true story of your birth, where you came from, which amounts to learning the identity of your parents.  In comedies of remarriage it requires learning, or accepting, your sexual identity, the acknowledgement of desire.” (Cavell 56)

absence of children — “purifying the discussion of divorce”? or purifying the discussion of marriage (Cavell 58)

“just enough for two” — no less, no more

“we are at least being told that children, if they appear, must appear as intruders” (Cavell 59)

also, wish of principal pair to become children again (search for innocence)

Eve/Jean in film as metastatement about the nature of film as distinct from stage:  stage allows two people to play two characters who are supposed to be twins no one can tell apart; film allows one person to play two distinct characters who can be told apart  -- theories that “assume we do not know the difference between projections of things and real things and that therefore projections of reality are ‘illusions’ of it.” (Cavell 62)

“The relation between Eve and Jean is not an issue for us, but the nature of the relation of both Eve and Jean to Barbara Stanwyck . . . is an issue for us — an issue in viewing films generally, but declared, acknowledged as an issue in this film by the way it situates the issue of identity.” (Cavell 64)

repeated issue in comedies of remarriage:  splitting between public and private

public=newspapers; film=privacy — split between civilization and eros

must resolve split between erotic and civilized in order for there to be a happy ending

what is revolutionary in these films is that a woman might attempt to unite the erotic and the civilized, or “that a man and a woman might try it together and call that the conjugal.” (Cavell 65)

“revenge comedy” (Cavell 66)

images in mirror — reflexiveness of film

“the inclusion of some event particularly hard to believe is a common feature of Shakespeare’s comedy, as if placed there to exact the greatest effort from his audience’s imagination.” (Cavell 66)

self-awareness/reflectiveness

CHAPTER 2 — KNOWLEDGE AS TRANSGRESSION: IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT

mutual frontiers of film and philosophy

“the acceptance of finitude” (Cavell 73)

humans as inherently suject to transgression

“capacity to relate oneself to the world by knowledge and capacity to relate oneself to others by marriage” (Cavell 74) — world very anxious to limit these properties (will to knowledge/will to  marriage)

limits of human knowing: Kant, Locke, Hume

Locke/Hume:  if our powers to know were expanded, we would know more

Kant:  but we would never quite know enough, not because we are limited in experience but because we are limited to experience

human knowledge different in kind (not just quantity) from God’s knowledge

human knowledge is sequential, time-bound

experience is categorized, and there is no way of knowing if categories are true

but:  the discovery  of our limitations is our greatest discovery: “the great discovery of reason about itself” (Cavell 76)

“moral evil as the will to exempt oneself, to isolate oneself from the human community” (Cavell 80)

not-knowing in the background of the film — limits/barriers (especially the barrier blanket)

symbolism of blanket as Walls of Jericho — will fall by end

woman is Israelites — attacking force — she has trumpet?

if trumpet is man’s, blanket=woman’s virginity or reserve — but comedies of remarriage leave ambiguous whether the man or the woman is the active partner

blanket intended to screen out sexual “turns out to inspire as significant an erotic reaction as the unveiled event would have done.” (Cavell 82)

blanket as typical of sexual censorship — “works — blocking out a literal view of the figure, but receiving physical impressions from it, and activating our imagination of that real figure as we watch in the dark — as a movie screen works.” (Cavell 82)

1934:  acceptance of motion picture Production Code — film parodying this?

role of father (“Ellie Andrews Escapes Father”) — lecturing:  “man’s lecturing indicates that an essential goal of the narrative is the education of the woman” (Cavell 84)

genre of remarriage meant to make us wonder what consitutes marriage:  living together? bickering?

Milton, Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce — defense of marriage in the form of a defense of divorce

marriage=conversation

in these films, talking together=marriage; pair learning to speak the same language

doing nothing together — requires leisure to waste time

ambivalence:  Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents — love and aggression  (Gable’s he-man nature coupled with nurturant parental side

relationship of food and parental love (consuming, consummation)

eating the carrot as expression of her acceptance of her humanity?

food — hunger=longing (film is about what people really hunger for) — identification of hunger and imagination — “love as the willingness to admit the satisfaction of hunger” (Cavell 96)

soft focus v. hard focus

“The genre of remarriage invites us to speak of putting together imagination and perception in terms of putting together night and day — say dreams and responsibilities” (Cavell 101)

“metaphysical privacy” (Cavell 102)

comedies of remarriage as comedies of freedom — must be free to remarry — “The intimacy conditional on narcissism or incestuousness must be ruptured in order that an intimacy of difference or reciprocity supervene.” (Cavell 103)

“That the barrier works like a movie screem means that out position as audience is to be read in terms of the man and woman’s positions with each other, and expecially in terms of the man’s, for it is with him that we first watch the screen [blanket] take on the characteristics of a movie screen, and his problem of putting together a real woman with a projected image of her seems a way of describing our business as viewers.” (Cavell 105)

film as film/Peter as director/Ellie as star

“He is behaving as though announcing the event in the newspaper will not only make it public but make it happen” (Cavell 108)

limits of human being — cannot create the world with the word

CHAPTER 3 — LEOPARDS IN CONNECTICUT: BRINGING UP BABY

“the achievement of purposiveness without purpose (or say directedness without direction)” (Cavell 113) — Kant’s characterization of the aesthetic experience? — connection to play of childhood

pair’s attempts to extricate themselves from one another — “the attempt at flight is forever transforming itself into (hence revealing itself as) a process of pursuit” (Cavell 113)

Freudian analysis of film: parapraxis, double entendre, repetition

“obsessive sexual references” (Cavell 117) — bone, behind (tail) — we do not know how far to push these references

anxiety produced in the play between the literal and allegorical

end — collapse of science with acknowledgement of sexuality?

comedy of remarriage works to avoid Old Comedy/New Comedy distinctions, so leaves ambiguous whether the man or the woman is the “hero,” the active partner — who is following whom?

comedy of equality?  “The equality of laughter at the idea of difference is enough to ensure that, unlike the case of classical comedies, there can in general be no social reconciliation at these conclusions, for society does not regard the difference between men and women as the topic of a metaphysical argument” (Cavell 123)

comedy of equality=comedy of privacy

world of childhood just before puberty (Freud: latency)

two questions stand as obstacles to satidfactory resolution (marriage):  1.  “If adulthood is the price of sexual happiness, is the price fair?”  2.  “If virginity at some point becomes humiliating and laughable, then why must departing from it be humiliating and laughable?” (Cavell 125)

“laughter at the realization that after more than two millenia of masterpieces on the subject, we are still not clear why, or to what extent, marriage is thought to justify sexual satisfaction. (That such comedies are no longer made perhaps means that we have given up on this problem, or publicized it to death.)” (Cavell 126)

question posed by the film about the validation of marriage

“Put a bit more metaphysically: only those can genuinely marry who are already married.  It is as though you know you are married when you come to see that you cannot divorce, that is, when you find that your lives simply will not disentangle.” (Cavell 127)

connection to 19th century French farce (Feydeau’s On purge Bébé) — film v. play:  film’s tendency to give precedence to actor over character

right to happiness/legitimacy of marriage

CHAPTER 4 — THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPORTANCE: THE PHILADEPHIA STORY

2 heroes: why is one chosen over the other? partially class reasons, but primarily that Grant grew up with Hepburn and Stewart didn’t (marriage and divorce=growing up) — some kind of childhood together is necessary for the happiness of the couple in this genre

Freud:  female Oedipal conflict — women marry men like fathers in hostility toward mothers — second marriages generally better

Grant as “director” of film — instructions to actress on how to behave (subject of the genre of remarriage is the creation of the new woman)

“Our genre emphasizes the mystery of marriage by finding that neither law not sexuality (nor, by implication, progeny) is sufficient to ensure true marriage and suggesting that what provides legitimacy is the mutual willingness for remarriage, for a sort of continuous reaffirmation, and one in which the couple’s isolation from the rest of society is generally marked” (Cavell 142)

The Philadelphia Story as Othello, with Othello’s character divided in 3 (and all the jealousy conveniently in one) — see also A Midsummer Night’s Dream: Tracy as Titania/Dexter as Oberon?

Dexter’s drinking problem:  “my gorgeous thirst” — thirst for what? truth, self-knowledge? (alcohol’s powers to “open your eyes”) her desire?  (her eyes are closed to her own desire)

accepting one’s own desire=accepting one’s human imperfections

Freud: “the finding of an object is in fact the refinding of it”

demand to determine for oneself what is important is the mark of a philosopher

Milton:  covenant of marriage as miniature of covenant of the commonwealth — gives national importance to happiness in marriage; makes it clear that an “ill marriage,” like a tyrranic government, must be overthrown — Philadelphia as site of national covenants

The Philadephia Story as attempt to discredit Veblen? — “it seems clear enough to me that Veblen’s book is quite deaf to the rights of the sensuous or erotic side of human nature and that it draws too simple, or too angry, a picture of the line between the necessary and the luxurious” (Cavell 155)

question about whether America will produce a “natural aristocracy,” a “rule by the best,” yet it is hard to say in an “egalitarian” society what anyone is “best” at — “I think in fact something like that idea, however dated, even dangerous, it may sound to us, is bound to haunt a society whose idea of itself requires that it repudiate the hierarchies and enforcements of the European past and make a new beginning, to make in effect a reformation of the human condition.” (Cavell 156)

expulsion of George as expulsion of lower classes or expulsion of the idea of class?

Matthew Arnold, Culture and Anarchy:  the best self as reconception of idea of aristocracy

“I do not say that film in inherently democratic, only that the distinctions enforced by clothes, airs, and reputations in ordinary contexts are quite irrelevant to the distinctions it draws for itself.” (Cavell 158)

marriage in The Philadelphia Story proposes to unite/balance the two forces of authority in culture (Arnold:  Hebraism and Hellenism)

pictures at end as record of public event — Frye:  at end of Shakespeare’s romances, we are m oved from position of observer to position of participant — movie reverses, from participant to observer

CHAPTER 5 — COUNTERFEITING HAPPINESS: HIS GIRL FRIDAY

how to overcome a divorce — divorce is  not a sacrament  (What is between them — marriage? — divorce cannot undo, but he must help her free herself from her divorce.)

must help her escape not unhappiness but a counterfeit unhappiness

following laws of genre:  woman has been created by man

distinction between satiric and romantic comedy — Nevill Coghill:  Jonsonian (satiric)=town dwellers, middle-class, teaches what is to be avoided; Shakespearean (romantic)=pastoral, aristocratic, teaches what is to be grasped — His Girl Friday as introduction of a Shakespearean pair into a Jonsonian environment

Locke/Hobbes — state of nature v. state of war

“the concept of marriage, understood as remarriage, as a search for reaffirmation, is not merely an analogy of the social bond, or a comment upon it, but it is a further instance of experimentation in consent and reciprocity.  Thus does marriage again become of national importance.” (Cavell 182)

glimpse of the failure of civilization to make human beings civil in each of these films — issue of these comedies is how we are given to understand the relation of the pair to this world — how they escape its evils

possibility of reprieve/escape (film as escape?)

“if they can be at home in that black world, they are at home anywhere, at home in the world.  They have achieved the goal of romance.” (Cavell 186)

“It is a premiss of farce that marriage kills romance.  It is a project of the genre of remarriage to refuse to draw a conclusion from this premiss but rather to turn the tables on farce, to turn marriage itself into romance, into adventure, which for Walter and Hildy means to preserve within it something of the illicit, to find as it were a moral equivalent of the immoral” (Cavell 186)

film asking us to consider what the effect/significance of film is

CHAPTER 6 — THE COURTING OF MARRIAGE: ADAM’S RIB

pair consistently “at home” — intimacy of couple with audience — sense of participation or partnership in their intimacy

takes their marriage to court — parallel marriage in case (ended in shooting) — not just bringing charges against her own marriage but also questioning whether courts are capable of determining the validity of a marriage

fate of the marriage bond mean to epitomize the fate of the democratic social bond

film of marriage/trial of marriage as Punch and Judy show

husband must undergo a certain humiliation

woman’s attempt to make something public v. man’s attempt to make something private

comedy of remarriage is the idea that choice between the erotic and the legal may not be final

“readings” of a film to determine what a cinematic event is — “A camera cannot in general just abide or progress, just be continuous or discontinuous; it has to abide on something, and move or dissolve from something to something.  As the mind cannot in general just think or the eye just see, but has to think of something, look at or for or away from something.” (Cavell 203)

Phenomenology:  mind takes objects=intentional; camera takes subjects=inflectional — reading a film=accounting for its inflections — consequences of such powers of the camera for concept of reality

“The last thing this poetry takes for granted is the nature of itself as an instrument, the nature of its changes; the last thing a camera, or an ambitious student of the camera, should take for granted is the nature of the camera.” (Cavell 204) — “the study of the camera cannot be exhausted by the determination, however complete, of what I was calling the motivation of the camera, that is by film criticism (so conceived), but must invoke the question of the existence of the camera as such, that is by the issue of what I called film theory.” (Cavell 204)

marriage as public and private; marriage as conjoined with private ownership of a house — economic issues?  1.  Only those who can afford a house can afford to pursue happiness; 2.  Economics tropes a more general issue of human happiness, “the cost of joint inhabitation” (Cavell 208)

husband’s mugging for the camera creates conspiracy with audience, “the classical position of the charming, expansive villan (Iago, Edmund)” (Cavell 210)

“the necessity of remarriage as the necessity of taking marriage to court: you must test it in the open or else mutual independence is threatened” (Cavell 216) — audience as jury

“The creation of innocence through the right forgoing of virginity — such is the fantasy around which more than out genre alone has formed itself.” (Cavell 219)

camera as revealing reverse sexual nature of human subjects; camera as revealing otherwise invisible self (Blake’s Specter and Emanation); reflexiveness/self-referentiality of objects filmed & projected

“an untrammelled absorption in the conversation of marriage cannot take place in the presence of children.” (Cavell 226)

CHAPTER 7 — THE SAME AND DIFFERENT: THE AWFUL TRUTH

“Tragedy is the necessity of having your experience and learning from it; comedy is the possibility of having it in good time.” (Cavell 238)

“The tracking of the comedic to its roots in the everyday.” (Cavell 239)

expectations that classical comedy has of ending with a festival (wedding); in these films, festival has already happened, and “all our life should be festival” (Cavell 239) — transformation of festival (moment) into festivity (ongoing) in the comedy of dailiness

singing throughout the films of remarriage

“Even in America, the land of the second chance, and of transcendentalist redeemers, the paradox inevitably arises:  you cannot change the world (for example, a state of marriage) until the people in it change, and the people cannot change until the world changes.” (Cavell 257)
