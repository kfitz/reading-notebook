Jenkins, Henry.  Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide.  New York:  NYU Press, 2006.


Introduction

"This book is about the relationship between three concepts -- media convergence, participatory culture, and collective intelligence." (Jenkins 2)

"By convergence, I mean the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want." (Jenkins 2)

"I will argue here against the idea that convergence should be understood primarily as a technological process bringing together multiple media functions within the same devices.  Instead, convergence represents a cultural shift as consumers are encouraged to seek out new information and make connections among dispersed media content." (Jenkins 3)

"Convergence does not occur through media appliances, however sophisticated they may become.  Convergence occurs within the brains of individual consumers and through their social interactions with others." (Jenkins 3)

Ithiel de Sola Pool as "prophet of convergence"

"Two decades later, I find myself reexamining some of the core questions Pool raised -- about how we maintain the potential of participatory culture in the wake of growing media concentration, about whether the changes brought about by convergence open new opportunities for expression or expand the power of big media." (Jenkins 11)

"To define media, let's turn to historian Lisa Gitelman, who offers a model of media that works on two levels: on the first, a medium is a technology that enables communication; on the second, a medium is a set of associated 'protocols' or social and cultural practices that have grown up around that technology.  Delivery systems are simply and only technologies; media are also cultural systems.  Delivery technologies come and go all the time, but media persist as layers within an ever more complicated information and entertainment stratum." (Jenkins 13-14, referencing Gitelman, Always Already New)

"This book will have less to say about the technological dimensions of media change than about the shifts in the protocols by which we are producing and consuming media." (Jenkins 14)

"On the one hand, convergence represents an expanded opportunity for media conglomerates, since content that succeeds in one sector can spread across other platforms.  On the other, convergence represents a risk since most of these media fear a fragmentation or erosion of their markets." (Jenkins 19)


Chapter 1 -- Spoiling Survivor: The Anatomy of a Knowledge Community

Pierre Lévy and collective intelligence:  "this ability of virtual communities to leverage the combined expertise of their members.  What we cannot know or do on our own, we may now be able to do collectively.  And this organization of audiences into what Lévy calls knowledge communities allows them to exert a greater aggregate power in their negotiations with media producers." (Jenkins 27)

sometime think about teaching this chapter alongside Gibson's _Pattern Recognition_

tensions between the openness of knowledge communities and attempts to reestablish a field of "experts"

similar tensions between the spoilers and the producers, who both want to encourage the kind of play that spoiling fosters while disrupting the spoilers' abilities to actually obtain the knowledge they seek

difference between "spoiling" and "ruining"

"What holds a collective intelligence together is not the possession of knowledge -- which is relatively static, but the social process of acquiring knowledge -- which is dynamic and participatory, continually testing and reaffirming the group's social ties." (Jenkins 54)


Chapter 2 -- Buying into American Idol: How We Are Being Sold on Reality Television

"affective economics":  "a new configuration of marketing theory, still somewhat on the fringes but gaining ground within the media industry, which seeks to understand the emotional underpinnings of consumer decision-making as a driving force behind viewing and purchasing decisions." (Jenkins 61-62)

shift from thinking about advertising "impressions" to thinking about advertising "expressions" -- not just exposure to ad, but response to it; creation of "brand community"; "lovemarks"

interactions of zappers, casuals, and loyals around tv series

use of gossip as part of fan engagement with show


Chapter 3 -- Searching for the Origami Unicorn:  The Matrix and Transmedia Storytelling

interrelationship of multiple texts in Matrix universe:  3 films, Animatrix videos, games -- transmedia storytelling

"Pierre Lévy speculated about what kind of aesthetic works would respond to the demands of his knowledge cultures.  First, he suggests that the 'distinction between authors and readers, producers and spectators, creators and interpreters will blend' to form a 'circuit' (not quite a matrix) of expression, with each participant working to 'sustain the activity' of the others.  The artwork will be what Lévy calls a 'cultural attractor,' drawing together and creating common ground between diverse communities; we might also describe it as a cultural activator, setting into motion their decipherment, speculation, and elaboration." (Jenkins 95)

economic motives for convergence are profound, but also driven by new ideas of synergy -- not just licensing, but creating complex universes

collaborative authorship

world-making and the mythological

"additive comprehension" and the origami unicorn from Blade Runner -- the one bit of extra knowledge that changes the interpretation of the narrative

"In _The Internet Galaxy_ cybertheorist Manuel Castells claims that while the public had shown limited interest in hypertexts, they have developed a hypertextual relationship to existing media content: 'Our minds -- not our machines -- process culture.... If our minds have the material capability to access the whole realm of cultural expressions -- select them, recombine them -- we do have a hypertext: the hypertext is inside us.'" (Jenkins 129, quoting Castells)


Chapter 4 -- Quentin Tarantino's Star Wars?: Grassroots Creativity Meets the Media Industry

"Fan digital film is to cinema what the punk DYI [sic] culture was to music." (Jenkins 132)

"If, as some have argued, the emergence of modern mass media spelled the doom for the vital folk culture traditions that thrived in nineteenth-century America, the current moment of media change is reaffirming the right of everyday people to actively contribute to their culture.  Like the older folk culture of quilting bees and barn dances, this new vernacular culture encourages broad participation, grassroots creativity, and a bartering or gift economy.  This is what happens when consumers take media into their own hands.  Of course, this may be altogether the wrong way to talk about it -- since in a folk culture, there is no clear division between producers and consumers.  Within convergence culture, everyone's a participant -- although participants may have different degrees of status and influence." (Jenkins 132)

two characteristic responses of industry to fan participation:  prohibition and collaboration

"popular culture is what happens as mass culture gets pulled back into folk culture" (Jenkins 136)

"Marketers have turned our children into walking, talking billboards who wear logos on their T-shirts, sew patches on their backpacks, plaster stickers on their lockers, hang posters on their walls, but they must not, under penalty of law, post them on their home pages." (Jenkins 138)

various responses of Lucasfilm to fan-produced films; some supported, others not:  "Lucas wants to be 'celebrated' but not appropriated" (Jenkins 149)

Lucasfilm decision to offer fans free web space -- canny choice that allows them greater control over fan production

Star Wars Galaxies and machinima; simultaneously open to user modding and resistant to certain user desires


Chapter 5 -- Why Heather Can Write:  Media Literacy and the Harry Potter Wars

two wars in Potterverse:  one from Christian right, trying to pull books from stores and libraries (to prevent children reading); one from Warner Brothers, trying to rein in fan appropriations (to prevent children writing)

Heather Lawver's _The Daily Prophet_

"The example of _The Daily Prophet_ suggests yet another important cultural competency:  role-playing both as a means of exploring a fictional realm and as a means of developing a richer understanding of yourself and the culture around you." (Jenkins 176)

"What's striking about this process, though, is that it takes place outside the classroom and beyond any direct adult control.  Kids are teaching kids what they need to become full participants in convergence culture." (Jenkins 177)

"As we expand access to mass distribution via the Web, our understanding of what it means to be an author -- and what kinds of authority should be ascribed to authors -- necessarily shifts.  This shift could lead to a heightened awareness of intellectual property rights as more and more people feel a sense of ownership over the stories they create.  Yet, it also can result in a demystification of the creative process, a growing recognition of the communal dimensions of expression, as writing takes on more aspects of traditional folk practice." (Jenkins 179)

"beta-reading" as peer-review process

"Schools are still locked into a model of autonomous learning that contrasts sharply with the kinds of learning that are needed as students are entering the new knowledge cultures." (Jenkins 183)

Lawver founded "Defense Against the Dark Arts" after WB began issuing cease-and-desist orders to some fan sites; WB wound up correcting its position, to some extent
