Williams, Raymond.  Television: Technology and Cultural Form.  Hanover, NH: Wesleyan University Press, 1992.


INTRODUCTION by Lynn Spigel

“best remembered for its analysis of television’s rhetoric as ‘flow’ — the mobile and fluid transmission of unrelated texts (ads, programs, promotional material) into an overall mode of experience that we call watching TV.” (Spigel x)

“the conviction that cultural forms were historical and material practices, a part of the way in which men and women make their lives” (Spigel xiii)

cultural materialism: idea of culture as material force; opposed to base/superstructure division, with only economic processes as “real”

against technological determinism, esp. that of McLuhan

institutional forms for using media based on four general arrangements: paternalism, authoritarianism, commercialism, democracy

“Our systems look the way they do not because of the inherent properties of the media or even because they were somehow ‘symptomatic’ of larger social needs, but because they were fashioned that way through political and economic choices.” (Spigel xix)

social contradiction: “free” and “independent” commercial system? “a product of the paradoxes at the heart of our larger society” (Spigel xxi) — mobility and privatization


1. THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE SOCIETY

anti-“effects” research

A. VERSIONS OF CAUSE AND EFFECT IN TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY

technological determinism: “The effects of the technologies, whether direct or indirect, foreseen or unforeseen, are as it were the rest of history.  The steam engine, the automobile, television, the atomic bomb, have made modern man and the modern condition.” (Williams 7)

symptomatic technology: emphasizes other causal factors; sees technologies as symptoms of change

but both abstract technology from society; technology as self-acting force

possible to outline a different kind of interpretation: “Such an interpretation would differ from technological determinism in that it would restore intention to the process of research and development.  The technology would be seen, that is to say, as being looked for and developed with certain purposes and practices already in mind.  At the same time the interpretation woudl differ from symptomatic technology in that these purposes and practices would be seen as direct: as known social needs, purposes and practices to which the technology is not marginal, but central.” (Williams 8)

B. THE SOCIAL HISTORY OF TELEVISION AS A TECHNOLOGY

television developing from multiple technologies: electricity, radio, photography, film

“Through this whole period two facts are evident: that a system of television was foreseen, and its means were being actively sought; but also that, by comparison with electrical generation and electrical telegraphy and telephony, there was very little social investment to bring the scattered work together.” (Williams 11) — all technologies at first tending toward business or transport communication, and only later social communication

communications systems all foreseen in a technical sense before they were possible

C. THE SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE USES OF TELEVISION TECHNOLOGY

communications system being developed to serve needs of military and commercial systems; social needs secondary

development of press as response to development of extended social, economic, and political system and response to crisis within that system; need for new form to transmit news: “An increased awareness of mobility and change, not just as abstractions but as lived experience, led to a major redefinition, in practice and then in theory, of the function and process of social communication.” (Williams 16)

first definitions of broadcasting were for radio; these definitions were those within which television developed

if seen in hindsight, broadcasting as new and powerful form of social integration and control; “mass communication”; mass = mob; state intervention in broadcasting

“Unlike all previous communications technologies, radio and television were systems primarily devised for transmission and reception as abstract processes, with little or no definition of preceding content.” (Williams 19)

“Socially, this complex is characterized the the two apparently paradoxical yet deeply connected tendencies of modern industrial living:  on the one hand mobility, on the other hand the more apparently self-sufficient family home.” (Williams 20) — broadcasting as product of mobile privatization

“The cinema had remained at an earlier level of social definition; it was and remains a special kind of theatre, offering specific and discrete works of one general kind.  Broadcasting, by contrast, offered a whole social intake: music, news, entertainment, sport.” (Williams 23)

inexpensiveness of broadcasting things that were happening or had happened v. expensiveness of new production; led to licensing, advertising

2. INSTITUTIONS OF THE TECHNOLOGY

A. TYPES OF EARLY DEVELOPMENT

“the directing impulse came from the manufacturers of broadcasting apparatus, and especially of receivers” (Williams 26), but also interests of national security; formation of the BBC

common pressures: “broadcasting was developed not only within a capitalist society but specifically by the capitalist manufacturers of the technological apparatus” (Williams 28)

bargain struck in Britain between state and capitalist interests; in other Western Eur. countries, more direct state regulation (including fascist and communist countries); alternative solution was U.S. model: simple applied technology, determined by manufacturing institutions; state enters only as market-regulatory control

early development as contrast or competition between “public service” and “commercial” institutions

“As in the general rhetoric of the defense of capitalism, commercial broadcasting does not call itself commercial, let alone capitalist.  It uses public-relations descriptions like ‘free’ and ‘independent,’ and often contrasts itself with ‘monopoly’ and ‘state control.’” (Williams 31)

B. TYPES OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENT

determining factor in broadcasting since 1950s: expansion of American comm system

military/political comm system and ability of this system to penetrate other states: see USIA

sale of programs overseas; international advertisers

“The ‘commercial’ character of television has then to be seen a several levels: as the making of programmes for profit in a known market; as a channel for advertising; and as a cultural and political form directly shaped by and dependent on the norms of a capitalist society” (Williams 35)

3. THE FORMS OF TELEVISION

A. COMBINATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF EARLIER FORMS

1. News

broadcast news originally had no means of news collection; relied on outside agencies

four headings of relations between broadcast news and newspaper:

(a) Sequence:  newspaper as mosaic; reader scans and then decides where to concentrate; broadcast news as linear in time

(b) Priorities:  newspaper has ways of catching attention, but subject to reader capacity/ choice; broadcast news retains more apparent editorial control of priority and attention

(c) Presentation:  prior to WW2, British broadcaster was “an anonymous authoritative (ruling-class) voice” (Williams 41); American system has “immediate self-introduction”; BBC efforts to limit presenter to reading function, showing writers or papers being handed in; American tv more informal, with men telling things they happen to know

(d) Visualization:  visual presentation; which side is the camera on?

2. Argument and Discussion

American system: access to Senate hearings, free-speech messages, etc.

British system: wider area of specially arranged discussion and argument programs

tension between these processes of public argument and discussion and the political process; resentment of government for media; television as mediator between political process and constituencies; television has monopoly on the reactive process?

3-9. Education; Drama; Films; Variety; Sport; Advertising; Pastimes

B. MIXED AND NEW FORMS

1-6. Drama-documentary; Education by Seeing; Discussion; Features; Sequences; Television

4.  PROGRAMMING: DISTRIBUTION AND FLOW

A. COMPARATIVE DISTRIBUTION IN FIVE TELEVISION CHANNELS

B. PROGRAMMING AS SEQUENCE OR FLOW

distribution as abstract and static; sequence/flow as characteristic organization

flow as part of a general trend towards an increasing variability and miscellaneity of public communications (part of a whole social experience)

significant shift from the concept of sequence as programming to the concept of sequence as flow

distinctions between “flow” and commercial “interruptions”

C. ANALYSIS OF FLOW

5. EFFECTS OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND ITS USES

A. CAUSE AND EFFECT IN COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS

“To say that television is now a factor in socialization, or that its controllers and communicators are exercising a particular social function, is to say very little until the forms of the society which determine any particular socialization and which allowcate the functions of control and communication have been precisely specified.” (Williams 114)

B. SOME STUDIES OF EFFECTS

C. THE TECHNOLOGY AS A CAUSE

anti-McLuhanite

D. TECHNOLOGY AS AN EFFECT

6. ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGY, ALTERNATIVE USES?

A. THE DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY

further development of receivers, cable systems, visual information systems, satellite communications, video cassettes, video equipment, interactive television

B. INSTITUTIONS OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY

C. ALTERNATIVE USES
