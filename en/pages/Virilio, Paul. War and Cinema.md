Virilio, Paul.  War and Cinema:  The Logistics of Perception.  Trans. Patrick Camiller.  London:  Verso, 1989.

Preface to the English Edition:  The Sight Machine

relationship between military conflicts and development of visual technologies

from military photography during the Civil War to today’s video surveillance

use of film during WW1; means for armies of “regularly updating their picture of reality” (Virilio 1); produced “logistics of military perception, in which a supply of images would become the equivalent of an ammunition supply” (Virilio 1)

after WW2, a “strategy of global vision” (Virilio 1); shifting to computer-driven surveillance and weaponry and defense systems; a “sight machine,” allowing the “assumption of cybernetics into the heavens” (Virilio 2)

“alongside the ‘war machine,’ there has always existed an ocular (and later optical and electro-optical) ‘watching machine’ capable of providing soldiers, and particularly commanders, with a visual perspective on the military action under way.” (Virilio 3)

“what is perceived is already lost” (Virilio 4)

1.  Military Force Is Based Upon Deception (Sun Tzu)

“There is no war, then, without representation, no sophisticated weaponry without psychological mystification.  Weapons are tools not just of destruction but also of perception...” (Virilio 6)

Reagan’s “Star Wars” plans, cinematic missile defense using mirrors and lasers

theatre weapon has replaced theatre of operations; “the history of battle is primarily the history of radically changing fields of perception” (Virilio 7)

connection of German war machine to film, and especially color film; Goebbels’s “obsession with the American perceptual arsenal” (Virilio 9)

Napoleon:  “the capacity for war is the capacity for movement” (Virilio 10)

2.  Cinema Isn’t I See, It’s I Fly (Nam June Paik)

Gatling’s crank-driven machine gun, 1861; Janssen’s revolving camera, 1874 — from this came Marey’s “chronophotographic rifle” (Virilio 11)

during Civil War, “Union forces equipped balloons with an aerial-mapping telegraph.  Soon the army was rigging together the most varied combinations:  camera-kites, camera-pigeons and camera-balloons predated the intensive use of chronophotography and cinematography on board small reconnaissance aircraft” (Virilio 11)

D.W. Griffith only American filmmaker authorized to shoot at the front during WW1

“Just as the nitrocellulose that went into film stock was also used for the production of explosives, so the artilleryman’s motto was the same as the cameraman’s:  lighting reveals everything.” (Virilio 15)

“At the turn of the century, cinema and aviation seemed to form a single moment....  In fact, contrary to what is generally thought, the air arm grew out of the reconnaissance services, its military value having initially been questioned by the general staffs.  Indeed the reconnaissance aircraft itself, whose function was to supply ground troops with information, to direct artillery barrages or to take photographs, gained acceptance merely as a ‘flying observation post,’ almost as static as the old balloon with its cartographers, pencils and paper.” (Virilio 17) — see Jean Renoir

U.S. rethought aerial observation in Vietnam; “real-time” information

war machine as instrument of representation (Virilio 20)

scopophilia and the wartime pin-up:  “Like the soldier, the striptease dancer who undresses on stage becomes a film for spectators, slowly taking off her clothes in a series of takes in which her lascivious body-movements act as the overlapping dissolve and the music as the sound-track.” (Virilio 22)

“For his part Joseph Goebbels, that ex-journalist turned head of propaganda, had come up with many new ideas in the inter-war period.  In helping Hitler to power, he had sent fifty thousand fascist propaganda records to gramophone-owning households and had forced cinema managers, often under threat of violence, to screen ideologically loaded shorts.  Once he became a minister, he ensured that radio sets were within reach of everyone’s pocket.” (Virilio 24)

connections of photography and the 19th century spiritualist movement

“It is significant that the star system only really triumphed after 1914 in the new cinema industry, at a time when optical illusion became confused not just with the illusion of life but with the illusion of survival.” (Virilio 30)

3.  Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter the Hell of Images (Abel Gance)

cinema-cathedrals; images and death; the Holocaust

“According to J.F.C. Fuller, any individual, man or women, is potentially a nervous target, and in fact it was the precision of the camera-shot which first created audience panic at the Lumières’ ‘motion demonstrations’ of the train’s arrival at la Ciotat, when everyone felt that they risked being crushed or injured by the train.  This kind of fear, akin to the sense of speed that people seek on roller coasters, did not disappear but simply became more pernicious as the audience learnt to control its nervous reactions and began to find death amusing.” (Virilio 39-40)

cinemas as “training camps which bonded people together in the face of death agony, teaching them to master the fear of what they did not know” (Virilio 40)

cinema and im/morality

4.  The Imposture of Immediacy (Dietrich Bonhoeffer)

elimination of distance through speed and images

the “cinematic artifice of the war machine” (Virilio 48); war simulators

5.  The ‘Fern Andra’ Cinema

parallel between WWI Hollywood war-boosterism and Hitler’s deployment of the cinema in the Third Reich?

Hitler’s skill with illusion, and interest in fakirism

Triumph of the Will

cameraman attached to each German platoon; propaganda company within each regiment

“Only recently has it been realized that the Allies’ victory in the Second World War was at least partly due to their grasp of the real nature of Nazi Lebensraum, and to their decision to attack the core of Hitler’s power by undermining his charismatic infallibility.  They did this by making themselves the leading innovators in film technology.” (Virilio 59)

6.  Sicut Prior est Tempore ita quo Potior Iure (priority in time gives priority in law)

more bleed between movies and reality:  To Be or Not to Be and (fake) preparations for Normandy staged for German spy cameras

military technologies in contemporary film production

“Like the new opaque cockpits which prevent fighter pilots from looking outside, because ‘seeing is dangerous’, war and its technologies have gradually eliminated theatrical and pictorial effects in processing the battle image, and total war followed by deterrence have tended to cancel the scenario effect itself in a permanent technological ambience devoid of any substratum.” (Virilio 66)

unreality of images:  live broadcast

7.  A Travelling Shot over Eighty Years

the ‘war of light’ — use of artificial illumination in warfare — begins in 1904 with the first use of a searchlight in battle:  “Its beam pierced more than that darkness of the Russo-Japanese war; it illuminated a future which observation and destruction would develop at the same pace.” (Virilio 68)

expansion of the military field of perception:  “Eyesight and direct vision have gradually given way to optical or opto-electronic processes, to the most sophisticated forms of ‘telescopic sight’.” (Virilio 69)

nuclear flash at Hiroshima as ultimate photographic device

“The fusion is complete, the confusion perfect:  nothing now distinguishes the functions of the weapon and the eye; the projectile’s image and the image’s projectile form a single composite.” (Virilio 83)
