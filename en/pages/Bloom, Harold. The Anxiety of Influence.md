Bloom, Harold. The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry. New York: Oxford University Press, 1973.


Oscar Wilde failed as a poet "because he lacked the strength to overcome his anxiety of influence" (Bloom 5-6)

anxiety of influencING:  a fear that one is giving away (via influence) what is most precious to oneself (6)

Wilde:  "to influence a person is to give him one's own soul" (Bloom 6)

"poetic influence is a variety of melancholy or an anxiety-principle" (Bloom 7) -- is this predominantly a modern phenomenon?  By the time we reach postmodernism, medlancholy seems to have given way to mania (see Jameson)

anxiety of influence examines "the relations between poets as cases akin to what Freud called the family romance" (Bloom 8)

on sublimation:  "To equate emotional maturation with the discovery of acceptable substitutes may be pragmatic wisdom, particularly in the realm of Eros, but this is not the wisdom of the strong poets" (Bloom 9) -- strong poets condemned to the unwisdom of fighting nature with art on nature's ground

Shakespeare excluded because he represents "the absolute absorption of the precursor" (11) -- what must it have been to be Marlowe?

"Battle between strong equals, father and son as mighty opposites, Laius and Oedipus at the crossroads" (Bloom 11)

"In the contemporary poems that most move me... I can recognize a strength that battles against the death of poetry, yet also the exhaustions of being a latecomer" (Bloom 12) -- like the postmodern novel, a constant war against death/belatedness?

"really strong poets can only read themselves" (Bloom 19) -- is this part of the problem?  Poets can stop reading the precursor, but novelists can never fully escape the media

poetic influence is "a disease of self-consciousness" (Bloom 29)

central argument: "Poetic influence -- when it involves two strong, authentic poets -- always proceeds by a misreading of the prior poet, an act of creative correction that is actually and necessarily a misinterpretation.  The history of fruitful poetic influence, which is to say the main tradition of Western poetry since the Renaissance, is a history of anxiety and self-saving caricature, of distortion, of perverse, wilful revisionism without which modern poetry as such could not exist" (Bloom 30)

in poetic influence, the precursor (Milton, say) is seen as the Covering Cherub, "blocking a new voice from entering the Poet's Paradise" (Bloom 35) -- in novelistic obsolescence, the media doesn't block new voices out, keeping those in paradise removed and holy, but rather undoes the effects of paradise by creating a paradise of its own:  'you're a novelist? good for you, and so what. novelists don't matter'

"But what is the Primal Scene, for a poet *as poet*?  It is his Poetic Father's coitus with the Muse.  There he was begotten?  No -- there they failed to beget him.  He must be self-begotten, he must engender himself upon the Muse his mother" (Bloom 36-37)

"To beget here means to usurp" (Bloom 37)

Nietzsche:  "Every talent must unfold itself in fighting" -- see Mao II?

"Kierkegaard, in *Fear and Trembling*, announces, with magnificent but absurdly apocalyptic confidence, that 'he who is willing to work gives birth to his own father.'  I find truer to mere fact the aphoristic admission of Nietzsche:  'When one hasn't had a good father, it is necessary to invent one'" (Bloom 56)

"When a poet experiences incarnation *qua* poet, he experiences anxiety necessarily towards any danger that might *end him* as a poet" (Bloom 58)

poems give us pleasure, but are created out of unpleasure, anxiety

revisionary ratios of strong poets "have the same function in intrapoetic relations that defense mechanisms have in our psychic life" (Bloom 88)

"A poem is not an overcoming of anxiety, but is that anxiety" (Bloom 94)

"A poem is a poet's melancholy at his lack of priority" (Bloom 96)

"Negation of the precursor is never possible, since no ephebe can afford to yield even momentarily to the death instinct.  For poetic divination intend literal immortality, and any poem may be defined as a side-stepping of a possible death" (Bloom 102)

"The thrust of *daemonization* is towards a Counter-Sublime, or what post-Freudian vitalists like Marcuse and Brown evidently hope to mean when they speak of what Freud called a return of the repressed" (Bloom 106) -- but the repressed cannot return in poems

"Strong poems that too explicitly rewrite precursor poems tend to become *poems of conversion*, and conversion is not an aesthetic phenomenon..." (108)

"Whether sublimation of sexual instincts plays a central part in the genesis of poetry is hardly relevant to the reading of poetry, and has no part in the dialectic of misprision.  But sublimation of aggressive instincts is central to writing and reading poetry, and this is almost identical with the total process of misprision" (Bloom 115)

"Each poem is an evasion not only of another poem, but also of itself, which is to say that every poem is a misinterpretation of what it might have been" (Bloom 120)

"*clinamen* and *tessera* strive to correct or complete the dead, and *kenosis* and *daemonization* work to repress memory of the dead, but *askesis* is the contest proper, the match-to-the-death with the dead" (Bloom 122)

"Freud, revising himself, at last concluded that it was anxiety that produced repression and not repression that produced anxiety" (Bloom 135)

"the largest irony of the revisionary ratio of *apophrades* is that the later poets, confronting the imminence of death, work to subvert the immortality of their precursors, as though any one poet's afterlife could be metaphorically prolonged at the expense of another's" (Bloom 151)
