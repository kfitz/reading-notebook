Tabbi, Joseph. Postmodern Sublime: Technology and American Writing From Mailer to Cyberpunk. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1995.


despite the postmodern trend toward minimalist forms and distrust of expansive gestures, the sublime persists as a powerful force in postmodern writing, especially in works that read reality as something newly mediated by science and technology (Tabbi ix)

Kant's sublime object (power in nature) replaced in postmodern lit by technological process -- see Jameson:Â  'Our faulty representations of some immense communicational and computer network are themselves but a distorted figuration of something deeper, namely the whole world system of present-day multinational capitalism'

book attempting to describe "the sublime encounter between contemporary literature and science" (Tabbi x)

sees answer to question -- "with the loss of an absolute standard of reality (assuming such a standard ever existed), and in the absence of metaphysical foundations and former certainties (including the certainty that there is a 'nature' that can be represented), have science and technology themselves become means -- however 'painfully inadequate' -- of presenting the unpresentable, the mind's relation to [Lyotard's] 'totality of what is'?" (Tabbi x-xi) -- in postmodern fiction as being YES

Mailer, Pynchon, Joseph McElroy, DeLillo, cyberpunk

"Like the technological aesthetic it takes as its subject, this book has been of necessity eclectic in its methods, ad hoc and even tendentious in bringing together narrative elements that may well be incompatible" (Tabbi xi)
