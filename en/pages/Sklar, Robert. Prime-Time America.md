Sklar, Robert.  Prime-Time America: Life On and Behind the Television Screen.  New York: Oxford University Press, 1980.


PREFACE

current tendency is to analyze television as spectacle; thinks that “the medium may better be understood as a cultural process — a process by which cultural products are created and transmitted to viewers, who use them, of course, in ways not necessarily intended or predicted.” (Sklar x)

PART ONE: CULTURE AND VALUES ON TELEVISION

1. PRIME-TIME AMERICA

“What you want is a moderate amount of mayhem and murder, a soupçon of titillation, and a square-jawed stance of moral uplift.  It’s as American as baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet, and you can only get it these days on television.” (Sklar 4)

old-fashioned moralizing

2. THE FONZ, LAVERNE, SHIRLEY, AND THE GREAT AMERICAN CLASS STRUGGLE

working-class characters not buffoons, for the first time; aware of their own class position

working class has “a firmer grasp on the moral verities” than middle class (Sklar 17)

“Let’s begin with the well-known dictum that the purpose of network television is to sell audiences to advertisers.  The larger an audience a network can deliver — or, in these more sophisticated times, the larger an audience of defined demographic characteristics, such as age and income — the more it may charge for commercial time, the higher its profits.  Ergo, the networks want to program shows that will attract audiences and not drive them away to bed, book, or bottle.” (Sklar 19)

shift in popular taste? why are sitcoms suddenly showing hostility between classes rather than escape? — does watching a working class character struggle and succeed encourage perseverance?

“It seems important that an expression of moral strength on sit-coms not involve personal sacrifice.” (Sklar 21)

15. TWELVE TELEVISION REVIEWS

“By now it is fairly clear that there are significant differences between the ways audiences perceive performers in motion pictures and in television.  The most successful movie stars have been actors whose private personalities project into the roles they are playing.  They are real people first, fictional characters second. . . . With television performers it’s different.  Perhaps because of screen size or image definition, perhaps because of the weekly-series format, the character becomes more prominent than the actor.” (Sklar 193)

“In movies, audiences feel intimacy by identifying with the performers on the screen, but that seldom happens in television.  Instead, television performers say to their viewers: We are separate, but we are in this together” (Sklar 197)
