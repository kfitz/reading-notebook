Shirky, Clay. Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations. New York: The Penguin Press, 2008.


Chapter 1: It Takes a Village to Find a Phone

"Human beings are social creatures -- not occasionally or by accident but always.... Society is not just the product of its individual members; it is also the product of its constituent groups." (Shirky 14)

"In theory, since humans have a gift for mutually beneficial cooperation, we should be able to assemble as needed to take on tasks too big for one person.  If this were true, anything that required shared effort -- whether policing, road construction, or garbage collection -- would simply arise out of the motivations of the individual members.  In practices, the difficulties of coordination prevent that from happening." (Shirky 18-19)

"Tools that provide simple ways of creating groups lead to new groups, lots of new groups, and not just more groups but more kinds of groups." (Shirky 20)

"If we're so good at social life and shared effort, what advantages are these tools creating?... We now have communications tools that are flexible enough to match our social capabilities, and we are witnessing the rise of new ways of coordinating action that take advantage of that change." (Shirky 20)

"we are living in the middle of a remarkable increase in our ability to share, to cooperate with one another, and to take collective action, all outside the framework of traditional institutions and organizations." (Shirky 20-21)

"most of the barriers to group action have collapsed, and without those barriers, we are free to explore new ways of gathering together and getting things done." (Shirky 22)

"Though some of the early utopianism around new communications tools suggested that we were heading into some sort of posthierarchical paradise, that's not what's happening now, and it's not what's going to happen." (Shirky 23)


Chapter 2: Sharing Anchors Community

"The distinction between Flickr coordinating users versus helping them coordinate themselves seems minor, but it is in fact vital, as it is the only way Flickr can bear the costs involved." (Shirky 33)

"The basic capabilities of tools like Flickr reverse the old order of group activity, transforming 'gather, then share" into "share, then gather.'" (Shirky 35)

"We now have communications tools -- and increasingly, social patterns that make use of those tools -- that are a better fit for our native desires and talents for group effort.  Because we can now reach beneath the Coasean floor, we can have groups that operate with a birthday party's informality and a multinational's scope." (Shirky 48)

"Knowingly sharing your work with others is the simplest way to take advantage of the new social tools." (Shirky 49)

"Conversation creates more of a sense of community than sharing does, but it also introduces new problems." (Shirky 50)

"Structurally, the biggest difference between information sharing and collaborative production is that in collaborative production at least some collective decisions have to be made." (Shirky 50)

"Information sharing produces shared awareness among the participants, and collaborative production relies on shared creation, but collective action creates shared responsibility, by tying the user's identity to the identity of the group." (Shirky 51)

"For a group to take collective action, it must have some shared vision strong enough to bind the group together, despite periodic decisions that will inevitably displease at least some members.  For this reason collective action is harder to arrange than information sharing or collaborative creation." (Shirky 53)


Chapter 3: Everyone Is a Media Outlet

"A profession exists to solve a hard problem, one that requires some sort of specialization.... Most professions exist because there is a scarce resource that requires ongoing management... In these cases, the scarcity of the resource itself creates the need for a professional class... In these cases professionals become gatekeepers, simultaneously providing and controlling access to information, entertainment, communication, or other ephemeral goods." (Shirky 57)

"Much of the time the internal consistency of professional judgment is a good thing -- not only do we want high standards of education and competence, we want those standards created and enforced by other members of the same profession, a structure that is almost the definition of professionalism.  Sometimes, though, the professional outlook can become a disadvantage, preventing the very people who have the most at stake -- the professionals themselves -- from understanding major changes to the structure of their profession." (Shirky 58)

"It is easier to understand that you face competition than obsolescence." (Shirky 59)

"The media industries have suffered first and most from the recent collapse in communications costs.  It used to be hard to move words, images, and sounds from creator to consumer, and most media businesses involve expensive and complex management of that pipeline problem, whether running a printing press or a record label.  In return for helping overcome these problems, media businesses got to exert considerable control over the media and extract considerable revenues from the public.  The commercial viability of most media businesses involves providing those solutions, so preservation of the original problems became an economic imperative." (Shirky 59)

"The Web didn't introduce a new competitor into the old ecosystem, as *USA Today* had done.  The Web created a new ecosystem." (Shirky 60)

"In a world where a dozen editors, all belonging to the same professional class, can decide whether to run or kill a national story, information that might be of interest to the general public may not be published, not because of a conspiracy but because the editors have a professional bias that is aligned by the similar challenges they face and by the similar tools they use to approach those challenges." (Shirky 65)

"A scribe, someone who has given his life over to literacy as a cardinal virtue, would be conflicted about the meaning of movable type.  After all, if books are good, the surely more books are better.  But at the same time the very scarcity of literacy was what gave scribal effort its primacy, and the scribal way of life was based on this scarcity." (Shirky 67)

"real revolutions don't involve an orderly transition from point A to point B.  Rather, they go from A through a long period of chaos and only then reach B.  In that chaotic period, the old systems get broken long before new ones become stable." (Shirky 68)

"There is never going to be a moment when we as a society ask ourselves, 'Do we want this? Do we want the changes that the new flood of production and access and spread of information is going to bring about?'  It has already happened; in many ways the rise of group-forming networks is best viewed not as an invention but as an event, a thing that has happened in the world that can't be undone." (Shirky 73)

"Publishing used to require access to a printing press, and as a result the act of publishing something was limited to a tiny fraction of the population, and reaching a population outside a geographically limited area was even more restricted.  Now, once a user connects to the internet, he has access to a platform that is at once global and free.  It isn't just that our communications tools are cheaper; they are also better." (Shirky 77)


Chapter 4: Publish, Then Filter

"Surveying this vast collection of personal postings, in-joke photographs, and poorly shot video, it's easy to conclude that, while the old world of scarcity may [have] had some disadvantages, it spared us the worst of amateur production." (Shirky 83)

"When people talk about user-generated content, they are describing the ways that users create and share media with one another, with no professionals anywhere in sight.  Seen this way, the idea of user-generated content is actually not just a personal theory of creative capabilities but a social theory of media relations." (Shirky 83-84)

"Most user-generation content is created as communication in small groups, but since we're so unused to communications media and broadcast media being mixed together, we think that everyone is now broadcasting.  This is a mistake." (Shirky 87)

"The Web makes interactivity technologically possible, but what technology giveth, social factors taketh away." (Shirky 91)

"The surprise held out by social tools like weblogs is that scale alone, even in a medium that allows for two-way connections, is enough to create and sustain the imbalance of fame.... Egalitarianism is possible only in small social systems.  Once a medium gets past a certain size, fame is a forced move." (Shirky 93)

"It turns out the difference between conversational tools and broadcast tools was arbitrary, but the difference between conversing and broadcasting is real.  Even in a medium that allowed for perfect interactivity for all participants (something we have a reasonable approximation of today), the limits of human cognition will mean that scale alone will kill conversation." (Shirky 95-96)

"there is an upper limit to the number of books, or television shows, or movies that can exist.  Simply to remain viable, anyone producing traditional media has to decide what to produce and what not to; the good work has to be sorted from the mediocre in advance of publication." (Shirky 97)

"Though the filtering of the good from the mediocre starts as an economic imperative, the public enjoys the value of that filtering as well, because we have historically relied on the publisher's judgment to help ensure minimum standards of quality." (Shirky 97)

"The old ways of filtering were neither universal nor ideal; they were simply good for the technology of the day, and reasonable effective." (Shirky 98)

"Mass amateurization of publishing makes mass amateurization of filtering a forced move.  Filter-then-publish, whatever its advantages, rested on a scarcity of media that is a thing of the past.  The expansion of social media means that the only working system is publish-then-filter." (Shirky 98)

"As the author and activist Cory Doctorow puts it, 'Conversation is king. Content is just something to talk about.'" (Shirky 99)

"Our social tools are not an improvement to modern society; they are a challenge to it.  New technology makes new things possible: put another way, when new technology appears, previously impossible things start occurring." (Shirky 107)


Chapter 5: Personal Motivation Meets Collaborative Production

on power-law distribution of participation in social media: "There are two big surprises here.  The first is that the imbalance is the same shape across a huge number of different kinds of behaviors.... The second surprise is that the imbalance drives large social systems rather than damaging them." (Shirky 124-25)

"Yochai Benkler, a legal scholar and network theorist and author of *The Wealth of Networks*, calls nonmarket creation of group value 'commons-based peer production' and draws attention to the ways people are happy to cooperate without needing financial reward." (Shirky 133)

"Wikipedia is predicated on openness not as a theoretical way of working but as a practical one.  This pragmatism often comes as a shock to people who hold up Wikipedia as a beacon of pure openness, but the curious fact is that many of Wikipedia's most vociferous boosters actually don't know much about its inner workings and want to regard it, wrongly, as an experiment in communal anarchy.... It is the product not of collectivism but of unending argumentation." (Shirky 138-39)

"Our social tools are turning love into a renewable building material.  When people care enough, they can come together and accomplish things of a scope and longevity that were previously impossible; they can do big things for love." (Shirky 142)


Chapter 6: Collective Action and Institutional Challenges

"What we are witnessing today is a difference in the degree of sharing so large it becomes a difference in kind." (Shirky 149)

"This is a common event among organizations that grow quickly: they factor in the rapid growth, and when it slows, as it inevitably much past a certain size, they feel the pinch.  With many more possible groups competing for the average individual's time, the speed with which a group can come unglued has also increased." (Shirky 152)

"social tools don't create collective action -- they merely remove the obstacles to it." (Shirky 159)


Chapter 7: Faster and Faster

"Collective action is different from individual action, both harder to get going and, once going, harder to stop." (Shirky 161)

flash mob protests, passenger rights groups, etc.


Chapter 8: Solving Social Dilemmas

"This is what the end of cyberspace looks like: the popularity of these Meetup groups suggests that meeting online isn't enough and that after communicating with one another using these various services, the members become convinced that they share enough to want to get together in the real world." (Shirky 198-99)

"Meetup didn't end up recreating the old model of community, because it provided a different set of capabilities; the groups that took first and best advantage of those capabilities were the groups with a latent desire to meet but had faced previously insuperable hurdles." (Shirky 200)

"When society is changing, we want to know whether the change is good or bad, but that kind of judgment becomes meaningless with transformations this large." (Shirky 207)

"Our new freedoms are not without their problems; it's not a revolution if nobody loses.  Improved freedom of assembly is creating three kinds of social loss.  The first and most obvious loss is to people whose jobs relied on solving a formerly hard problem.  This is the effect felt by media outlets challenged by mass amateurization." (Shirky 209)

"The second kind of loss will damage current social bargains.  Many countries place restrictions on the media in the run-up to elections, but this raises the question of who 'the media' is today and what controls should be put on them." (Shirky 209)

"The third kind of loss is the most serious.  Networked organizations are more resilient as a result of better communications tools and more flexible social structures, but this is as true of terrorist networks or criminal gangs as of Wikipedians or student protesters." (Shirky 210)

"When it is hard to form groups, both potentially good and bad groups are prevented from forming; when it becomes simple to form groups, we get both the good and bad ones.  This is going to force society to shift from simply preventing groups from forming to actively deciding which existing ones to try to oppose, a shift that parallels the publish-then-filter pattern generally." (Shirky 211)


Chapter 9: Fitting Our Tools to a Small World

"small world" networks as densely connected subnetworks linked via a few highly connected individuals

bonding capital vs. bridging capital


Chapter 10: Failure for Free

"The advantage of having a system where failure is normal and significant success rare is that, by its very existence, Meetup continually readjusts to its current context." (Shirky 235)

Eric Raymond, "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"

"it would be a mistake to assume that because Linux is an open source project, all open source projects are like Linux.  In fact, when we look closely at the open source ecosystem, the picture that emerges is characterized more by failure than by success." (Shirky 244)

"Open source is a profound threat, not because the open source ecosystem is outsucceeding commercial efforts but because it is outfailing them.  Because the open source ecosystem, and by extension open social systems generally, rely on peer production, the work on those systems can be considerably more experimental, at considerably less cost, than any firm can afford." (Shirky 245)

"Open source doesn't reduce the likelihood of failure, it reduces the cost of failure; it essentially gets failure for free." (Shirky 246)

"Cheap failure, valuable as it is on its own, is also a key part of a more complex advantage: the exploration of multiple possibilities." (Shirky 247)

"the respective costs of filtering versus publishing have reversed.  In the traditional world, the cost of publishing anything creates not just an incentive but a requirement to filter the good from the bad in advance.  In the open source world, trying something is often cheaper than making a formal decision about whether to try it." (Shirky 249)


Chapter 11: Promise, Tool, Bargain

"Every story in this book relies on a successful fusion of a plausible promise, an effective tool, and an acceptable bargain with the users.  The promise is the basic 'why' for anyone to join or contribute to a group.  The tool helps with the 'how' -- how will the difficulties of coordination be overcome, or at least be held to manageable levels?  And the bargain sets the rules of the road: if you are interested in the promise and adopt the tools, what can you expect, and what will be expected of you?" (Shirky 260)

"The implicit promise of any given group matters more than any explicit one, which is to say that the stated rationale of the group is not necessarily the lived one." (Shirky 262)

"Wikis take on one of the most basic questions of political philosophy: Who will guard the guardians? Their answer is, everyone." (Shirky 272).


Epilogue

"The advantages and disadvantages of mass amateurization are a judgment call; people who dislike the current increase in mediocre writing or photos or video can simply declare those things to be worse than any advantages that come from the democratization of production, or from the surprisingly good work that comes from the most talented amateurs.  Arguments about whether new forms of sharing or collaboration are, on balance, good or bad reveal more about the speaker than the subject." (Shirky 297)
