Introduction

Katie Hafner, "Books to Bytes: The Electronic Archive," NYT 8 April 1999.

Peter Lyman and Brewster Kahle, "Archiving Digital Cultural Artifacts," D-Lib, July-August 1998

Larry Masinter, March 1996, "Stuff Goes Away":  "No amount of handle-servering link-trackering will deal with the problem that frequently there is no organized institutional archive of useful digital material.  Information preservation requires building a structure that lasts longer than the mean time between site failure." (qtd on Lazinger xvii)

"OCLC, the bibliographic-utility-cum-publisher of /Electronic Collections Online/, published a statement of commitment to providing libraries with permanent access to all electronic journals they have ever subscribed to, even if the library cancels the subscription.  OCLC, however, is essentially one of us: an organization that originated in the library world and that is sensitive to the needs of libraries in a way not all commercial publishers are." (Lazinger xvii)

Donald Waters, "Archiving Digital Information" (http://www.oclc.org/oclc/man/968Orldc/waters1.htm)

"Original digital objects -- what the /New York Times/ article refers to as 'born-digital' resources -- however, are at the most risk if long-term strategies for their preservation are not carefully developed and carried out, for they *have* no other format stored away somewhere in a museum, library, or archive." (Lazinger xx)


Chapter 1: Why Is Digital Preservation an Issue?

Jian Zhao in an article on digital watermarking:  "Why is it so difficult to find a needle in a haystack? Because of the size of the needle relative to the size of the haystack." (qtd on Lazinger 5) -- sure, but also because of the relative similarity between the size and shape of the needle and the size and shape of one element of the haystack; it's not just how much is there, but how to distinguish difference in what's there

"Electronic texts, so easy to edit, manipulate, revise, and improve, have lost their assurance of permanence.  We no longer know whether what we are seeing online, on the Web, is the same document we saw at the same URL yesterday or, for that matter, half an hour ago.  The marvelous flexibility that electronic publishing has afforded us has at the same time pulled the rug out from under our ability to document our research reliably" (Lazinger 6)

distinction between fragility of medium and fragility of data; inadvertent damage that can be done through mistakes in manipulation, corruption in transfer


Chapter 2: What Electronic Data Should Be Preserved?

five components of digital documents: content, fixity, reference, provenance, context

"uniform resource locator" or URL suffers from lack of fixity; contrast with theoretical URN (uniform resource name) which would be permanent, or PURL (persistent uniform resource locator); also DOI (digital object identifier), referred to as "the ISBN for the 21st century" (qtd on Lazinger 23)

preservation of context/linkage: "the way or ways in which digital information objects interact with elements in the wider digital environment" (Lazinger 25)


Chapter 3: Who Should Be Responsible for Digital Preservation?

various stakeholders all involved: authors, publishers, distributors, sysadmins, libraries, archives, users, universities, governments, etc.

see OCLC, CLIR

librarians and archives approach preservation differently; librarians tend to preserve non-unique objects for public use, while archivists tend to preserve unique objects against public use

LOCKSS: "A prototype system to preserve access to scientific journals published on the Web by enabling libraries to take custody of a copy of a Web journal, cache it, and assure continuing access whether or not it is available from the original publisher" (Lazinger 69)

LOCKSS focuses on circulating collections rather than archival preservation; see Vicky Reich, http://www.rlg.org/events/pres-2000/reich.html 


Chapter 4: How Can Electronic Publications Be Preserved?

the problem of technological obsolescence via the evolution of technology, media deterioration, software obsolescence, etc; solutions through refreshing, migration, emulation

"preserving access rather than the object or medium" -- but can you really make that separation cleanly in digital publishing?

migration strategies:  less stable to more stable media; highly software-dependent formats to less software-intensive formats; multiplicity of formats to smaller number of common formats; development of backward compatibility paths; standard development and imposition; development of process centers for migration and reformatting

issues surrounding emulation

ensuring authenticity of preserved documents; taxonomy of changes to documents; modes of authentication

copyright issues


Chapter 5: How Much Will It Cost?

"Estimating the costs of these processes is complex, both because the processes are complex and because the cost of each element in the processes varies as a result of many factors." (Lazinger 111)

"Interestingly, a number of projects have shown that digital imagine itself only accounts for about one-third of the overall cost of imaging projects, with metadata creation often being as or more expensive than the physical conversion of materials into digital objects." (Lazinger 111)
