Introduction: New Hope for the Hares

page 1: underlined "A consensus emerged that the U.S. was a graying and gullible nation, slipping into churlish senility, and that Japan was a mercantilist shyster, seizing power by predatory trade."

page 2: underlined "20-year, multibillion-dollar effort in high-definition television (HDTV). The next generation of television equipment, HDTV could offer a large 3- by 5-foot flat-panel screen that you could hang on the wall like a picture. You might even mistake it for a window, its images would be so true to life. The new television, full of microchips and other advanced electronics, would function like a state-of-the-art video computer that would not only present pictures but reshape and manipulate them as well. With appropriate peripherals, such as color printers and editing systems, HDTV would transform an array of related industries, from still photography and movies to medical diagnostics and missile defense."; in margin: "HDTV" (underscored)

page 4: underlined "I had written in /Microcosm/ that television, in technical terms, was dead. Now, industry leaders are solemnly presenting high-definition television as the new hope of the future."
-- underlined "the microchip will reshape not only the television and computer industries but also the telecommunications industry and all other information services."
-- underlined "The downfall of television turns out to be only the most visible symbol of a series of cascading changes that will engulf the world in the 1990s."

page 5: underlined "U.S. will first have to understand why television has for so long dominated the world's entertainment and culture, and why it has now become obsolete."

Chapter 1: The Rise and Fall of Television

page 7: underlined "vacuum tubes"

page 8: underlined "No one predicted that in a few decades 98 percent of all American households would own a television set, exceeding the level of telephone ownership by five percentage points, and by a far larger margin in the homes of the poor. No one anticipated that the members of an average household would watch the screen some six hours a day, while in poor homes television would become a substitute hearth, glowing constantly day and night. Few people foresaw that television, more than any other force, would provide the unifying images that would define the national experience and consciousness."
-- marginal line beside "Television marched into America's living rooms and took over for 50 years. First it transformed childhood into Howdy Doody time, adolescence into puberty rites with Elvis Presley and the Beatles, and politics into news bites on the networks. Television took us to Little Rock, Arkansas, and Birmingham, Alabama, blessing the civil rights movmement for two decades. It cast infamy on Orval Faubus and Bull Connor and beatified Martin Luther King, contributing heavily to the passage of new laws against discrimination. For three decades television exalted feminism and other forms of sexual liberation. [MY NOTE: REALLY???] TV took us to Dallas and made John F. Kennedy into a national icon. It took us to the moon. It awakened us to the horrors of war in Vietnam. It made a few hundred corpses on Beijing's Tiananmen Square loom larger in the American mind than the many millions of deaths that occurred under the rule of Chairman Mao Tse-tung."; written in margin: "Inflated quote on TV's influence"

page 9: underlined: "TV received a readier welcome in households than the cheaper telephone because it offered a better yield for the money. In terms of access to news and entertainment, television made the poorest of American families far richer than kings and tycoons of old."; written in margin: "Not cheaper"

page 10: underlined: "The television age is giving way to the much richer, interactive technologies of the computer age."
-- GREEN marginal line beside "To fully understand why the original technologies were so rapidly outmoded, we must first understand the basic science behind them."
-- underlined: "For decades, television systems operated mainly through the use of vacuum tubes, which are sealed and evacuated glass"
-- underlined: "Sending the signals requires the use of a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called radio frequencies, which are highly vulnerable to interference in the atmosphere."
-- written in margin: "How Radiowaves work!" (underscored), with circled drawing:
     ''''''' m
     ------- e
      '''''' m
      ------ e
      '''''  m
      -----
        e
(small arrow drawn to circled drawing from "makes long-distance TV transmission possible")

page 11: marginal line beside: "These relatively high frequencies are called colors. Sound and color frequencies cannot be broadcast long distances for use in television. THey must be translated into the radio-frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. These frequencies, capable of being sent long distances, occupy parts of the spectrum between the waves of sound and color."; written in margin: "TV frequencies fall between sound and color"
-- underlined: "These frequencies reside in what we call 'the air,' which is usable for radio and television broadcasting, cellular phones, air phones, pagers, and other mobile technologies. Higher frequencies, with billions of waves per second (gigahertz), can be used for direct-broadcast satellite transmission."
-- underlined (and GREEN marginal line beside): "These technologies dictated that television would be a top-down system -- in electronic terms, a 'master-slave' architecture. A few broad-"

page 12: underlined (and GREEN marginal line beside): "cast centers would originate programs for millions of passive receivers, or 'dumb terminals'."
-- underlined: "This meant that TV would have to be an analog system, since analog waves directly simulate sound, brightness, and color.//The advantage of analog systems is efficiency; the entire wave is used to carry, imitate, and display the signal."; written in margin: "Analog waves"
-- underlined (and GREEN marginal line beside): "Several inventions, however, dislodged the key props of the television age. The invention of the transistor in 1948, the microchip in 1958, and the fiber-optic cable in the late 1970s made the top-down broadcast structure, with most of the intelligence at the station, obsolete."

page 13: underlined (and partial GREEN marginal line beside): "the microchip industry spawned an unending series of innovations that would doom all top-down broadcasting systems. With millions -- yes, millions -- of vacuum-tube equivalents printed on single slivers of silicon costing less than one dollar to make, cheap video receivers in the 1990s would no longer have to be dumb or dependent on distant stations for processing power."
-- underlined: "It could create, perfect, process, store, and even transmit signals on its own."
-- underlined (and GREEN marginal line beside): "Intelligence could move from the broadcast station into inexpensive home-based personal computers."

page 14: written in margin at top of page: "Fiber-optics & digitals" (underscored)
-- marginal line beside: "The advent of microchip technology was well timed, because even the air began to give out. With the rapid spread of mobile technologies led by the nearly ubiquitous cellular phones, the air became a valuable and limited resource. The Motorola-Timex wristwatch-pager, which displays the number and identity of the caller, portends an ultimate vision of the wristwatch telephone, with everyone using spectrum for personal communication."; written in margin: "Spectrum starting to be used for personal communications" (underscored)
-- underlined: "But in the 1980s, just as the microchip had transformed the dimensions of electronics, fiber optics reshaped the possibilities of all media. The limitations of the air, and even of the coaxial copper wires that carry cable television, gave way to the unlimited bandwidth of lasers and glass. Fiber-optic glass wires the width of a human hair could potentially bear billions or even trillions of characters of information per second."; written in margin: "Fiber-optics transforms media bandwidth" (underscored)
-- underlined (with some GREEN marks in margins): "These data were digital in form, which meant that all the... Digital signals have an advantage over analog signals in that they can be stored and manipulated without deteriorating. These signals could potentially be switched through two-way telephone networks, collected on new kinds of memories resembling compact discs, and processed and displayed by personal computers. A huge variety of programs could be dispatched over fiber lines. A small box of disks by the desk could hold whole libraries of pay-per-view video entertainment, art, and information."

page 17: underlined: "By that measure, the mostly analog 'idiot box' and videocassette tape player were as passé as last century's icebox and icewagon."
-- underlined (with GREEN double marginal line beside): "The new system will be the telecomputer, a personal computer adapted for video processing and connected by fiber-optic threads to other telecomputers all around the world. Using a two-way system of signals like telephones do, rather than broadcasting one-way like TV, the telecomputer will surpass the television in video communication just as the telephone surpassed the telegraph in verbal communication."
-- underlined: "Some 40 million personal computers -- half the world's total number of PCs -- now reside in US worksites and homes."
-- marginal bracket around (and small GREEN mark beside): "In presenting one-way news and entertainment, telecomputers can already do anything that present-day televisions can do. But they will soon offer a plethora of new computer functions. Telecomputers have interactive powers, from voice-controlled video to image creation and retrieval, that are inherently impossible in an analog broadcast medium."; written in margin: "Telecomputer advantages"

page 18: underlined: "The telecomputer may even reverse the effects of the television age."
-- underlined (with GREEN marginal line beside): "Rather than exalting mass culture, the telecomputer will enhance individualism. Rather than cultivating passivity, the telecomputer will promote creativity. Instead of a master-slave architecture, the telecomputer will have an interactive architecture in which every receiver can function as a processor and transmitter of video images and other information. The telecomputer will usher in a new culture compatible with the immense powers of today's ascendant technology."
-- underlined: "Yet television is at its heart a totalitarian medium. Because television signals originate at a single station and are sent top-down to the masses, tyrants everywhere push TV sets onto their people."

page 19: CIRCLED paragraph, with part underlined: "/Full-motion video and high-fidelity audio are by far the most powerful media tools ever invented by man. They simply overwhelm all other media./  But to use them today, the artist usually has to make a Faustian deal. He must give up his individuality and creativity. He must bow to the lowest terms of mass appeal. Then he must join the queue for access to the limited number of video-entertainment channels.  /Television acts as a severe bottleneck to creative expression, driving thousands of American writers and creators into formulaic banality or near-pornographic pandering./"
-- underlined: "most TV writers merely fill in the blanks of formatted shows, contriving shocks and sensations to satisfy a mass audience. The entertainment industry pays them well, not to create innovative programming, but to endlessly work and rework a few proven themes."
-- underlined with marginal bracket: "On the fringes of the television and film industries, however, American creativity is beginning to burst forth through VCRs, cable, low-power channels, public-television programs, low-budget movies, and a huge variety of new computer software. In text, where the impact of digital technology came first and most fully, desktop-publishing programs have generated tens of thousands of new publishing ventures such as special-interest magazines. These developments offer the merest glimpse of the possibilities of digital video. Released from the restrictions of mass media, American culture could attain new levels in both the visual arts and literature."
-- underlined: "Television is not vulgar because people are vulgar; it is vulgar because people are similar in"

page 20: underlined: "their prurient interests and sharply differentiated in their civilized concerns. All of world industry is moving increasingly toward more segmented markets. But in a broadcast medium, such a move would be a commercial disaster. In a broadcast medium, artists and writers cannot appeal to the highest aspirations and sensibilities of individuals. Instead, manipulative masters rule over huge masses"

Chapter 2: The Age of the Telecomputer

page 23: underlined: "Sand in the form of silica fibers is used in photonics, the technology of transmitting and switching light through strands of glass, or fiber-optic cables."
-- underlined: "the maze becomes more dense, with millions of tiny devices concentrated on a single microchip, it will enable telecomputers to summon and shape images with resolution far exceeding current film technology or future high-definition television."

page 24: marginal marks in black and GREEN (green bits are odd possibilities for video interactions, including family visits, etc)
-- underlined in GREEN: "Visit your family on the other side of the world with moving pictures hardly distinguishable from real-life images. Have your doctor make house calls without leaving his office. Give a birthday party for Grandma at her nursing home in FLorida, bringing her descendants from all over the country to the foot of her bed in vivid living color. Watch movies or television programs"

page 25: underlined: "A crystalline web of glass and light, manufactured and installed by American businesses and workers, will soon stretch across the U.S."
-- underlined: "From the personal computer to the fiber-optic cable, from the communications satellite to the compact disc, our generation commands the most powerful information tools in history. Yet the culture we have created with these machines is dreary at best. Why doesn't our superb information technology better inform and uplift us? // This is the most important question of the age. The most dangerous threat to the U.S. economy and society is the breakdown of our cultural institutions -- in the family, religion, education, and the arts -- that preserve and transmit civilization to new generations. If this social fabric continues to fray, we will lose not only our technological prowess and economic competitiveness but also the meaning of life itself. The chief economic challenge we now face is how to apply the new technologies in a way that preserves the values and disciplines that made them possible in the first place."; written in margin: "CONSERVATIVE" (underscored in Z formation!)

page 26: underlined: "No fiscal or monetary policy, however brilliant, will be able to promote enduring economic growth and competitiveness in a society in which children spend four hours a day wallowing in the nihilistic swamp of television. Families and schools cannot succeed unless our culture upholds moral codes and disciplines and hard regiments of study. In the U.S., culture means TV. It means an endless flow of minor titillations with barely a major idea or ideal. The culture propogated by TV and other media is perhaps economically exogenous, but it is central to what happens to the economy."
-- underlined: "domonetics" (merger of domicile, connections, and electronics)
-- underlined: "Domonetics focuses on flows of communication. Rather than identifying hierarchies, counting units, and defining boundaries -- as economics does -- domonetics stresses social and technological connections."
-- underlined: "From telephones and televisions to computers and telecomputers -- linked by wires and switches, fields and forces -- information technology is the central nervous system of the domonetic world. It is the defining activity of modern man and American society. We live inside our televisions, computers, and telephones as much as we live inside our homes."

page 27: underlined: "television system"
-- underlined: "Newton Minow"

page 28: underlined (with marginal bracket around): "In all networks of wires and switches, except for those on the microchip, complexity tends to grow exponentially as the number of interconnections rises. This rule applies to national computer networks, to telephone connections, even to interactions in a national economic plan. In all such cases, the multiplication of interconnections and switches rapidly reaches a level of exploding complexity that the human mind, even aided by computers, is unable to reduce to a manageable order."; written in margin: "DeLillo"
-- written in margin: "Child at party" (underscored; next to description of Penzias analogy for rising complexity)
-- underlined: "This phenomenon of exponentially growing complexity could be called the law of the macrocosm. In Newtonian physics, it is often called the many-body problem. While computing the interactions between a small number of planets or other physical entities is feasible, computing a large number causes what is called a combinatorial explosion."
-- underlined: "In the microcosm, efficiency, not complexity, grows as the square of the number of interconnections, or switches, to be organized."

page 31: underlined: "Electronics works best when the movements of electrons approach their geodesic -- the shortest possible distance they can travel without colliding with the crystalline structure of the silicon. On the microchip, the immense precision and speed of infinitesimal quantum phenomena can countervail the friction, resistance, entropy, and chaotic movement of all visible things."; written in margin: "Geodesic" (underlined)
-- underlined: "At present, the smallest controlled movements of electrons on microchips are hundreds of times longer than their geodesic. This leaves huge and perhaps ever-growing room for progress in microelectronics."
-- underlined: "The coming era, therefore, will be one of single microchip systems. More and more processing power will devolve to particular slivers of silicon running individual personal computers. More and more authority will slip from the tops of hierarchies onto the desktops of individual entrepreneurs and engineers."
-- written in margin (next to "In contrast to a hierarchy ruled from the top, a heterarchy is a society of equals under the law."): "And how will law be enforced, you smug prick?"

page 32: marginal line beside paragraph: "Switches are the source of machine intelligence --\> or local TV stations, are all vulnerable."

page 33: underlined in GREEN (with marginal bracket around): "A healthy culture reflects not the psychology of crowds but the creativity and inspiration of millions of individuals reaching for high foals. In place of the broadcast pyramid, a peer network will emerge in which all the terminals will be smart -- not mere television sets but interactive video receivers, processors, and transmitters."
-- marginal line beside: "The telecomputer could revitalize public education by bringing the best teachers in the country to classrooms everywhere. More important, the telecomputer could encourage competition because it could make home schooling both feasible and attractive. To learn social skills, neighborhood children could gather in micro-schools run by parents, churches, or other local institutions. The competition of home schooling would either destroy the public school system or force it to become competitive with rival systems, including those in Asia that now set the global standard."; written in margin: "Quixotic vision of TC's helping education"
-- underlined in GREEN (with marginal line beside paragraph): "With telecomputers in every home attached to a global fiber network, why would anyone commute? People would be able to see the boss life-size in high-definition video and meet with him as easily at home as at the office."; written in margin: "STAY HOME"

page 34: marginal bracket around: "But they could also go comfortably sightseeing from their living rooms through high-resolution screens, visiting third-world countries without having to worry about exchange rates or air fares"; written in margin: "Is this cold? scary?"
-- underlined: "By radically changing the balance of power between the distributors and creators of culture, the telecomputer will forever break the broadcast bottleneck. Potentially, there will be as many channels as there are computers attached to the global network."

page 35: underlined (with GREEN marginal parenthesis and check mark): "He will be able to command a large audience without worrying about mass appeal. The medium will change from a mass-produced and mass-consumed commodity to an endless feast of niches and specialities."; written in margin: "So where is community? Everyone stays home, everyone does his own thing."

page 36: underlined: "A new age of individualism is coming, and it will bring an eruption of culture unprecedented in human history. Every film will be able to reach cheaply a potential audience of hundreds of millions of people around the world. For major movie releases, we may even be able to return to the era of the 25-cent premiere. For films appealing to elites, the price will be higher but below that of current movie tickets. Lower prices will expand the ranks of creators and the audiences. The upsurge in artistic output will enhance the position of the United States as the center of video production and creation. We will discover that television was a technology with supreme powers but deadly flaws. In the beginning the powers were ascendant; now the flaws dominate. The cultural limitations of television, tolerable when there was no alternative, are unendurable in the face of the new computer technologies now on the horizon -- technologies in which, happily the U.S. leads the world."
-- underlined (with GREEN marginal line beside): "Television manufacturers around the world are holding out the promise of what they call high-definition television, which is the old spud-farm medium dressed up with a bigger screen and sharper pictures."

page 37: small marginal mark beside "Perhaps the first industry to fall before the domonetic tide will be the centralized on-line database."

Chapter 3: The Case of the Hurtling Haystack

page 40: marginal line beside: "This overwhelming trend means that the world of electronics is full of zombie systems. Most people imagine that these electronic systems are young and thriving -- even futuristic -- when in fact they are in the process of protracted decline. Along with broadcast television, the pyramids of cable TV, mainframe computing, mass manufacturing, and the centralized telephone system are facing decline or even extinction."
-- written in margin: "Data Bases" (underlined)

page 42: marginal line beside: "In domonetic terms, the problem Sprague encountered with Dialog was simple. Dialog is a centralized network run by a mainframe. It puts the brains at the top of the hierarchy and treats the customer like a dumb terminal. Everywhere in the new domonetic world, the brains were moving to the"; written in margin: "Data Bases are like TV, centralized, pyramidical, active-to-dumb"

page 43: bracket around: "In a deeper sense, however, the chairman of National had come face-to-face with the central problem of the information age. Computers multiply data; in fact, one study indicates that data will double 19 times before the year 2000. How will anyone be able to find the information he needs in this huge haystack?"
-- written in margin: "Eliot quote" (beside a quote from Eliot, duh)
-- underlined: "No one denies that the immense gains in the power of computers have yet to yield similar advances in the power of people to find and use information."

page 44: underlined: "Database expert Alfred Glossbrenner, author of /How to Look it up Online/, declares, 'You don't have to spend much time perusing the rate cards of the various vendors to realize that the information industry hasn't the slightest idea how to price its products.'"; written in margin: "Book - /How to Look it up OnLine/"
-- written in margin: "PROBLEMS WITH DATA BASES"

page 47: written in margin: "QuoTrek: EASY TO FIND WHAT YOU WANT" (underscored; arrow drawn to): "This tuner was practically a toy compared with today's scanners. Sprague knew that more advanced microprocessors (computers on microchips) could scan much greater streams of more varied information -- whole hurtling haystances of data. A company could broadcast information in large quantities and let customers scan it on the fly at their desks. Together, the two sidebands of one FM station could transmit 100 million words of data a day, or about the content of 1,000 full-length books. This would be like transmitting almost one book every minute and a half all day long and searching them for key words: a rate that is well within the capacity of current microelectronic scanners."

page 49: written in margin: CryptoLogics (underscored)

page 50: underlined: "As Eliot also observed, however, between the idea and the act falls the shadow."
-- underlined (quotation from Machiavelli hanging over Sprague's desk): "It must be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new system. For the initiator has the enmity of all who would profit by the preservation of the old institutions and merely lukewarm defenders in those who would gain by the new ones."

page 51: underlined: "It is the kind of innovation that Joseph Schumpeter had in mind when he coined the term /creative destruction/."
-- marginal line beside description of Prodigy network; written in margin: "Prodigy -- shopping by computer"

page 53: underlined: "Intelligent scanner technology not only threatens mainframe gateways and data traps but also highlights the vulnerability of some phone companies' grand plans to become the chief channel for new computer-data and business-information services. By using the rich resources of specialized computing power both in the network and on the customer's desk, Cryptologics manages, for some purposes, to simulate and even improve upon the digitally switched networks of the phone company. Transmitting the contents of a CD-ROM through the fastest current fax machine, for example, would take a phone company six full days."

Chapter 4: Let There Be Light

page 57: written in margin: "Shannon - father of digitals" (underscored)
-- underlined: "MIT professor Claude Shannon, a communications theorist who had spent most of his career at Bell Labs, had provided the conceptual foundations for all digital networks. His system showed how to transmit voice and video signals and computer data in digital form, store the information when needed, and switch it through the network's interconnections. This high-capacity, or 'broadband,' system, now called an integrated services digital network (ISDN), is perfectly suited for fiber optics."

page 58: written in margin: "PHONE SYSTEM" (underscored)

page 63: written in margin: "Fiber-Optic Tech problems" (next to description of Corning Glass's problems with interference in the fibers)

page 69: underlined: "The focus of competition has shifted from long-distance lines to integrated services digital networks (ISDN) reaching into every home and office. The creation of this network, together with the computer systems that are linked to it and the optoelectronics that make it work, is the key to U.S. competitiveness. Nearly every industrial policy in other developed countries is preparing to face this challenge. The Japanese government has projected total investments of nearly $300 billion to bring this ISDN network to fruition. The U.S. government is doggedly blocking any such achievement in America."
-- underlined: "Moreover, the U.S. Congress has created cable-television monopolies in every city."

page 71: underlined: "In addition, the huge bandwidth of fiber optics means that phone companies would have no incentive to restrict access to the network."; written in margin: "Fiber Optics -- Huge Bandwidth" (underscored)
-- marginal line beside: "Even more significant is the emergence of effective cellular-phone systems that do not use wire at all. While television service is moving increasingly from the air to wire, telephone service is shifting increasingly from the wire to the air. Far from being a monopoly threat, fiber to the home is now indispen-"
-- underlined: "Under FCC rules, each regional cellular market is shared between the local phone companies and other bidders, but the only coherent national cellular system, Cellular One, is dominated by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc."

Chapter 5: The Telefuture

page 75: written in margin: "Replace top-down pyramid w/ network of creative, individual users, 'smart terminals.'"
-- underlined: "I first declared the coming death of television and the birth of the telecomputer in two articles published in early 1989 and then in my book /Microcosm./ The death of television, I wrote, would be the salvation of American competitiveness."
-- underlined: "Richard Elkus"
-- underlined: "Prometrix Corporation"
-- underlined: "Jerry Pearlman, CEO of Zenith"

page 77: underlined: "The U.S. computer industry will have to understand that the biggest threat to its dominance will come from cheap video super-computers sold for use in the home by Japanese TV manufacturers."

page 78: underlined: "The air is a hopeless bottleneck, however, for the huge bandwidth needed to transmit images."
-- underlined: "The spread of mobile-phone technologies will create powerful new competition for the spectrum space now hogged by television. The plummeting price of computer video will create an ever-growing demand for alternative distribution modes for video programming. The limitations of the spectrum, combined with new technology, will dictate a reversal in the proportionate use of wire and air for audio and video. This is the essence of the 'telefuture.' Voice communication, now conducted through wires, will be carried over the air. Entertainment data, now broadcast over the air, will be transmitted through fiber-optic wires."
-- underlined (all in BLUE from this point forward, unless noted): "The cable industry, beset on one side by the power of fiber and on the other by the growing efficiency of direct-broadcast satellite"
-- underlined: "The Japanese have clear goals for their own telefuture. Although their fiber network is now far smaller than America's, the Japanese plan to spend some $120 billion to take fiber to the home by the year 2000. They also plan to spend another $150 billion to create entire 'information cities.' These cities will be completely wired with digital fiber networks connecting and transforming schools, libraries, hospitals, offices, and all the now-separate analog industries. A large Japanese lead in laying fiber to the home would allow them to wrest leadership from Corning and AT&T, whose fiber production"; written in margin: "Japanese plans for fiber-optic future"

page 81: circled word: "optoelectronics"
-- underlined: "optoelectronics is the technology for joining the light pulses of the fiber network to the electronic pulses of computers"

page 83: underlined: "Any accelerated program for fiber to the home, though, would have to include entertainment video to make it pay."
-- underlined: "the electric utilities that string glass wires within their electric cables"
-- underlined: "While the TV-set industry consists mostly of a few gigantic Asian and European conglomerates, the computer business in the U.S. is composed of some 20,000 firms, including 14,000 software companies. Nearly 800 digital image-processing companies are devoted directly to the technologies of telecomputing, along with nearly 1,000 firms in the field of multimedia programming."; written in margin: "See Sheet on Interactive TV from Utni [sic] Review" (underscore in Z formation)

page 84: underlined: "The telecomputer is on its way. One of the most ambitious telecomputer concepts, launched by veterans of Next and Apple, goes by the name of Frox. This machine will connect with CD-ROMs, edit out television advertisements, program the VCR, search databases for selected news items, and -- significantly -- answer the telephone."; written in the margin, large: "FROX -- 1ST TELECOMPUTER" (underscored)
-- underlined: "In 1989, Sony spent $3.4 billion for Columbia Pictures, or 350 times the studio's annual earnings, and then paid $700 million for the rights to the services of Hollywood executives Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the producers of /Batman/. The Japanese are learning that although the microchip makes high-quality digital video possible, software makes it usable -- and valuable."
-- underlined: "By extending the life of television into the next century with HDTV, the Japanese hope to thwart the age of the telecomputer until they can rule it."

page 85: underlined: "All the fiefdoms of the television age must give way to the new imperative of the computer age: the creation of a national integrated services digital network of fiber optics."
-- underlined: "sound industrial policy -- one that focuses not on regulations that promote U.S. television production but on the removal of government obstacles to the rapid deployment of fiber optics."
-- double marginal line around: "The FCC must relax its 1970 restrictions on cross-ownership of cable and telephone lines so that the phone companies can transmit video entertainment throughout their own regions. Judge Greene must relax the restrictions in his Modified Final Judgment so that the phone companies can enter information-based businesses, including transmission of TV programs. Congress must revise the 1984 Cable Communications Policy Act to end the entertainment-video cable monopolies."

page 86: underlined: "Just as intelligence and control are moving from gigantic mainframes to personal computers, from centralized databases to desktop libraries, form the central Bell pyramid to a new array of communications tools, and from a few national broadcast networks to millions of programmers around the globe, so is economic power shifting from mass institutions to individuals."

page 12: written in margin: "Flattery" (underscored); underlined: "This is a form of flattery so pervasive, so fundamental to the very nature of representation, that it has escaped notice, though it ultimately accounts for the much remarked narcissism of our age. The flattered self is a mediated self, and the alchemy of mediation, the osmotic process through which reality and representation fuse, gets /carried/ into our psyches by the irresistible flatter that goes with being incessantly addressed."
