1.  The Future Is Kid Stuff

the rhetoric of political appeals using children "was intended to avow that this issue, like an ideological Möbius strip, only *permitted* one side" (Edelman 2)

"the fantasy subtending the image of the Child invariably shapes the logic within which the political itself must be thought" (Edelman 2)

"the terms of what this book describes as reproductive futurism: terms that impose an ideological limit on political discourse as such, preserving in the process the absolute privilege of heteronormativity by rendering unthinkable, by casting outside the political domain, the possibility of a queer resistance to this organizing principle of communal relations" (Edelman 2)

"That Child remains the perpetual horizon of every acknowledged politics, the fantasmatic beneficiary of every political intervention" (Edelman 3)

"What, in that case, would it signify *not* to be 'fighting for the children'?  How could one take the *other* 'side,' when taking any side at all necessarily constrains one to take the side *of*, by virtue of taking a side *within*, a political order that returns to the Childe as the image of the future it intends?" (Edelman 3)

"*queerness* names the side of those *not* 'fighting for the children,; the side outside the consensus by which all politics confirms the absolute value of reproductive futurism" (Edelman 3)

"*queerness*, by contrast, figures, outside and beyond its political  symptoms, the place of the social order's death drive... queerness attains its ethical value precisely insofar as it accedes to that place, accepting its figural status as resistance to the viability of the social while insisting on the inextricability of such resistance from every social structure" (Edelman 3)

"I examine in this book the pervasive invocation of the Child as the emblem of futurity's unquestioned value and propose against it the impossible project of a queer oppositionality that would oppose itself to the structural determinants of politics as such, which is also to say, that would oppose itself to the logic of opposition." (Edelman 3-4)

"Far from partaking of this narrative movement toward a viable political future, far from perpetuating the fantasy of meaning's eventual resolution, the queer comes to figure the bar to every realization of futurity, the resistance, internal to the social, to every social structure or form." (Edelman 4)

"to refuse the insistence of hope itself as affirmation, which is always affirmation of an order whose refusal will register as unthinkable, irresponsible, inhumane" (Edelman 4)

"When I argue, then, that we might do well to attempt what is surely impossible -- to withdraw our allegiance, however compulsory, from a reality based on the Ponzi scheme of reproductive futurism -- I do not intend to propose some 'good' that will thereby be assured.  To the contrary, I mean to insist that nothing, and certainly not what we call the 'good,' can every have any assurance at all in the order of the Symbolic." (Edelman 4)

"we might rather, figuratively, cast our vote for 'none of the above,' for the primacy of a constant *no* in response to the law of the Symbolic.... The structuring optimism of politics to which the order of meaning commits us, installing as it does the perpetual hope of reaching meaning through signification, is always, I would argue, a negation of this primal, constitutive, and negative act." (Edelman 5)

"the queerness of which I speak would deliberately sever us from ourselves, from the assurance, that is, of *knowing* ourselves and hence of *knowing* our 'good.'  Such queerness proposes, in place of the good, something I want to call 'better,' though it promises, in more than one sense of the phrase, absolutely nothing.  I connect this something better with Lacan's characterization of what he calls 'truth,' where truth does not assure happiness, or even, as Lacan makes clear, the good." (Edelman 5)

"Truth, like queerness, irreducibly linked to the 'aberrant or atypical,' to what chafes against 'normalization,' finds its value not in a good susceptible to generalization, but only in the stubborn particularity that voids every notion of a general good." (Edelman 6)

"Divesting such politics of its thematic trappings, bracketing the particularity of its various proposals for social organization, the queer insists that politics is always a politics of the signifier, or even of what Lacan will often refer to as 'the letter.' It serves to shore up a reality always unmoored by significant and lacking any guarantee." (Edelman 6)

"queerness exposes the obliquity of our relation to what we experience in and as social reality, alerting us to the fantasies structurally necessary in order to sustain it and engaging those fantasies through the figural logics, the linguistic structures, that shape them." (Edelman 6-7)

"queer theory must always insist on its connection to the vicissitudes of the sign, to the tension between the signifier's collapse into the letter's cadaverous materiality and its participation in a system of reference wherein it generates meaning itself.  As a particular story, in other words, of why storytelling fails, one that takes both the value and the burden of that failure upon itself, queer theory, as I construe it, marks the 'other' side of politics: the 'side' where narrative realization and derealization overlap, where the energies of vitalization ceaselessly turn against themselves; the 'side' outside all political sides, committed as they are, on every side, to futurism's unquestioned good" (Edelman 7)

"politics may function as the framework within which we experience social reality, but only insofar as it compels us to experience that reality in the form of a fantasy: the fantasy, precisely, of form as such, of an order, an organization, that assures the stability of our identities as subjects and the coherence of the Imaginary totalizations through which those identities appear to us in recognizable form" (Edelman 7)

"the signifier, which calls us into meaning by seeming to call us to ourselves: this signifier only bestows a sort of *promissory* identity, one with which we can never succeed in fully coinciding because we, as subjects of the signifier, can only be signifiers ourselves, can only ever aspire to catch up to whatever it is we might signify by closing the gap that divides us and, paradoxically, makes us subjects *through that act of division alone*" (Edelman 8)

"Politics, that is, names the struggle to effect a fantasmatic order of reality in which the subject's alienation would vanish into the seamlessness of identity at the endpoint of the endless chain of signifiers lived as history." (Edelman 8)

"This means not only that politics conforms to the temporality of desire, to what we might call the inevitable historicity of desire... but also that politics is a name for the temporalization of desire, for its translation into a narrative, for its teleological determination.  Politics, that is, by externalizing and configuring in the fictive form of a narrative, allegorizes or elaborates sequentially, precisely *as* desire, those overdeterminations of libidinal positions and inconsistencies of psychic defenses occasioned by what disarticulates the narrativity of desire:  the drives, themselves intractable, unassimilable to the logic of interpretation or the demands of meaning-production; the drives that carry the destabilizing force of what insists outside or beyond, because foreclosed by, signification." (Edelman 9)

"the death drive names what the queer, in the order of the social, is called forth to figure: the negativity opposed to every form of social viability." (Edelman 9)

"the death drive marks the excess embedded within the Symbolic through the loss, the Real loss, that the advent of the signifier effects" (Edelman 9)

the distinction "between the subject of desire and the subject of the drive" exists in part in that desire is born of lack, while the drive is born of surplus (Edelman 10)

"Politics, then, in opposing itself to the negativity of such a drive, gives us history as the continuous staging of our dream of eventual self-realization by endlessly reconstructing, in the mirror of desire, what we take to be reality itself." (Edelman 10)

"the Child has come to embody for us the telos of the social order and come to be seen as the one for whom that order is held in perpetual trust.
     In its coercive universalization, however, the image of the Child, not to be confused with the lived experiences of any historical children, serves to regulate political discourse -- to prescribe what will count as political discourse -- by compelling such discourse to accede in advance to the reality of a collective future whose figurative status we are never permitted to acknowledge or address." (Edelman 11)
 
"we are no more able to conceive of a politics without a fantasy of the future than we are able to conceive of a future without the figure of the Child" (Edelman 11)

"whatever refuses this mandate by which our political institutions compel the collective reproduction of the Child must appear as a threat not only to the organization of a given social order but also, and far more ominously, to social order as such" (Edelman 11)

"the function of the child as a prop of the secular theology on which our social reality rests" (Edelman 12)

"If, however, there is *no baby* and, in consequence, *no future*, then the blame must fall on the fatal lure of sterile, narcissistic enjoyments understood as inherently destructive of meaning and therefore as responsible for the undoing of social organization, collective reality, and, inevitably, life itself." (Edelman 13)

"the author of _The Children of Men_... succumbs so completely to the narcissism -- all pervasive, self-congratulatory, and strategically misrecognized -- that animates pronatalism" (Edelman 13)

"so long as the specifically heterosexual alibi of reproductive necessity obscures the drive *beyond* meaning driving the machinery of sexual meaningfulness" (Edelman 13)

"the only queerness that queer sexualities could ever hope to signify would spring from their determined opposition to this underlying structure of the political" (Edelman 13)

"Conservatives acknowledge this radical potential, which is also to say, this radical *threat*, of queerness more fully than liberals, for conservatism preemptively imagines the wholesale rupturing of the social fabric, whereas liberalism conservatively clings to a faith in its limitless elasticity." (Edelman 14)

"the governing compulsion, the singular imperative, that affords us no meaningful choice is the compulsion to embrace our own futurity in the privileged form of the Child, to imagine each moment as pregnant with the Child of our Imaginary identifications" (Edelman 15)

"the true oppositional politics implicit in the practice of queer sexualities lies not in the liberal discourse an patient negotiation of tolerances and rights, important as those undoubtedly are to all of us still denied them, but in the capacity of queer sexualities to figure the radical dissolution of the contract, in every sense social and Symbolic, on which the future as putative assurance against the jouissance of the Real depends." (Edelman 16)

"dare we pause for a moment to acknowledge that Mr. Wildmon might be right -- or, more important, that he *ought to be* right: that queerness *should* and *must* redefine such notions as 'civil order' through a rupturing of our foundational faith in the reproduction of futurity?" (Edelman 16-17)

"queers -- by which I mean all so stigmatized for failing to comply with heteronormative mandates" (Edelman 17)

"To *figure* the undoing of civil society, the death drive of the dominant order, is neither to be nor to become that drive; such being is not to the point.  Rather, acceding to that figural position means recognizing and refusing the consequences of grounding reality in denial of the drive.  As the death drive dissolves those congealments of identity that permit us to know and survive as ourselves, so the queer must insist on disturbing, on queering, social organization as such -- on disturbing, therefore, and on queering *ourselves* and our investment in such organization.  For queerness can never define an identity; it can only ever disturb one." (Edelman 17)

"the efficacy of queerness, its real strategic value, lies in its resistance to a Symbolic reality that only ever invests us as subjects insofar as we invest ourselves in it, clinging to its governing fictions, its persistent sublimations, as reality itself" (Edelman 18)

"The Child, that is, marks the fetishistic fixation of heteronormativity: an erotically charged investment in the rigid sameness of identity that is central to the compulsory narrative of reproductive futurism." (Edelman 21)

"One way to approach the death drive in terms of the economy of this 'chain of natural events' thus shaped by linguistic structures -- structures that allow us to produce those 'events' through the logic of narrative history -- is by reading the play and the place of the death drive in relation to a theory of irony, that queerest of rhetorical devices, especially as discussed by Paul de Man.  Proposing that 'any theory of irony is the undoing, the necessary undoing, of any theory of narrative,' de Man adduces the constant tension between irony as a particular trope and narrative as a representational mode that allegorizes tropes in general." (Edelman 23)

"The corrosive force of irony thus carries a charge for de Man quite similar to that of the death drive as understood by Lacan.  'Words have a way of saying things which are not at all what you want them to say,' de Man notes. 'There is a machine here, a text machine, an implacable determination and total arbitrariness... which inhabits words on the level of the play of the signifier, which undoes any narrative consistence of lines, and which undoes the reflexive and dialectical model, both of which are, as you know, the basis of any narration." (Edelman 23)

the "constant disruption of narrative signification" as "a version of the death drive": "If irony can serve as one of the names for the force of that unthought remainder, might not queerness serve as another?" (Edelman 24)

"Queerness, therefore, is never a matter of being or becoming but, rather, of *embodying* the remainder of the Real internal to the Symbolic order.  One name for this unnameable remainder, as Lacan describes it, is jouissance, sometimes translated as 'enjoyment': a movement beyond the pleasure principle, beyond the distinctions of pleasure and pain, a violent passage beyond the bounds of identity, meaning, and law." (Edelman 25)

"every refusal of the figural status to which queers are distinctively called reproduces the triumph of narrative as the *allegorization* of irony, as the logic of a temporality that always serves to 'straighten' it out, and thus proclaims the universality of reproductive futurism" (Edelman 26)

"by assuming the 'truth' of our queer capacity to figure the undoing of the Symbolic, and of the Symbolic subject as well, we might undertake the impossible project of imagining an oppositional political stance exempt from the imperative to reproduce the politics of signification (the politics aimed at closing the gap opened up by the signifier itself) which can only return us, by way of the Child, to the politics of reproduction." (Edelman 27)

"the left would eliminate queerness by shining the cool light of reason upon it, hoping thereby to expose it as merely a mode of sexual expression free of the all-pervasive coloring, the determining fantasy formation, by means of which it can seem to portend, and not for the right alone, the undoing of the social order and its cynosure, the Child." (Edelman 28)

"The sacralization of the Child thus necessitates the sacrifice of the queer." (Edelman 28)

"With this fatal embrace of a futurism so blindly committed to the figure of the Child that it will justify refusing health care benefits to the adults that some children become, [Cardinal] Law lent his voice to the mortifying mantra of a communal jouissance that depends on the fetishization of the Child at the expense of whatever such fetishization must inescapably queer." (Edelman 29)

"Queers must respond to the violent force of such constant provocations not only by insisting on our equal right to the social order's prerogatives, not only by avowing our capacity to promote that order's coherence and integrity, but also by saying explicitly what Law and the Pope and the whole of the Symbolic order for which they stand hear anyway in each and every expression or manifestation of queer sexuality:  Fuck the social order and the Child in whose name we're collectively terrorized; fuck Annie; fuck the waif from *Les Mis*; fuck the poor, innocent kid on the Net, fuck Laws both with capital *l*s and with small; fuck the whole network of Symbolic relations and the future that serves as its prop." (Edelman 29)

"the only oppositional status to which our queerness could ever lead would depend on our taking seriously the place of the death drive we're called on to figure and insisting, against the cult of the Child and the political order it enforces, that we, as Guy Hocquenghem made clear, are 'not the signifier of what might become a new form of "social organization,"' that we do not intend a new politics, a better society, a brighter tomorrow, since all of these fantasies reproduce the past, through displacement, in the form of the future.  We choose, instead, *not* to choose the Child, as disciplinary image of the Imaginary past or as site of a projective identification with an always impossible future." (Edelman 30-31)

"It is we who must bury the subject in the tomb-like hollow of the signifier, pronouncing at last the words for which we're condemned should we speak them or not: that *we* are the advocates of abortion; that the Child as futurity's emblem must die; that the future is mere repetition and just as lethal as the past." (Edelman 31)


2.  Sinthomosexuality

The neologism *sinthom*osexuality "would assert itself instead *against* futurity, *against* its propagation, insofar as it would designate an impasse in the passage to the future and, by doing so, would pass beyond, pass *through*, the saving fantasy futurity denotes. Can that be right, though?  How could 'saving' name a future that, whatever else it holds in store, is bound to hold our deaths?... In short: through fantasy.  The central prop and underlying agency of futurism, fantasy alone endows reality with fictional coherence and stability, which seem to guarantee that such reality, the social world in which we take our place, will still survive when we do not." (Edelman 33-34)

"fantasy names the only place where desiring subjects can live" (Edelman 34)

"*Sinthom*osexuality, on the other hand -- denying the appeal of fantasy, refusing the promise of futurity that mends each tear, however mean, in reality's dress with threads of meaning (attached as they are to the eye-catching lure we might see as the sequins of sequence, which dazzle our vision by producing the constant illusion of *con*sequence) -- offers us fantasy turned inside out, the seams of its costume exposing reality's seamlessness as mere seeming, the fraying knots that hold each sequin in place now usurping that place.  The *sinthome* -- a term, as Lacan explains in Seminar 23, that he takes from an 'old way of writing what was written later as "symptom"' -- speaks to the singularity of the subject's existence, to the particular way each subject manages to knot together the orders of the Symbolic, the Imaginary, and the Real." (Edelman, 35)

"the sinthome, in its refusal of meaning, procures the determining relation to enjoyment by which the subject finds itself driven beyond the logic of fantasy or desire.  It operates, for Lacan, as the knot that holds the subject together, that ties or binds the subject to its consitutive libidinal career, and assures that no subject, try as it may, can ever 'get over' itself -- 'get over,' that is, the fixation of the drive that determines its jouissance." (Edelman 35-36)

the sinthome as "a 'pure sign,' a site of singularity and hence of nonexchangeability that fixes us as definitively, and as meaninglessly, as a fingerprint" (Edelman 36)

"For the sinthome 'is literally our only substance,' as Zizek rightly asserts, 'the only positive support of our being, the only point that gives consistency to the subject.'  As the subject's 'only substance,' though, the sinthome, like a catachresis, brings the subject into being at the cost of a necessary blindness to this determination by the sinthome -- a blindness to the arbitrary fixation of enjoyment responsible for its consistency.  Disavowing the meaningless fiat of such a catachrestic sinthome, the subject misreads its identity as a metaphor instead" (Edelman 36-37)

"this ellipsis [in Lacan's designation of the signifier as S1..., indicating the belief in a final signifier, S2] itself should be understood as the defining mark of futurism, inscribing the faith that temporal duration will result in the realization of meaning by way of a 'final signifier' that will make meaning whole at last.  *Sinthom*osexuality, by contrast, scorns such belief in a final signifier, reducing *every* signifier to the status of the letter and insisting on access to jouissance in place of access to sense, on identification with one's sinthome instead of belief in its meaning" (Edelman 37)

"I am calling *sinthom*osexuality, then the site where the fantasy of futurism confronts the insistence of a jouissance that rends it precisely by *rendering* it in relation to that drive" (Edelman 38)

"Thus, homosexuality is thought as a threat to the logic of thought itself insofar as it figures the availability of an unthinkable jouissance that would put an end to fantasy -- and, with it, to futurity -- by reducing the assurance of meaning in fantasy's promise of continuity to the meaningless circulation and repetitions of the drive." (Edelman 39)

"the end of jouissance does not coincide with what it leads to, namely, the fact that we reproduce" (Edelman 39, quoting Lacan)

"the all-pervasive fantasy within which our meaning is always a function not only of what we *do* with our genitals but also of what we *don't* do: a function, that is, of the envy-, contempt-, and anxiety-inducing fixation on our freedom from the necessity of translating the corrupt, unregenerate vulgate of fucking into the infinitely tonier, indeed sacramental, Latin of procreation" (Edelman 40)

reading of *A Christmas Carol*:  "In proposing that Scrooge be viewed, instead, as a canonical literary instantiation of *sinthom*osexuality, I make no pretense of revealing an 'identity' encoded in the text.  Rather, I want to attend to the potent effects of the cultural fantasy linking Scrooge to the fate of Tiny Tim as surely as the sinthome is linked to the historical consistency of the subject, or as queer sexualities are linked to the conceptual coherence of heterosexual desire" (Edelman 43)

"Scrooge, as *sinthom*osexual, denies, by virtue of his unwillingness to contribute to the communal realization of futurity, the fantasy structure, the aesthetic frame, supporting reality itself" (Edelman 44-45)

"Christmas here stands in the place of the obligatory collective reproduction of the Child, the obligatory investment in the social precisely as the *order* of the Child, which demands our collective assent to the truth that the Child exists to make flesh" (Edelman 45)

"the structural mandate that he who refuses the Child *be* refused, providing the occasion for communal access to the negativity of a jouissance for which, as its embodiment, the *sinthom*osexual must, in the first place, be projectively reviled" (Edelman 45)

"the fantasy, perhaps the most pleasurable of them all, that the pleasure we derive from Scrooge's 'salvation' through punitive abjection shares nothing with the sadomasochistic enjoyment Scrooge figures within the text" (Edelman 46)

"Scrooge's persistence, therefore, *as* Scrooge, as the child-refusing *sinthom*osexual whom the spirit of Christmas Yet to Come exposes as a life-denying black hole, must be understood as determining that there can be no future at all" (Edelman 46)

"Only by thus renouncing ourselves can queers escape the charge of embracing and promoting a 'culture of death,' earning the right to be viewed as 'something far greater than what we do with our genitals.'" (Edelman 47)

referring to Lacan: "faced with this sinthome, itself the limit of every analysis and beyond interpretation, the subject, he proposed must come at last to identify with *it*.  The subject, that is, must accept its sinthome, its particular pathway to jouissance....  This, I suggest, is the ethical burden to which queerness must accede in a social order intent on misrecognizing its investment in morbidity, fetishization, and repetition: to inhabit the place of meaninglessness associated with the sinthome; to figure an unregenerate, and unregenerating, sexuality whose singular insistence on jouissance, rejecting every constraint imposed by sentimental futurism, exposes aesthetic culture -- the culture of forms and their reproduction, the culture of Imaginary lures -- as always already a 'culture of death' intent on abjecting the force of a death drive that shatters the tomb we call life" (Edelman 47-48)

"in the death drive, the concept 'dead' functions in exactly the same way as '*heimlich*' in the Freudian *unheimlich*, as coinciding with its negation: the 'death drive' designates the dimension of what horror fiction calls the 'undead,' a strange, immortal, indestructible life that persists beyond death" (Edelman 48, quoting Zizek)

"The death drive's 'immortality,' then, refers to a persistent negation that offers assurance of nothing at all: neither identity, nor survival, nor any promise of a future.  Instead, it insists both on and as the impossibility of Symbolic closure, the absence of any Other to affirm the Symbolic order's truth, and hence the illusory status of meaning as defense against the self-negating substance of jouissance" (Edelman 48)

"the *sinthom*osexual's narcissism is a narcissism unto death, exposing a duality or division internal to narcissism itself.  Just as the projection of the sinthome onto those condemned as *sinthom*osexuals enacts the *sinthomatic* drive of reproductive futurism, so the *sinthom*osexual's association with narcissistic satisfaction, in light of the self-satisfaction afforded by futurism's repudiation of narcissism, betrays and awareness that something internal to narcissism itself resists its libidinal investment in the ego as a form.  Narcissism, then, like jouissance, names two contradictory states, one of which shelters the ego from the other's self-destructive effects." (Edelman 50)

Joan Copjec's invocation of the Lacanian response to the pervasive misunderstanding of narcissism as such:  "Since something always appears to be missing from any representation, narcissism *cannot* consist in finding satisfaction in one's own visual image.  It must, rather, consist in the belief that one's own being exceeds the imperfections of its image.  Narcissism, then, seeks the self beyond the self-image, with which the subject constantly finds fault and in which it constantly fails to recognize itself..." (Edelman 51, quoting Copjec)

"*narcissism is always a narcissism of the Other.*  By this I mean not only that the Other, conceptualized as the obstacle to our own coherence, seems always to occasion the narcissistic aggression around which the subject takes shape, but also that narcissism bespeaks the ascription of the ego of recognizable and defensible form only insofar as narcissism is invested from the outset, which is to say, primally, in the nondifferentiation of ego and id, in the unsymbolizable Real of the drive that imperils the ego as object" (Edelman 51)

Bersani:  "sexuality -- at least in the mode in which it is constituted -- could be thought of as a tautology for masochism" (Edelman 51, quoting Bersani)

Freud says that "masochism is older than sadism, and that sadism is the destructive instinct turned outward"; also: "It really seems as though it is necessary for us to destroy some other thing or person in order not to destroy ourselves, in order to guard against the impulsion to self-destruction" (Edelman 52, quoting Freud)

"narcissism's first paradox:  it loves Otherness too well, beyond all reason, beyond all pleasure, even unto death.  And from this there follows a second paradox:  narcissism, construed as libidinal investment in the formalized ego it cathects, by means of which the self attempts to assure its own preservation, comes nonetheless to designate a life-denying economy, a Scrooge-like self-containment, marked by a fatal rejection of the energies on which social survival depends.  Might this, then, be the place to recall that Freud's earliest invocation of narcissistic investment occurs in the context of theorizing the origins of gay male sexuality?" (Edelman 52)

of *Silas Marner*:  "What, after all, are the chances -- how astronomical must be the odds -- that a near-sighted, nearly friendless man, still mourning the theft of his long-hoarded gold, would suffer a cataleptic fit in his doorway one frigid New Year's Eve at the very moment that a gold-haired child, attracted by the light from his wide-open door, should toddle away from the corpse of her mother, frozen in the snow onto which she'd collapsed in an opiated haze, and sat herself silenty before the hearth, where the near-sighted man, his seizure now past, could mistake her bright hair for his gold?" (Edelman 56-57)

"But here is the nub of the matter.  *Silas Marner*, while endorsing the 'orderly sequence by which the seed brings forth a crop after its kind,' and with it the narrative necessity inseparable from reproductive futurism, introduces its privileged emblem, the promise condensed in the image of the Child, as a figure of *naturalization*: as a figure, to be sure, of nature, but one that reads nature itself as a figure that language must posit in order to designate something that's absent from nature as such.... And what's missing from nature, what the figure of naturalization attempts to secure, is the system of values, the more economy, that Marner, like all social subjects, is made to value *as nature itself* -- the system of values the novel, however fantastic or queer the machinery by which it 'brings forth' that implausible end, must characterize as 'orderly,' as part of the natural order, and not, therefore, as requiring to be posited at all." (Edelman 57-58)

"Freud, as the century just ended began, already advised us that parental love demands to be viewed as 'nothing but the parents' narcissism born again.'  But the ostensible self-evidence, throughout our culture, of the difference between narcissism, on the one hand, and the selflessness we associate with the care and nurturing of children, on the other, between the figures of *sinthom*osexuality and the sinthomatic drive to produce and abject them, makes clear, as the twenty-first century starts, that what's finally at issue in the production of the Child and the future it serves to figure, for Silas Marner, for Scrooge, and for all who must live under futurism's gun, is the *style* by which a culture enacts its sinthome while disavowing it." (Edelman 59)

"Futurism thus generates generational succession, temporality, and narrative sequence, not toward the end of enabling change, but, instead, of perpetuating sameness, of turning back time to assure repetition -- or to assure a logic of resemblance (more precisely: a logic of metaphoricity) in the service of representation and, by extension, of desire." (Edelman 60)

"From this springs a final paradox:  homosexuality, though charged with, and convicted of, a future-negating sameness construed as reflecting its pathological inability to deal with the fact of difference, gets put in the position of difference from the heteronormativity that, despite its persistent propaganda for its own propagation through *sexual* difference, refuses homosexuality's difference from the value of difference it claims as its own." (Edelman 60)

on Baudrillard's suggestion that removing the procreative aspect from sex via artificial insemination makes sex "extraneous, a useless function":  "What can the lament for the putative loss of the sexual function mean, therefore, if not its very opposite: that heterosexuality, stripped of its ancient reproductive alibi, must assume at last the despiritualized burden of its status as *sexual function*, as *sinthom*osexuality; that in the face of what Baudrillard calls 'automatic' or 'biotechnological' modes of reproduction, it must recognize the 'extraneous' element *in* sex that is never extraneous *to* sex and that marks it as a 'useless function,' as a meaningless and unrecuperable expense, or even, as Jacques Derrida has written with regard to *différance*, 'as expenditure without reserve, as the irreparable loss of presence, the irreversible usage of energy, that is, as the death instinct.'" (Edelman 64)


3.  Compassion's Compulsion

"What makes compassion so touchy is, rather the *absence* of such a lobby, the fact that every hardening of the heart against compassion's knock presents itself as hard-headed reason intent on denying *false* compassion to keep the way clear for the true." (Edelman 67)

"*sinthom*osexuals fall because they fail to fall in love, where love names the totalizing fantasy, always a fantasy of totalization, by which the subject defends against the disintegrative pulsion of the drive" (Edelman 73)

"Love, therefore, like fantasy, seeks to regain that lost immortality, and to do so, fantasmatically, by translating sexed reproduction, through which immortality was lost, into the very mode and guarantee of its future restoration.... *Sinthom*osexuality, by contrast, affirms a constant, eruptive jouissance that responds to the inarticulate real, to the impossibility of sexual rapport or of ever being able to signify the relation between the sexes.... *Sinthom*osexuality, then, like the death drive, engages, by refusing, the normative stasis, the immobility of sexuation to which we are delivered by Symbolic law and the promise of sexual relation." (Edelman 73-74)

*sinthom*osexuals "endanger the fantasy of survival by endangering the survival of love's fantasy, insisting instead on the machine-like working of the partial, dehumanizing drives..." (Edelman 74)

of Dan Savage's comment that gay parents "are not only making a commitment to our political future, but to the future, period":  "The messenger here may be a gay man, but the message is that of compulsory reproduction as inscribed on the anti-abortion billboard I mentioned in chapter 1:  choose life, for life and the baby and meaning hang together in the balance, confronting the lethal counterweight of narcissism, AIDS, and death, all of which spring from commitment to the meaningless eruptions of jouissance associated with the 'circuit parties' that gesture toward the circuit of the drive.  This fascism of the baby's face, which encourages parents, whether gay or straight, to join in a rousing chorus of 'Tomorrow Belongs to Me' suggests that if few can bring up a child without constantly bringing it up -- as if the future secured by the Child, the one true access to social security, could only be claimed for the other's sake, and never for one's own -- then that future can only belong to those who purport to *feel* for the other (with all the appropriate implication that such a "feeling *for*" suggests)." (Edelman 75)

of Hitchcock's dream of a cinema without film, in which the audience is directly manipulated through brain implants:  "Enacting a scenario worthy of Sade, this cinema without need of a movie would deny any agency to its viewers, reducing them merely to some, and not to *the* sum, of their parts.... This view of the end of cinema, understood in its double genitive sense, reads the spectator's sense of compassion, of emotional investment in the image on screen, with so little compassion of its own, that it fully acknowledges film as a form of Imaginary entrapment in which the filmmaker mobilizes identification with a totalizing image as surely 'implanted in [viewers'] brains' as electrodes themselves would be.  Hitchcock's fantasy, in other words, speaks less to his futuristic anticipation of what cinema might become than to his actual understanding of what narrative cinema always already is." (Edelman 81)

"a jouissance that responds to something mechanical -- beyond volition, automatic -- at the very heart of the experience that compels us to compassion: the jouissance of passing beyond the limit of the human and dissolving into the drive that insists beyond the subject's desire" (Edelman 81)

"For the *sinthom*osexual, who figures the unrestricted availability of jouissance, the continuous satisfaction that the drive attains by its pulsions and not by its end, threatens the subject inhabiting the temporality of desire, the subject who clings to the *non*satisfaction that *perpetuates* desire and finds its defense against jouissance in the narrative dilation that endlessly begets the future by always deferring it" (Edelman 86)

"desire is desire for no object but only, instead, for its own prolongation, for the future itself as libidinal project procured by its own constant lack" (Edelman 86)

"*Sinthom*osexuality, by contrast, brings into visibility the force of enjoyment that desire desires to put off." (Edelman 86)

on Paul de Man, on irony:  "irony, with its undoing of identity and refusal of historical progression, with its shattering of every totalized form (and of every form as totalization)" (Edelman 87)

"while desire as enabled by fantasy, though aiming to fill that emptiness by according it a substance and a form, only substitutes *absence* for presence, endless pursuit for satisfaction, the deferral that conjures futurity for the stuff of jouissance" (Edelman 89)

"compassion is *always* conservative, always intent on preserving the image in which the ego sees itself" (Edelman 89)

"if 'no one has any conceivable right' to engage in 'homosexual acts,' it is only insofar as 'homosexual acts' lead no one to conceive" (Edelman 90)

"Desire, that is, in opposition to the *sinthom*osexual who figures the drive, necessitates the emergence of fantasy precisely to screen out the drive's insistence" (Edelman 91)

quoting de Man, "The Rhetoric of Temporality":  "the tendency of... language toward narrative, the spreading out along the axis of an imaginary time in order to give duration to what is, in fact, simultaneous within the subject" (Edelman 91, quoting de Man 225)


4.  No Future

"a globally destructive, child-hating force is posited in these lines -- a force so strong as to *disallow* parents the occasion to cherish their children" (Edelman 112)

"To be sure, the stigmatized other in *general* can endanger our idea of the future, conjuring the intolerable image of its spoliation or pollution, the specter of its being appropriated for unendurable ends; but one *in particular* is stigmatized as threatening an end to the future itself.  That *one* remains always at hand to embody the force, which need never be specified, that prohibits America's parents, for example, from *being able* to cherish their children, since that *one*, as we know, intrudes on the collective reproduction of familialism by stealing, seducing, proselytizing, in short, by *adult*erating those children and putting in doubt the structuring fantasy that ensures 'our collective future.'" (Edelman 113)

"As the shadow of death that would put out the light of heterosexual reproduction, however, *sinthom*osexuality provides familial ideology, and the futurity whose cause it serves, with a paradoxical life support system by providing the occasion for both family and future to solicit our compassionate intervention insofar as they seem, like Tiny Tim, to be always on their last legs." (Edelman 114)

"a story resistant to Symbolic survival through reproductive futurism might still survive if its narrative thematics... could be discarded and its formal properties... could conduce to Imaginary form" (Edelman 117)

on Hitchcock's *The Birds*:  "the 'finish' fails not simply , as many maintain to this day, because the film is open-ended, (suggesting a dizzying array of possible futures beyond its frame), but, more significantly, because it declines to affirm as certain any future at all." (Edelman 118)

"Neither in theme nor in visual practice does *The Birds* sing Mother Nature's praise; nor do mothers and children receive from the film the extorted tribute that sentimentality would grant them as 'their due.'  *The Birds*, to the contrary, comes to roost, with a skittish and volatile energy, on a perch from which it seems to brood -- dispassionately, inhumanly -- on the gap opened up within nature by something inherently contra naturam: the death drive that haunts the Symbolic with its excess of jouissance and finds its figural expression in *sinthom*osexuality."  (Edelman 119)

"The narrative that raises meaninglessness as a possibility, after all, necessarily bestows a particular meaning on such meaninglessness itself.  By deploying, in other words, a given figure, such as, in this instance, the birds, as the signifier intended to materialize the general 'possibility that life is meaningless,' the text necessarily gestures toward a *specific* threat to meaning and suggests particular strategies by which one might manage to ward it off." (Edelman 120)

"the extent to which the birds take aim at the social structures of meaning that observances like the birthday party serve to secure and enact: take aim, that is, not only at children and the sacralization of childhood, but also at the very organization of meaning around structures of subjectivity that celebrate, along with the day of one's birth, the ideology of reproductive necessity." (Edelman 121)

"eros as the agency that generates meaning and the Child in a single blow, breeding thereby a happy heterosexual economy in which the Child means 'meaning' for adults, who can only attain it by virtue of participating in the labor of giving (it) birth" (Edelman 125-27)

"By resisting the appeal of such couplings, however, heterogenitality's either/or, we might manage to kill those two birds with one stone and suggest that the birds in Hitchcock's film, by virtue of fucking up -- and with -- the matrix of heterosexual mating, desublimate the reproductive rites of the movie's human lovebirds, about which, as about the products of which, they don't give a flying fuck." (Edelman 132)

on the moment in *The Birds* when Cathy asks if the lovebirds are "a man and a woman":  "Melanie, to whom she directs this question, deflects it with an uncomfortable laugh and a dismissive, 'Well, I suppose.'  But what if her supposition were wrong?  Or what if, more disturbing still, her answer were *literally* true: what if the structuring principle, the world-making logic of heterosexual meaningfulness were merely a *supposition*, merely a *positing*, as de Man would say, and not, therefore, imbued with the referential necessity of a 'meaning'?  After all, as de Man reminds us, 'language posits and language means... but language cannot posit meaning.'" (Edelman 139)

the birds "come, that is, to trace a connection, as directly as the crow flies, between 'disorder in the family' and the rupture, the radical loss of familiarity, unleashed by jouissance" (Edelman 149)

"Rather than expanding the reach of the human, as in Butler's claim for Antigone, we might, with Leonard and the birds, insist on enlarging the *inhuman* instead -- or enlarging what, in its excess, in its unintelligibility, exposes the human itself as always misrecognized catachresis, a positing blind to the willful violence that marks its imposition." (Edelman 152)

"We, the *sinthom*osexuals who figure the death drive of the social, must accept that we will be vilified as the agents of that threat.  But 'they,' the defenders of futurity, buzzed by negating our negativity, are themselves, however unknowingly, its secret agents too, reacting, in the name of humanity, in the name of life, to the threat of the death drive we figure with the violent rush of a jouissance, which only returns them, ironically, to the death drive in spit of themselves.  Futurism makes *sinthom*osexuals, not humans, of us all.
     We shouldn't dismiss as coincidence, then, that the catchphrase best expressing our current captivity to futurism's logic and serving as a bridge between left and right in the American political scene, is on that *sinthom*osexuals, like Hitchcock's birds, could endorse as well: 'Leave no child behind.'  In repeating it, though, *sinthom*osexuals bring out what's 'impossible, inhuman' within it: a haunting, destructive excess bound up with its pious sentimentality, an overdetermination that betrays the place of the kernel of irony that futurism tries to allegorize as narrative, as history.  The political regime of futurism, unable to escape what it abjects, negates it as the negation of meaning, of the Child, and of the future the Child portends." (Edelman 153-54)
