1. CRISIS

1.1 The Proliferation of Hybrids

"If reading the daily paper is modern man's form of prayer, then it is a very strange man indeed who is doing the praying today while reading about these mixed-up affairs. All of culture and all of nature get churned up again every day." (2)

1.2 Retying the Gordian Knot

"For twenty years or so, my friends and I have been studying these strange situations that the intellectual culture in which we live does not know how to categorize. For lack of better terms, we call ourselves sociologists, historians, economists, political scientists, philosophers or anthropologists. But to these venerable disciplinary labels we always add a qualifier: 'of science and technology'. 'Science studies', as Anglo-Americans call it, or 'science, technology and society'. Whatever label we use we are always attempting to retie the Gordian knot by crisscrossing, as often as we have to, the divide that separates exact knowledge and the exercise of power -- let us say nature and culture." (3)

"To shuttle back and forth, we rely on the notion of translation, or network." (3)

"None of our studies can reutilize what the sociologists, the psychologists or the economists tell us about the social context or about the subject in order to apply them to the hard sciences -- and this is why I will use the word 'collective' to describe the association of humans and nonhumans and 'society' to designate only one part of our collectives, the divide invented by the social sciences." (4)

1.3 The Crisis of the Critical Stance

"Either the networks my colleagues in science studies and I have traced do not really exist, and the critics are quite right to marginalize them or segment them into three distinct sets: facts, power, and discourse; or the networks are as we have described them, and they do cross the borders of the great fiefdoms of criticism: they are neither objective nor social, nor are they effects of discourse, even though they are real, and collective, and discursive." (6)

"Yes, the scientific facts are indeed constructed, but they cannot be reduced to the social dimension because this dimension is populated by objects mobilized to construct it. Yes, those objects are real but they look so much like social actors that they cannot be reduced to the reality 'out there' invented by the philosophers of science." (6)

"Either it is impossible to do an anthropological analysis of the modern world -- and then there is every reason to ignore those voices claiming to have a homeland to offer the sociotechnological networks; or it is possible to do an anthropological analysis of the modern world -- but then the very definition of the modern world has to be altered." (7)

"If the modern world in its turn is becoming susceptible to anthropological treatment, this is because something has happened to it." (8)

1.4 1989: The Year of Miracles

ravages produced by modernization (both the socialist experiment and technological advancement) cause three reactions: anti-modern retrenchment, postmodern detachment, or resolute (if outmoded) determination to be modern nonetheless

"And what if we had never been modern? Comparative anthropology would then be possible. The networks would have a place of their own." (10)

1.5 What Does It Mean to Be a Modern?

uses of "modern" carry implications of one-way passage of time, and of victors in some temporal battle; "If so many of our contemporaries are reluctant to use this adjective today, if we qualify it with prepositions, it is because we feel less confident in our ability to maintain that double asymmetry: we can no longer point to time's irreversible arrow, nor can we award a prize to the winners" (10).

"The hypothesis of this essay is that the word 'modern' designates two sets of entirely different practices which must remain distinct if they are to remain effective, but have recently begun to be confused. The first set of practices, by 'translation,' creates mixtures between entirely new types of beings, hybrids of nature and culture. The second, by 'purification,' creates two entirely distinct ontological zones: that of human beings on the one hand; that of nonhumans on the other. Without the first set, the practices of purification would be fruitless or pointless. Without the second, the work of translation would be slowed down, limited, or even ruled out." (10-11)

"So long as we consider these two practices of translation and purification separately, we are truly modern.... As soon as we direct our attention simultaneously to the work of purification and the work of hybridization, we immediately stop being wholly modern, and our future begins to change. At the same time we stop having been modern, because we become retrospectively aware that the two sets of practices have always already been at work in the historical period that is ending." (11)

"if we have stopped being modern, if we can no longer separate the work of proliferation from the work of purification, what are we going to become? Can we aspire to Enlightenment without modernity?" (12)

2. CONSTITUTION

2.1 The Modern Constitution

how to create an anthropology/ethnology of the modern? via the production of a Constitution explaining how its multiple branches work together in one government

2.2 Boyle and His Objects

"Far from 'situating Boyle's scientific works in their social context' or showing how politics 'presses in upon' scientific doctrines, they examine how Boyle and Hobbes fought to invent a science, a context, and a demarcation between the two." (16)

"Instead of seeking to ground his work in logic, mathematics, or rhetoric, Boyle relied on a parajuridical metaphor: credible, trustworthy, well-to-do witnesses gathered at the scene of the action can attest to the existence of a fact, the matter of fact, even if they do not know its true nature. So he invented the empirical style that we still use today" (18)

"We know the nature of facts because we have developed them in circumstances that are under our complete control. Our weakness becomes a strength, provided that we limit knowledge to the instrumentalized nature of the facts and leave aside the interpretation of causes." (18)

2.3 Hobbes and His Subjects

Hobbes's Leviathan attempts to prevent continued civil war by eliminating supernatural entities that can be appealed to as a source of truth; "Hobbes wanted to wipe the slate clean of all appeals to entities higher than civil authority" (19)

this even applies to the Sovereign's own power: "the Sovereign is never anything but an Actor designated by the social contract. There is no divine law or higher agency that the Sovereign might invoke in order to act as he wishes and dismantle the Leviathan.... Hobbes even rules out turning his own science of State into an invocation of transcendence." (19)

"All the elements are now in place for the confrontation between Hobbes and Boyle. After Hobbes has reduced and reunified the Body Politic, along comes the Royal Society to divide everything up again: some gentlemen proclaim the right to have an independent opinion, in a closed space, the laboratory, over which the State has no control." (20)

2.4 The Mediation of the Laboratory

in focusing on the role of the vacuum pump, "The practice of fabricating objects is restored to the dominant place it had lost with the modern critical stance" (21)

"the most fundamental aspect of our culture, since Boyle's day...: we live in communities whose social bond comes from objects fabricated in laboratories; ideas have been replaced by practices, apodeictic reasoning by a controlled doxa, and universal agreement by a group of colleagues." (21)

"the essential characteristic of modern power: the change in scale and the displacements that are presupposed by laboratory work" (22)

2.5 The Testimony of Nonhumans

"Here in Boyle's text we witness the intervention of a new actor recognized by the new Constitution: inert bodies, incapable of will and bias but capable of showing, signing, writing, and scribbling on laboratory instruments before trustworthy witnesses. These nonhumans, lacking souls but endowed with meaning, are even more reliable than ordinary mortals, to whom will is attributed by who lack the capacity to indicate phenomena in a reliable way." (23)

2.6 The Double Artifact of the Laboratory and the Leviathan

"If science is based on forms of life, practices, laboratories and networks, then where is it to be situated? Certainly not on the side of things-in-themselves, since the facts are fabricated. But it cannot be situated, either, on the side of the subject -- or whatever name one wants to give this side: society, brain, spirit, language game, epistemes or culture.... Must we then places the practice of science right in the middle of the line that connects the Object Pole to the Subject Pole?" (25)

"even though Shapin and Schaffer take great care to use the expression 'scientific fact' not as a resource but rather as a historical and political invention, they take no such precautions where political language itself is concerned. They use the words 'power,' 'interest' and 'politics' in all innocence. Yet who invented these words, with their modern meaning? Hobbes!" (26)

"If nature and epistemology are not made up of transhistoric entities, then neither are history and sociology" (27)

2.7 Scientific Representation and Political Representation

"Boyle is not simply creating a scientific discourse while Hobbes is doing the same thing for politics; Boyle is creating a political discourse from which politics is to be excluded, while Hobbes is imagining a scientific politics from which experimental science has to be excluded. In other words, they are inventing our modern world, a world in which the representation of things through the intermediary of the laboratory is forever dissociated from the representation of citizens through the intermediary of the social contract.... The word 'representation' is the same, but the controversy between Hobbes and Boyle renders any likeness between the two senses of the word unthinkable." (27)

"They are like a pair of Founding Fathers, acting in concert to promote one and the same innovation in political theory: the representation of nonhumans belongs to science, but science is not allowed to appeal to politics; the representation of citizens belongs to politics, but politics is not allowed to have any relation to the nonhumans produced and mobilized by science and technology." (28)

"Does the Sovereign speak in his own name, or in the name of those who empower him? ... It is indeed the Sovereign who speaks, but it is the citizens who are speaking through him.... The Leviathan is made up only of citizens, calculations, agreements or disputes. In short, it is made up of nothing but social relations" (28)

"Scientists are scrupulous representatives of the facts. Who is speaking when they speak? The facts themselves, beyond all question, but also their authorized spokespersons. Who is speaking, then, nature or human beings?" (28)

"In themselves, facts are mute; natural forces are brute mechanisms. Yet the scientists declare that they themselves are not speaking; rather, facts speak for themselves." (28-29)

"The political spokespersons come to represent the quarrelsome and calculating multitude of citizens; the scientific spokespersons come to represent the mute and material multitude of objects. The former translate their principals, who cannot all speak at once; the latter translate their constituents, who are mute from birth." (29)

2.8 The Constitutional Guarantees of the Moderns

"If the modern Constitution invents a separation between the scientific power charged with representing things and the political power charged with representing subjects, let us not draw the conclusion that from now on subjects are far removed from things. On the contrary." (29)

guarantees offered by this Constitution: "it is not men who make Nature; Nature has always existed and has always already been there; we are only discovering its secrets... human beings, and only human beings, are the ones who construct society and freely determine their own destiny." (30)

"If, after the fashion of modern political philosophy, we consider these two guarantees separately, they remain incomprehensible. If Nature is not made by or for human beings, then it remains foreign, forever remote and hostile.... Symmetrically, if society is made only by and for humans, the Leviathan, an artificial creature of which we are at once the form and the matter, cannot stand up." (30-31)

In order to avoid contradiction, they add a third guarantee: "there shall exist a complete separation between the natural world (constructed, nevertheless, by man) and the social world (sustained, nevertheless, by things); secondly, there shall exist a total separation between the work of hybrids and the work of purification" (31)

2.9 The Fourth Guarantee: The Crossed-out God

"No one is truly modern who does not agree to keep God from interfering with Natural Law as well as with the laws of the Republic." (33)

"the right was nevertheless reserved to appeal to that transcendence in case of conflict between the laws of Nature and those of Society. Modern men and women could thus be atheists even while remaining religious." (33)

"Spirituality was invented: the all-powerful God could descend into men's heart of hearts without intervening in any way in their external affairs." (33)

"A threefold transcendence and a threefold immanence in a crisscrossed schema that locks in all the possibilities: this is where I locate the power of the moderns. They have not made Nature; they make Society; they make Nature; they have not made Society; they have not made either, God has made everything; God has made nothing, they have made everything." (34)

"The essential point of this modern COnstitution is that it renders the work of mediation that assembles hybrids invisible, unthinkable, unrepresentable... _the modern Constitution allows the expanded proliferation of the hybrids whose existence, whose very possibility, it denies_." (34)

2.10 The Power of the Modern Critique

"Freed from religious bondage, the moderns could criticize the obscurantism of the old powers by revealing the material causality that those powers dissimulated -- even as they invented those very phenomena in the artificial enclosure of the laboratory." (35)

"precise knowledge of society and its laws made it possible to criticize not only the biases of ordinary obscurantism but also the new biases created by the natural sciences" (35)

"The invincible moderns even found themselves able to combine the two critical moves by using the natural sciences to debunk the false pretension of power and using the certainties of the human sciences to uncover the false pretensions of the natural sciences, and of scientism. Total knowledge was finally within reach. If it seemed impossible, for so long, to get past Marxism, this was because Marxism interwove the two most powerful resources ever developed for the modern critique, and bound them together for all time." (36)

"Anyone who has never felt this dual power vibrate within, anyone who has never been obsessed by the distinction between rationality and obscurantism, between false ideology and true science, has never been modern." (36)

"Solidly grounded in the transcendental certainty of nature's laws, the modern man or woman can criticize and unveil, denounce and express indignation at irrational beliefs and unjustified dominations. Solidly grounded in the certainty that humans make their own destiny, the modern man or woman can criticize and unveil, express indignation at and denounce irrational beliefs, the biases of ideologies, and the unjustified domination of the experts who claim to have staked out the limits of action and freedom." (36)

"The critical power of the moderns lies in this double language: they can mobilize Nature at the heart of social relationships, even as they leave Nature infinitely remote from human beings; they are free to make and unmake their society, even as they render its laws ineluctable, necessary and absolute." (37)

2.11 The Invincibility of the Moderns

"What better way to extend collectives than by bringing them into alliance both with Nature's transcendence and with all of human freedom, while at the same time incorporating Nature and imposing absolute limits on the boundaries of freedom? This makes it possible to do anything -- and its opposite." (37-38)

2.12 What the Constitution Clarifies and What It Obscures

"the price the moderns paid for this freedom was that they remained unable to conceptualize themselves in continuity with the premoderns. They had to think of themselves as absolutely different, they had to invent the Great Divide because the entire work of mediation escapes the constitutional framework that simultaneously outlines it and denies its existence." (39-40)

steps back from suggestion that modernity is false consciousness

"By rendering mixtures unthinkable, by emptying, sweeping, cleaning and purifying the arena that is opened in the central space defined by their three sources of power, the moderns allowed the practice of mediation to recombine all possible monsters without letting them have any effect on the social fabric, or even any contact with it." (42)

"The less the moderns think they are blended, the more they blend. The more science is absolutely pure, the more it is intimately bound up with the fabric of society." (43)

2.13 The End of Denunciation

"I am thus trying the tricky move to unveil the modern Constitution without resorting to the modern type of debunking." (43)

"To strip moderns of their indignation is to deprive them, it seems, of all self-respect." (44)

"To unmask: that was our sacred task, the task of us moderns. To reveal the true calculations underlying the false consciousnesses, or the true interests underlying the false calculations." (44)

"The denouncer is the brother of the ordinary people he claimed to be denouncing. Instead of really believing it, we now experience the work of denunciation as a 'historical modality' which certainly influences our affairs but does not explain them any more than the revolutionary modality explained the process of the events of 1789. Today, denunciation and revolution have both gone stale." (44-45)

"Are we devoid of any moral foundation once denunciation has been exhausted? But underneath moral judgment by denunciation, another moral judgment has always functioned by triage and selection. It is called arrangement, combination, _combinazione_ combine, but also negotiation or compromise. Charles Péguy used to say that a supple morality is infinitely more exigent than a rigid morality" (45)

2.14 We Have Never Been Modern

"By claiming that the modern Constitution does not permit itself to be understood, by proposing to reveal the practices that allow it to exist, by asserting that the critical mechanism has outlived its usefulness, am I behaving as though we were entering a new era that would follow the era of the moderns? Would I then be, literally, postmodern? Postmodernism is a symptom, not a fresh solution." (46)

"I am not saying that we are entering a new era; on the contrary, we no longer have to continue the headlong flight of the post-post-postmodernists; we are no longer obliged to cling to the avant-garde of the avant-garde; we no longer seek to be even cleverer, even more critical, even deeper into the 'era of suspicion.' No, instead we discover that we have never begun to enter the modern era." (47)

"At the very moment when the twin Enlightenments of Marxism seemed to have explained everything, at the very moment when the failure of their total explanation leads the postmoderns to founder in the despair of self-criticism, we discover that the explanations had not yet begun, and that this has always been the case; that we have never been modern, or critical; that there has never been a yesteryear or an Old Regime; that we have never really left the old anthropological matrix behind, and that it could not have been otherwise." (47)

"Seen as networks, however, the modern world, like revolutions, permits scarcely anything more than small extensions of practices, slight accelerations in the circulation of knowledge, a tiny extension of societies, minuscule increases in the number of actors, small modifications of old beliefs." (48)

3. Revolution

3.1 The Moderns, Victims of Their Own Success

"The modern Constitution has collapsed under its own weight, submerged by the mixtures that it tolerated as material for experimentation because it simultaneously dissimulated their impact upon the fabric of society. The third estate ends up being too numerous to feel that it is faithfully represented either by the order of objects or by the order of subjects." (49)

3.2 What Is a Quasi-Object?

"define what, following Michel Serres, I shall call quasi-objects, quasi-subjects" (51)

"Quasi-objects are much more social, much more fabricated, much more collective than the 'hard' parts of nature, but they are in  no way the arbitrary receptacles of a full-fledged society. On the other hand they are much more real, nonhuman and objective than those shapeless screens on which society - for unknown reasons - needed to be 'projected'." (55)

3.3 Philosophies Stretched Over the Yawning Gap

"How have the major philosophies attempted to absorb both the modern Constitution and the quasi-objects... three principal strategies. The first consists in establishing a great gap between objects and subjects and continually increasing the distance between them; the second, known as the 'semiotic turn,' focuses on the middles and abandons the extremes; the third isolates the idea of Being, thus rejecting the whole divide between objects, discourse, and subjects." (55-56)

"by believing that he was abolishing Kant's separation between things-in-themselves and the subject, Hegel brought the separation even more fully to life" (57)

3.4 The End of Ends

"If anyone has ever picked the wrong enemy, it is surely this displaced twentieth-century Kantianism that attempts to widen the abyss between the objects known by the subject on the one hand, and communicational reason on the other" (60)

"There is only one positive thing to be said about the postmoderns: after them, there is nothing. Far from being the last word, they mark the end of ends - that is, the end of ways of ending and of moving on that led to the succession, at an ever more vertiginous rate, of ever more radical and revolutionary critiques." (62)

"But it is no more in their power to end history than it is not to be naive. They are simply stuck in the impasse of all avant-gardes that have no more troops behind them." (62)

3.5 Semiotic Turns

"While the modernizing philosophies were doing the splits between the two poles of the Constitution in order to absorb the proliferation of quasi-objects, another strategy was being put in place to seize the middle ground, whose dimensions were continuing to expand. Instead of concentrating on the extremes of the work of purification, this strategy concentrated on one of its mediations, language." (62)

"If they too have led us into an impasse, it is not because they have 'forgotten man,' or 'abandoned reference,' as the modernist reaction is declaring today, but because they themselves have limited their enterprise to discourse alone." (63)

"The great weakness of these philosophies, however, is to render more difficult the connections between an autonomized discourse and what they had provisionally shelved: the referent - on Nature's side - and the speaker - on the side of society/subject." (63-64)

"From this crucial turning point, we have learned that the only way to escape from the parallel traps of naturalization and sociologization consists in granting language its autonomy. Without it, how could we deploy that median space between natures and societies so as to accommodate quasi-objects, quasi-subjects?" (64)

3.6 Who Has Forgotten Being?

"Who has forgotten Being? No one, no one ever has, otherwise Nature would be truly available as a pure 'stock.' Look around you: scientific objects are circulating simultaneously as subjects objects and discourse. Networks are full of Being. As for machines, they are laden with subjects and collectives.... Has someone, however, actually forgotten Being? Yes: anyone who really thinks that Being has really been forgotten." (66)

"If, scorning empiricism, you opt out of the exact sciences, then the human sciences, then traditional philosophy, then the sciences of language, and you hunker down in your forest - then you will indeed feel a tragic loss. But what is missing is you yourself, not the world!" (66)

3.7 The Beginning of the Past

four critical resources used in maintaining the modern Constitution: "naturalization, sociologization, discursivization, and finally the forgetting of Being.... In order to exit from the postmoderns' paralysis, it suffices to reutilize all these resources, but they must be pieced together and put to work in shadowing quasi-objects or networks" (67)

"By seeking to harbour quasi-objects at the same time as their Constitution, we are obliged to consider the temporal framework of the moderns. Since we refuse to pass 'after' the postmods, we cannot propose to return to a nonmodern world that we have never left, without a modification in the passage of time itself." (67-68)

"Calendar time may well situate events with respect to a regulated series of dates, but historicity situates the same events with respect to their intensity." (68)

"The modern passage of time is nothing but a particular form of historicity. Where do we get the idea that time passes? From the modern Constitution itself.... Let us call the interpretation of this passage temporality, in order to distinguish it carefully from time." (68)

"As Nietzsche observed long ago, the moderns suffer from the illness of historicism. They want to keep everything, date everything, because they think they have definitively broken with their past.... But are we as far removed from our past as we want to think we are? No, because modern temporality does not have much effect on the passage of time. The past remains, therefore, and even returns." (69)

"for the moderns - as for their antimodern enemies, as well as for their false postmodern enemies - time's arrow is unambiguous: one can go forward, but then one must break with the past; one can choose to go backward, but then one has to break with the modernizing avant-gardes, which have broken radically with their own past.... If there is one thing we are incapable of carrying out, we now know, it is a revolution, whether it be in science, technology, politics, or philosophy. But we are still modern when we interpret this fact as a disappointment, as if archaism had invaded everything, as if there no longer existed any public dump where we could pile up the repressed material behind us. We are still postmodern when we attempt to rise above this disappointment by juxtaposing in a collage elements from all times - elements that are all equally outdated and outmoded." (69)

3.8 The Revolutionary Miracle

"Modern time is a succession of inexplicable apparitions attributable to the distinction between the history of sciences or technologies and just plain history.... The idea of radical revolution is the only solution the moderns have imagined to explain the emergence of the hybrids that their Constitution simultaneously forbids and allows, and in order to avoid another monster: the notion that things themselves have a history." (70)

"_The asymmetry between nature and culture then becomes an asymmetry between past and future. The past was the confusion of things and men; the future is what will no longer confuse them._ Modernization consists in continually exiting from an obscure age that mingled the needs of society with scientific truth, in order to enter into a new age that will finally distinguish clearly what belongs to atemporal nature and what comes from humans, what depends on things and what belongs to signs." (71)

3.9 The End of the Passing Past

"What is the source of the very modern impression that we are living a new time that breaks with the past?... The impression of passing irreversibly is generated only when we bind together the cohort of elements that make up our day-to-day universe." (72)

"Entities have to be made contemporary by moving in step and have to be replaced by other things equally well aligned if time is to become a flow." (72)

"This beautiful order is disturbed once the quasi-objects are seen as mixing up different periods, ontologies or genres.... Instead of a fine laminary flow, we will most often get a turbulent flow of whirlpools and rapids. Time becomes reversible instead of irreversible." (73)

"The proliferation of quasi-objects has exploded modern temporality along with its Constitution." (73)

"postmodernism is a symptom, not a solution.... By mixing elements of the past together in the form of collages and citations, the postmoderns recognize to what extent these citations are truly outdated.... But it is a long way from a provocative quotation extracted out of a truly finished past to a reprise, repetition or revisiting of a past that has never disappeared." (74)

3.10 Triage and Multiple Times

"If we can no longer progress in the fashion of the moderns, must we regress in the fashion of the antimoderns? No, we have to pass from one temporality to the other, since a temporality, in itself, has nothing temporal about it. It is a means of connecting entities and filing them away." (75)

"One is not born traditional; one chooses to become traditional by constant innovation. The idea of an identical repetition of the past and that of a radical rupture with any past are two symmetrical results of a single conception of time. We cannot return to the past, to tradition, to repetition, because these great immobile domains are the inverted image of the earth that is no longer promised to us today: progress, permanent revolution, modernization, forward flight. // What are we to do, if we can move neither forward nor backward? Displace our attention. We have never moved either forward or backward. We have always actively sorted out elements belonging to different times. We can still sort. _It is the sorting that makes the times, not the times that make the sorting._" (76)

3.11 A Copernican Counter-revolution

"How can we move from transcendent/immanent Nature to a nature that is still just as real, but extracted from the scientific laboratory and then transformed into external reality? How can we shift from immanent/transcendent Society toward collectives of humans and nonhumans?... How are we to gain access to networks, those beings whose topology is so odd and whose ontology is even more unusual, beings that possess both the capacity to connect and the capacity to divide -- that is, the capacity to produce both time and space?" (77)

"An intermediary -- although recognized as necessary -- simply transports, transfers, transmits energy from one of the poles of the Constitution. It is void in itself and can only be less faithful or more or less opaque. A mediator, however, is an original event and creates what it translates as well as the entities between which it plays the mediating role." (77-78)

"Instead of denying the existence of hybrids -- and reconstructing them awkwardly under the name of intermediaries -- this explanatory model allows us instead to integrate the work of purification as a particular case of mediation." (78)

"I call this reversed reversal -- or rather this shift of the extremes centreward and downward, a movement that makes both object and subject revolve around the practice of quasi-objects and mediators -- a Compernican counter-revolution.... Nature does revolve, but not around the Subject/Society. It revolves around the collective that produces things and people. The Subject does revolve, but not around Nature. It revolves around the collective out of which people and things are generated." (79)

3.12 From Intermediaries to Mediators

"In the modern perspective, Nature and Society allow explanation because they themselves do not have to be explained. Intermediaries exist, of course, and their role is precisely to establish the link between the two, but they establish links only because they themselves lack any ontological status.... If we bring about the Copernican counter-revolution we are then obliged to take the work of the intermediaries much more seriously, since it is no longer their task to transmit the power of Nature and that of Society, and since they nevertheless all produce the same reality effects." (80)

"they stop being simple, more or less faithful, intermediaries. They become mediators -- that is, actors endowed with the capacity to translate what they transport, to redefine it, redeploy it, and also to betray it." (81)

3.13 Accusation, Causation

Michel Serres: 'We want to describe the emergence of the object, not only of tools or beautiful statues, but of things in general, ontologically speaking. How does the object come to what is human?' (qtd on 82)

3.14 Variable Ontologies

"Nature and Society are not two opposite transcendences but one and the same growing out of the work of mediation." (87-88)

3.15 Connecting the Four Modern Repertoires

"The moderns have developed four different repertoires, which they see as incompatible, to accommodate the proliferation of quasi-objects. The first deals with the external reality of a nature of which we are not masters, which exists outside ourselves and has neither our passions nor our desires, even though we are capable of mobilizing and constructing it. The second deals with the social bond, with what attaches human beings to one another, with the passions and desires that move us, with the personified forces that structure society -- a society that surpasses us all, even though it is of our own making. The third deals with signification and meaning, with the actants that make up the stories we tell ourselves, with the ordeals they undergo, with the adventures they live through, with the tropes and genres that organize them, with the great narratives that dominate us infinitely, even thought they are at the same time merely texts and discourses. The fourth, finally, speaks of Being and deconstructs what we invariably forget when we concern ourselves with beings alone, even though the presence of Being is distributed among beings, is coextensive with their very existence, their very historicity." (88)

"Are you not fed up at finding yourselves forever locked into language alone, or imprisoned in social representations alone, as so many social scientists would like you to be? We want to gain access to things themselves, not only to their phenomena. The real is not remote; rather, it is accessible in all the objects mobilized throughout the world. Doesn't external reality abound right here among us? // Do you not have more than enough of being continually dominated by a Nature that is transcendent, unknowable, inaccessible, exact, and simply true, peopled with entities that lie dormant like the Sleeping Beauty until the day when scientific Prince Charmings finally discover them? The collectives we live in are more active, more productive, more socialized than the tiresome things-in-themselves led us to expect. // Are you not a little tired of those sociologies constructed around the Social only, which is supposed to hold up solely through the repetition of the words 'power' and 'legitimacy' because sociologists cannot cope either with the contents of objects or with the world of languages that nevertheless construct society? Our collectives are more real, more naturalized, more discursive than the tiresome humans-among-themselves led us to expect. // Are you not fed up with language games, and with the eternal scepticism of the deconstruction of meaning? Discourse is not a world unto itself but a population of actants that mix with things as well as with societies, uphold the former and the latter alike, and hold on to them both. Interest in texts does not distance us from reality, for things too have to be elevated to the dignity of narrative. As for texts, why deny them the grandeur of forming the social bond that holds us together? // Are you not tired of being accused of having forgotten Being, of living in a base world emptied of all substance, all its sacredness and its art? In order to rediscover these treasures, do we really have to give up the historical, scientific and social world in which we live? To apply oneself to the science, to technologies, to markets, to things, does not distance us any more from the difference of Being with beings than from society, politics, or language." (90)

4. RELATIVISM

4.1 How to End the Asymmetry

"if we link together in one single picture the work of purification and the work of mediation that gives it meaning, we discover, retrospectively, that we have never been truly modern. As a result, the anthropology that has been stumbling over science and technology up to now could once again become the model for description that I have been seeking." (91)

"If anthropology is to become comparative, if it is to be able to go back and forth between moderns and nonmoderns, it must be made symmetrical." (91-92)

"When the balance of symmetry is reestablished with precision, the discrepancy that allows us to understand why some win and others lose stands out all the more sharply." (94)

4.2 The Principle of Symmetry Generalized

"if we superpose the two positions -- the one that the ethnology occupies effortlessly in order to study cultures and the one that we have made a great effort to define in order to study our own nature -- then comparative anthropology becomes possible, if not easy. It no longer compares cultures, setting aside its own, which through some astonishing privilege possesses a unique access to universal Nature. _It compares natures-cultures_." (96)

4.3 The Import-Export System of the Two Great Divides

"In Westerners' eyes the West, and the West alone, is not a culture, not merely a culture.... We Westerners cannot be one culture among others, since we also mobilize Nature. We do not mobilize an image or a symbolic representation of Nature, the way the other societies do, but Nature as it is, or at least as it is known to the sciences" (97)

"So the Internal Great Divide accounts for the External Great Divide: we are the only ones who differentiate absolutely between Nature and Culture, between Science and Society, whereas in our eyes all the others... cannot really separate what is knowledge from what is Society, what is sign from what is thing, what comes from Nature as it is from what their cultures require.... The internal partition between humans and nonhumans defines a second partition -- an external one this time -- through which the moderns have set themselves apart from the premoderns." (99)

"Even thought we might still recognize in our own societies some fuzzy areas in madness, children, animals, popular culture and women's bodies, we believe our duty is to extirpate ourselves from those horrible mixture as forcefully as possible by no longer confusing what pertains to mere social preoccupations and what pertains to the real nature of things." (100)

4.4 Anthropology Comes Home from the Tropics

"To become symmetrical, anthropology needs a complete overhaul and intellectual retooling so that it can get around both Divides at once by believing neither in the radical distinction between humans and nonhumans at home, nor in the total overlap of knowledge and society elsewhere." (101)

4.5 There Are No Cultures

"How can one not establish a radical difference between universal Nature and relative culture? But _the very notion of culture is an artifact created by bracketing Nature off_. Cultures -- different or universal -- do not exist, any more than Nature does. There are only natures-cultures, and these offer the only possible basis for comparison." (104)

"All natures-cultures are similar in that they simultaneously construct humans, divinities and nonhumans. None of them inhabits a world of signs or symbols arbitrarily imposed on an external Nature known to us alone. None of them -- and especially not our own -- lives in a world of things. All of them sort out what will bear signs and what will not. If there is one thing we all do, it is surely that we construct both our human collectives and the nonhumans that surround them." (106)

4.6 Sizeable Differences

focus on "collectives" connecting humans and nonhumans

"All collectives are different from one another in the way they divide up beings, in the properties they attribute to them, in the mobilization they consider acceptable. These differences constitute countless small divides, and there is no longer a Great Divide to take one apart from all the others." (107)

"Such a comparison, however, respects only the conjoined production of one nature-culture, which is only one aspect of collectives. It may satisfy our sense of justice, but in various ways it encounters the same difficulty as absolute relativism, since it immediately abolishes differences by rendering them all equally different." (107)

"Even though they might be similar in the principle of their co-production, collectives may differ in size" (108) -- and thus in the ability to dominate others

"in other words, the differences are sizeable, but they are only of size. They are important (and the error of cultural relativism is that it ignores them), but they are not disproportionate (and the error of universalism is that it sets them up as a Great Divide)." (108)

"Modern knowledge and power are different not in that they would escape at last the tyranny of the social, but in that _they add many more hybrids in order to recompose the social link and extend its scale_." (109)

4.7 Archimedes' _coup d'état_

"Without geometry and statics, the Sovereign had to reckon with social forces that infinitely overpowered him. But if you add the lever of technology to the play of political representation alone, then you can become stronger than the multitude; you can attach and defend yourself." (110)

"Yes, science is indeed politics pursued by other means, means that are powerful only because they remain radically other" (111)

"It is only when we remove the nonhumans churned up by the collective that the residue, which we call society, becomes incomprehensible, because its size, its durability and its solidity no longer have a cause." (111)

4.8 Absolute Relativism and Relativist Relativism

"Moderns do differ from premoderns by this single trait: they refuse to conceptualize quasi-objects as such. In their eyes, hybrids present the horror that must be avoided at all costs by a ceaseless, even maniacal purification... this very refusal leads to the uncontrollable proliferation of a certain type of being: _the object, constructor of the social, expelled from the social world, attributed to a transcendent world that is however, not divine -- a world that produces, in contrast, a floating subject, bearer of law and morality_." (112)

"Absolute relativism, like its enemy brother rationalism, forgets that measuring instruments have to be set up... if we are to understand this task of measuring, we need to reinforce the noun with the adjective 'relativist,' which compensates for the noun's apparent foolishness. Relativist relativism restores the compatibility that was assumed to have been lost." (113)

"The universalists defined a single hierarchy. The absolute relativists made all hierarchies equal. The relativist relativists, more modest but more empirical, point out what instruments and what chains serve to create asymmetries and equalities, hierarchies and differences" (113)

"How can one claim that worlds are untranslatable, when translation is the very soul of the process of relating?" (113)

4.9 Small Mistakes Concerning the Disenchantment of the World

"Unfortunately, the difficulty of relativism does not arise only from the bracketing off of Nature. It stems also from the related belief that the modern world is truly disenchanted." (114)

"The moderns confused products with processes. They believed that the production of bureaucratic rationalization presupposed rational bureaucrats; that the production of universal science depended on universalist scientists; that the production of effective technologies led to the effectiveness of engineers; that the production of abstraction was itself abstract; that the production of formalism was itself formal." (115-16)

4.10 Even a Longer Network Remains Local at All Points

"we tend to transform the lengthened networks of Westerners into systematic and global totalities" (117)

"There are continuous paths that lead from the local to the global, from the circumstantial to the universal, from the contingent to the necessary, only so long as the branch lines are paid for." (117)

"But there is science, which always renews and totalizes and fills the gaping holes left by the networks in order to turn them into sleek, unified surfaces that are absolutely universal." (118)

4.11 The Leviathan is a Skein of Networks

"there is an Ariadne's thread that would allow us to pass with continuity from the local to the global, from the human to the nonhuman. It is the thread of networks of practices and instruments, of documents and translations." (121)

4.12 A Perverse Taste for the Margins

"We poor subject-objects, we humble societies-natures, we modest locals-globals, are literally quartered among ontological regions that define each other mutually but no longer resemble our practices." (122-23)

"The defence of marginality presupposes the existence of a totalitarian centre. But if the centre and its totality are illusions, acclaim for the margins is somewhat ridiculous." (124)

4.13 Avoid Adding New Crimes to Old

"How can moderns be restored to ordinary humanity and inhumanity without being too hastily absolved of the crimes that they are right to seek to expiate?" (125)

"With misdeeds as with domination, with capitalisms as with sciences, what we need to understand is the ordinary dimension: the small causes and their large effects." (125)

"What is to be done, then, with such sleek, filled-in surfaces, with such absolute totalities? Turn them inside-out all at once, of course; subvert them, revolutionize them - such was the strategy of those modernists _par excellence_, the Marxists.... And because this subversion was impossible, but they tried it anyway, they have gone from one crime to another." (126)

"Yet we were born amid sciences, we have known only peace and prosperity, and we love - should we admit it? - the technologies and consumer objects that the philosophers and moralists of earlier generations advise us to abhor." (126)

4.14 Transcendences Abroad

"This is the ultimate difficulty of relativism: now that comparison has become possible, in what common space do all collectives, producers of natures and societies, find themselves equally immersed?" (127)

"As long as we keep asking that question, we are unmistakably in the modern world, obsessed with the construction of one immanence or the deconstruction of another. We still remain - to use the old word - within metaphysics. Now by traversing these networks, we do not come to rest in anything particularly homogenous. We remain, rather, within an infra-physics." (128)

"we do not fall into immanence alone, since networks are immersed in nothing. We do not need a mysterious ether for them to propagate themselves. We do not need to fill in the blanks. It is the conception of the terms 'transcendence' and 'immanence' that ends up being modified by the moderns' return to nonmodernity." (128)

"Now if there is no immanence, if there are only networks, agents, actants, we cannot be disenchanted. Humans are not the ones who arbitrarily add the 'symbolic dimension' to pure material forces. These forces are as transcendent, active, agitated, spiritual, as we are." (128)

"What sort of world is it that obliges us to take into account, at the same time and in the same breath, the nature of things, technologies, sciences, fictional beings, religions large and small, politics, jurisdictions, economies, and unconsciousnesses? Our own, of course." (129)

5. REDISTRIBUTION

5.1 The Impossible Modernization

"To be sure, the moderns have always recognized that they too had blended objects and societies, cosmologies and sociologies. But this was in the past, while they were still only premodern. By increasingly terrifying revolutions, they have been able to tear themselves away from that past." (130)

"Modernization was ruthless toward the premoderns, but what can we say about postmodernization? Imperialist violence at least offered a future, but sudden weakness on the part of the conquerors is far worse for, always cut off from the past, it now also breaks with the future." (131)

5.2 Final Examinations

"What are we going to retain from the moderns? Everything, apart from exclusive confidence in the upper half of their Constitution" (132)

"Their daring, their research, their innovativeness, their tinkering, their youthful excesses, the ever-increasing scale of their action, the creation of stabilized objects independent of society, the freedom of a society liberated from objects - all these are features we want to keep" (133)

"Now that we are no longer so far removed from the premoderns - since when we talk about the premoderns we have to include a large part of ourselves - we are going to have to sort them out as well. Let us keep what is best about them, above all: the premoderns' inability to differentiate durably between the networks and the pure poles of Nature and Society, their obsessive interest in thinking about the production of hybrids of Nature and Society, of things and signs, their certainty that transcendences abound, their capacity for conceiving of past and future in many ways other than progress and decadence, the multiplication of types of nonhumans different from those of the moderns." (133)

"this is precisely the amalgam I am looking for: _to retain the production of a nature and of a society that allow changes in size through the creation of an external truth and a subject of law, but without neglecting the co-production of sciences and societies_." (134)

"We can keep the Enlightenment without modernity, provided that we reintegrate the objects of the sciences and technologies into the Constitution, as quasi-objects among many others - objects whose genesis must no longer be clandestine, but must be followed through and through, from the hot events that spawned the objects to the progressive cool-down that transforms them into essences of Nature or Society." (135)

"It has been necessary to modify the fabric of our collectives from top to bottom in order to absorb the citizen of the eighteenth century and the worker of the nineteenth. We shall have to transform ourselves just as thoroughly in order to make room, today, for the nonhumans created by science and technology." (136)

5.3 Humanism Redistributed

"So long as humanism is constructed through contrast with the object that has been abandoned to epistemology, neither the human nor the nonhuman can be understood." (136)

"Must we solemnly announce the death of man and dissolve him in the play of language, an evanescent reflection of inhuman structures that would escape all understanding? No, since we are no more in Discourse than we are in Nature. In any event, nothing is sufficiently inhuman to dissolve human beings in it and announce their death." (137)

"If the human does not possess a stable form, it is not formless for all that. If, instead of attaching it to one constitutional pole or the other, we move it closer to the middle, it becomes the mediator and even the intersection of the two." (137)

"The expression 'anthropomorphic' considerably underestimates our humanity. We should be talking about morphism... [Morphisms] are what define the _anthropos_. A weaver of morphisms - isn't that enough of a definition?" (137)

"How could the _anthropos_ be threatened by machines? It has made them, it has put itself into them, it has divided up its own members among their members, it has built its own body with them. How could it be threatened by objects? They have been quasi-subjects circulating within the collective they traced. It is made of them as much as they are made of it." (137-38)

"Where does the threat come from? From those who seek to reduce it to an essence and who - by scorning things, objects, machines, and the social, by cutting off all delegations and senders - make humanism a fragile and precious thing at risk of being overwhelmed by Nature, Society, or God." (138)

5.4 The Nonmodern Constitution

"We have committed ourselves to providing representation for quasi-objects.... Nature and Society are not two distinct poles, but one and the same production of successive states of societies-natures, of collectives. The first guarantee of our new draft thus becomes the nonseparability of quasi-objects, quasi-subjects.... The work of mediation becomes the very centre of the double power, natural and social." (139)

"Now we seek to keep the moderns major innovation: the separability of a nature that no one has constructed - transcendence - and the freedom of manoeuvre of a society that is of our own making - immanence." (140)

"Nature's transcendence, its objectivity, and Society's immanence, it subjectivity, stem from the work of mediation without depending on their separation, contrary to what the Constitution of the moderns claims." (140)

"The second guarantee of our new draft thus makes it possible to recover the first two guarantees of the modern Constitution but without separating them. All concepts, all institutions, all practices that interfere with the progressive objectivization of Nature - incorporation into a black box - and simultaneously the subjectivization of Society - freedom of manoeuvre - will be deemed harmful, dangerous and, quite simply, immoral." (140)

"The third guarantee, as important as the others, is that we can combine associations freely without ever confronting the choice between archaism and modernization, the local and the global, the cultural and the universal, the natural and the social." (141)

"The fourth guarantee - perhaps the most important - is to replace the clandestine proliferation of hybrids by their regulated and commonly-agreed-upon production. It is time, perhaps, to speak of democracy again, but of a democracy extended to things themselves." (142)

5.5 The Parliament of Things

"When we amend the Constitution, we continue to believe in the sciences, but instead of taking in their objectivity, their truth, their coldness, their extraterritoriality - qualities they have never had, except after the arbitrary withdrawal of epistemology - we retain what has always been most interesting about them: their daring, their experimentation, their uncertainty, their warmth, their incongruous blend of hybrids, their crazy ability to reconstitute the social bond. We take away from them only the mystery of their birth and the danger their clandestineness posed to democracy." (142)
