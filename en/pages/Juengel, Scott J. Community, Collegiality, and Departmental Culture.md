Juengel, Scott J. "Community, Collegiality, and Departmental Culture." ADE Bulletin, no. 134-135, Spring-Fall 2003, 29-33.

"In what follows I want to think about departments as complex communities wherein members regularly contend for power, recognition, autonomy, and respect and into which new faculty members often arrive unprepared for the diplomatic challenges that naturally ensue as a result." (29)

"to move from graduate school to our first faculty position is to become deeply enmeshed in institutional prerogatives and departmental histories that in most cases precede our arrival by decades." (29)

"Even the most congenial departments are a complicated network of crisscrossing social intimacies, political identifications, and methodological allegiances, not to mention the standard divisions of rank, discipline, and field." (30)

"I put this in terms of relevance rather than something like power, reputation, or merit, because I'm committed to understanding our place in a professional community as one of continuous adaptation to shifting norms: relevance is neither a thing you possess nor a distinction you can grant yourself." (30)

"given that the humanities generally operate under the sign of urgency and contestation, maintaining a critical relation to hegemonic structures is seemingly impossible to avoid, perhaps even necessary to survive." (30); on into Readings and "community of dissensus"

"But since entering the tenure track, I have seen instances where 'collegiality' has joined the holy trinity of research, teaching, and service as a category of and for assessment" (31)

"So even as collegiality acknowledges and anticipates our contentious work (and presumably our legendarily surly natures), it also offers an ill-defined and manipulable standard of comportment that need not pertain to its own adjudication: what, in the end, would a collegial evaluation of collegiality look like? Or worse, an uncollegial assessment of one's collegiality?" (31)

"I'm not opposed to the idea that we are obligated to conduct ourselves with an honest measure of decency and generosity" (31)

"It is in this strange formulation whereby collegiality is at once both reified and equally, always, elusive and manipulable, that the promise of collegial behavior gets short-circuited: those who have tenure have presumably achieved some measure of collegiality and now pass judgment in its name. At this point they themselves are no longer held to its high standard, and we cease to be colleagues in the best sense of the word." (32)
