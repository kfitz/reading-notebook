"In the world of remote relays made possible by digital and electronic communications, texts are no longer prisoners of their original physical, material existence. Separated from objects, texts can be transmitted; there is no longer a necessary connection between the place in which they are conserved and the place in which they are read. The opposition, long held to be insurmountable, between the closed world of any finite collection and the infinite universe of all the texts ever written is thus theoretically annihilated: now the catalog of all catalogs, ideally listing the totality of written production, corresponds to electronic access to texts universally available for consultation." (Chartier 48)

"If texts are emancipated from the form that has conveyed them since the first centuries of the Christian era -- the codex, the book composed of signatures from which all printed objects with which we are familiar derive -- by the same token all intellectual technologies and all operations working to produce meaning become similarly modified.... When it passes from the codex to the monitor screen the "same" text is no longer truly the same because the new formal mechanisms that deliver it to the reader modify the conditions of its reception and its comprehension." (Chartier 48-49)

"In the form it has acquired in Western Europe since the beginning of the Christian era, the book has been one of the most powerful metaphors used for conceiving of the cosmos, nature, and the human body. If the object that has furnished the matrix of this repertory of images (poetic, philosophical, scientific) should disappear, the references and the procedures that organize the 'readability' of the physical world, equated with a book in codex form, would be profoundly upset as well." (Chartier 49)
