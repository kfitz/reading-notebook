Hall, Stuart.  “Signification, Representation, Ideology:  Althusser and the Post-Structuralist Debates.”  Critical Studies in Mass Communication 2.2 (June 1985): 91-114.


“Althusser persuaded me, and I remain persuaded, that Marx conceptualizes the ensemble of relations which make up a society — Marx’s “totality” — as essentially a complex structure, not a simple one.” (Hall 91)

structure in dominance; impossible to reduce one level of practice to another in some easy way

Althusser and theorization of difference

ideology = articulation (means of fixing meaning)

contradiction and overdetermination

classical marxist concept of determination: ultimately, all controlled by economic

from “necessary corrspondence” (classical) to “necessarily no correspondence” (discourse theory)

Hall:  no necessary correspondence — “marxism without guarantees”

Althusser on ideology:  opposed to class reductionism in ideology; critical of notion of “false consciousness”

ideological state apparatuses:  relationship between ideology and other social practices

function of ideology: to reproduce social relations of production; superstructures

ideology here is generally ruling ideology — A. open to charge of “creeping marxist functionalism” — ideology performs its function with no counter-tendencies

ideology = practice

what about ideas? mental events realized as social phenomena in language; material existence of ideas/ideology in the rituals and practices of ISAs

ideology only exists by virtue of the constituting category of the “subject”; interpellation

two-part structure of essay; reproduction of relations of production; ideology and the subject — later theory has picked up part two, but forgotten part one

“Marxism and Humanism” — ideologies as systems of representation (concepts, ideas, myths, images) in which men and women live their imaginary relations to the real conditions of existence

no social practice outside ideology; but all practices are not nothing but ideology
