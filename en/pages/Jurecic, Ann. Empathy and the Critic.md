Jurecic, Ann. "Empathy and the Critic." College English, vol. 74, no. 1, Sept. 2011, 10-27.

"Empathy is suddenly hot in the academy -- as a topic of inquiry, if not a professional practice." (10)

"there is a surprising level of agreement, from educators to politicians and philosophers, and even talk show hosts, that *reading literature* makes us more empathic" (10)

Explores the “strong stance against readerly empathy” (11) taken by several key authors, including Ahmed, Berlant

“They argue that affects such as empathy — as well as love, shame, disgust, terror, and happiness — are more than personal. Such affects have histories and lend force to ideologies, political movements, and cultures. Recent work in affect theory therefore warns us to be wary of the fellow feeling associated with social emotions, such as empathy, sympathy, compassion, and pity. Although these social emotions may seem authentically personal, we are warned, they can be expressions of power, appropriations of others’ experience, and falsely oversimplified understandings of social and cultural relationships.” (11)

"such identification can prevent one from recognizing one's own complicity with the social and political structures that engender this violence. In sum, empathy is dangerous: it placates the privileged and obscures 'the cultural politics of emotion'" (11, quoting Ahmed, *Cultural Politics*)

"I argue that educators need to release their hold on the supposition that reading enriches empathic concern because, in fact, there is little clear evidence that reading changes behavior beyond the private encounter with the book. At the same time, I contend that skeptical critics must question their own conviction that empathic responses to literature are necessarily simplistic and naive." (12)

"as educators, if we want our students to understand the potential as well as the problems of empathy, we should neither assume students will become attuned to others simply by reading nor insist that readerly empathy is always illegitimate. Instead, we should emphsize that empathy is multidimensional, flawed, fascinating, and inescapably -- for better *and* worse -- at the heart of social relationships." (12)

"In [Martha] Nussbaum's view, 'empathic imagining' that is exercised in private reading may be fallible, inconsistent, and incomplete, but it remains 'an invaluable way of extending our enthical awareness and of understanding the human meaning of events and policies.' Empathy, in her argument, is not a spontaneous reaction, but a habitual practice, cultivated and elevated to the service of citizenship and community." (14, quoting Nussbaum, *Poetic Justice* and *Cultivating Humanity*)

"The social solidarity generated by novels is not the old humanism in disguise, Rorty maintains: 'It is to be achieved not by inquiry but by imagination, the imaginative ability to see strange people as fellow sufferers'" (15, quoting Rorty, *Contingency, Irony, Solidarity*)

findings of Suzanne Keen in *Empathy and the Novel*: "Readers do report that they value the experience of empathy in reading, but they tend to choose books containing characters or plots with which they identify beforehand.... because reading is a private transacttion between a reader and a book, readerly empathy differs profoundly from social empathy. When reading for pleasure, we are released from social obligations and need not put up the protective barriers of suspicion or skepticism." (15)

"we don't yet know how to teach the transfer from reading to empathy and then to action." (16)

"For scholars trained in what Paul Ricoeur called the *hermeneutics of suspicion*, the idea that one can, through reading, try on the experience of another and thereby understand that person's experience cognitively and emotionally is absurdly simplistic." (16; "hermeneutics of suspicion" is from *Freud and Philosophy*)

"Among the most influential critics of the enervating political effects of novels and reading practices that generate empathy, sympathy, or other such affects is Raymond Williams, who maintains in *Culture and Society* that common readings of nineteenth-century industrial novels led to a 'recognition of evil,' but that this 'was balanced by fear of becoming involved.' 'Sympathy was transformed,' he writes, 'not into action, but into withdrawal.'" (17)

"According to Berlant, sentimentality creates the illusion that identification with a person who suffers allows one, through feeling, to transcend structural problems such as racism and sexism. But this is a false transcendence, Berlant tells us, for 'witnessing and identifying with pain, consuming and deriving pleasure and moral self-satisfaction' does not change the world." (17, quoting Berlant, "Poor Eliza")

For Berlant, "[e]mpathy is an unexamined emotional response to the experience of others, a form of false identification and flawed knowledge that disregards distance and difference." (17)

"It would be a greater benefit to readers, in my view, to see *Beloved* as part of a continuing cultural conversation about empathy than to relegate the novel to the separate category of postsentimental literature." (18)

"Morrison does not allow us to feel that we know Sethe. But her reimagining of Margaret Garner's story is itself an empathic act, and the fiction she creates invites readers to experience the interplay of connection, distance, and difference, knowing that their understanding will always be incomplete and imperfect.... This exercise of empathy -- thoughtful, respectful, slow, and aware of distance and constraints -- is, in my view, more reflective of experience than affect theorists' arguments that empathy is always and only self-satisfied and passive; and it is more complex than the empathy that many readers and English educators assume is naturally engendered by literature." (19)

"the Levinasian idea of the face as the foundation of ethics: in order to acknowledge and respond to the face of another, one must see in that face the fragility of the other's life" (20)

"Empathy is not salvation; it's not certainty or knowledge; it blurs boundaries in ways that can be both generative and destructive. In the end, empathy is a *practice*, a process that extends in time. To make it work takes both effort and humility." (22)

"With such sophisticated engagements with empathy readily available, why do arguments that represent empathy as either redeeming or oppressive hold so much sway? These opposed positions are so compelling, I believe, because they affirm the social and political value of literature and criticism at a time when their status is diminishing both in the academy and in society at large." (22)

"In *Why We Read Fiction*, Lisa Zunshine writes that one of the primary pleasures of reading fiction is to observe how characters read and misread one another's interior states." (23)

"The novel and the memoir both suggest that the lived complexity of empathy cannot be reduced to an outcome to be assessed, a feeling to be argued out of, or a neurological response. For those writers, empathy is instead an inexhaustible subject for the practices of contemplation, exploration, and creation. Literature matters, their work suggests, not because it changes our brains, hearts, souls, or political convictions, but because the practice of reading literature slows thought down." (24)

"rather than assess literary study on the basis of whether it teaches a certain type of behavior, what if we assessed the integrity of our institutions and communities by whether they make time for the kind of self- and community-sustaining practices long made available by the arts and literature? If respectful, thoughtful, and humane ways of being, thinking, and acting are valued elements of institutional culture, then we will have, at the very least, created the conditions where students can both be introduced to the complexity of empathy and experience it as a daily practice." (24)
