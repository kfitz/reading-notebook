Anderson, Chris. The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. New York: Hyperion, 2006.


"Think of these falling distribution costs as a dropping waterline or a receding tide.  As they fall, they reveal a new land that has been there all along, just underwater.  These niches are a great uncharted expanse of products that were previously uneconomic to offer." (Anderson 6)

"Scarcity requires hits -- if there are only a few slots on the shelves or the airwaves, it's only sensible to fill them with the titles that will sell best.  And if that's all that's available, that's all people will buy. 
"But what if there are infinite slots?  Maybe hits are the wrong way to look at the business.  There are, after all, a lot more non-hits than hits, and now both are equally available.  What if the non-hits -- from healthy niche product to outright misses -- all together added up to a market as big as, if not bigger than, the hits themselves?  The answer to that was clear: It would radically transform some of the largest markets in the world." (Anderson 8)

"Seen broadly, it's clear that the story of the Long Tail is really about the economics of abundance -- what happens when the bottlenecks that stand between supply and demand in our culture start to disappear and everything becomes available to everyone." (Anderson 11)

"Simply offering more variety, however, does not shift demand by itself.  Consumers must be given ways to find niches that suit their particular needs and interests.  A range of tools and techniques -- from recommendations to rankings -- are effective at doing this.  These 'filters' can drive demand down the Tail." (Anderson 53)

three forces affecting the growth of the long tail:  "democratizing the tools of production" (Anderson 54), which "lengthens" the tail; "cutting the costs of consumption by democratizing distribution" (Anderson 55), which "fattens" the tail; "connecting supply and demand" (Anderson 55), which shifts the center of gravity from hits to niches

on Wikipedia:  "this is not how encyclopedias are supposed to be made.  From the beginning, compiling authoritative knowledge has been the job of scholars." (Anderson 65)

"When professionals -- editors, academics, journalists -- are running the show, we at least know that it's someone's job to look out for such things as accuracy.  But now we're depending more and more on systems where nobody's in charge; the intelligence is simply 'emergent,' which is to say that it appears to arise spontaneously from the number-crunching.  These probabilistic systems aren't perfect, but they are statistically optimized to excel over time and large numbers.  They're designed to 'scale,' or to improve with size.  And a little slop at the microscale is the price of efficiency at the macroscale." (Anderson 68)

"Why does anyone create something of value (from an encyclopedia entry to an astronomical observation) without a business plan or even the prospect of a paycheck?  The question is a key one to understanding the Long Tail, partly because so much of what populates the curve does not start with commercial aim.  More important, this question matters because it represents yet another example of where our presumptions about markets must be rethought.  The motives to create are not the same in the head as they are in the tail." (Anderson 73)

"The reason one might call it an economy at all is that there is a coin of the realm that can be every bit as motivating as money: *reputation*." (Anderson 74)

"In 2004, 950,000 books out of the 1.2 million tracked by Nielsen BookScan sold fewer than ninety-nine copies.  Another 200,000 sold fewer than 1,000 copies.  Only 25,000 sold more than 5,000 copies.  The average book in America sells about 500 copies.  In other words, about 98 percent of books are noncommercial, whether they were intended that way or not." (Anderson 76)

"Such profitless publishing can be lucrative all the same.  the book becomes not the product of value but the *advertisement* for the product of value -- the authors themselves.  Many such noncommercial books are best seen as marketing vehicles meant to enhance the academic reputation of their authors, market their consultancy, earn them speaking fees, or just leave their mark on the world.  Seen that way, self-publishing is not a way to make money; it's a way to distribute your message." (Anderson 76)

"Of course, Amazon didn't invent the notion of print-on-demand.  It has long been a dream of the book industry, but until recently, print-on-demand was hobbled by technical and economic constraints." (Anderson 95)

"Despite the compelling economics, the publishing industry is still far from a widespread shift to print-on-demand.  Traditional printing is considerably cheaper for large batches.... Then there is the gnarly question of rights.  For older books, the author's permission is required to make a book available as a print-on-demand edition.  Yet many authors are afraid that the price premium now required of on-demand printing (a few dollars to cover the slightly higher production costs compared to bulk printing) will suppress sales; so they resist. 
"But the potential of print-on-demand is extraordinary, and not just for the onesies and twosies.  The biggest cost to publishers is the cost of returns from booksellers, which the publishers freely accept as a matter of industry practice.  The reason booksellers over-order is that they want to make sure they don't run out between print runs, and since the cost of any excess is borne by the publisher, there's little risk in ordering a bit more than they might need.  But if the booksellers knew that demand could be filled via small print-on-demand batches between big print runs, they might be willing to order no more than they actually need, potentially reducing returns radically." (Anderson 95-96)

"The catch-all phrase for recommendations and all the other tools that help you find quality in the Long Tail is *filters*.  These technologies and services sift through a vast array of choices to present you with the ones that are most right for you." (Anderson 108)

"In today's Long Tail markets, the main effect of filters is to help people move from the world they know ('hits') to the world they don't ('niches') via a route that is both comfortable and tailored to their tastes." (Anderson 109)

multiple kinds of filters:  categories or "multi-level taxonomy" (110); bestseller lists; pattern matching; editor recommendations and editorial reviews; collaborative filtering (listeners who liked x also liked y)

"These are the failures of one-size-fits-all aggregation and filtering.  iTunes may be working its way down the Tail, but its emphasis on simplicity -- and lowest-common-denominator metadata -- forces it into a standard presentational model that can't cater effectively to every genre -- and therefore, every consumer." (Anderson 112)

"you have to treat niches as niches.  When you look at a widely diverse three-dimensional marketplace through a one-dimensional lens, you get nonsense." (Anderson 114)

"Why are filters so important to a functioning Long Tail?  Because without them, the Long Tail risks just being noise." (Anderson 115)

"Inventory is 'non-rivalrous' on the Web and the ratio of good to bad is simply a signal-to-noise problem, solvable with information tools." (Anderson 117)

"in Long Tail markets, the role of filter then shifts from gatekeeper to advisor." (Anderson 123)

"Of course, just as pre-filters aren't perfect -- e.g., the talent scouts don't always pick artists that sell records -- the same is true of post-filters.  Because post-filters tend to be amateurs, oftentimes that means less critical independence and more random malice.  Moreover, the problem with post-filtering is that feedback comes *after* publication, not before.  As a result, errors that would have been caught by editors and other wise eyes can sneak through, and even though the collective post-filter feedback can eventually correct them, they may never disappear entirely." (Anderson 124)

"an apparent paradox of the Long Tail.  The characteristic steep falloff shape of a popularity powerlaw comes from the effect of powerful word-of-mouth feedback loops that amplify consumer preference, making the reputation-rich even richer and the reputation-poor relatively poorer.  Success breeds success.  In network theory such positive feedback loops tend to create winner-take-all phenomena, which is another way of saying that they're awesome hit-making machines. 
"Compounding matters, today's filters make word-of-mouth even more powerful by measuring so many more products.  Shouldn't that then have the effect of making the powerlaw even steeper, *increasing* the gap between hits and niches rather than having a leveling effect? 
"In other words, why don't network-effect recommendation systems, which are essential in driving demand down the Tail, actually do the opposite: drive content *up* the Tail, further amplifying hit/niche inequality?... 
"The explanation, as it turns out, is that these filters and other recommendation systems actually work most strongly at the niche level, within a genre and subgenre." (Anderson 140-41)

Anderson's explanation of why MySpace has worked as a promoter of free independent music in a way that MP3.com didn't:  "The answer at this point appears to be that it is a very effective combination of community and content.  The strong social ties between the tens of millions of fans there help guide them to obscure music that they wouldn't otherwise find, while the content gives them a reason to keep visiting." (Anderson 149)

"If professional affiliation is no longer a proxy for authority, we need to develop our own gauges of quality.  This encourages us to think for ourselves.  Wikipedia is a starting point for exploring a topic, not the last word." (Anderson 191)
