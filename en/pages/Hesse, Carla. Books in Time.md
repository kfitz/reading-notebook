1.  Introduction: The Medium is not the mode

"What can the history of the book tell us about its future?  What must we understand about the cultural and historical roles of traditional literary institutions -- such as, the author, the book, publishing, and the public -- in order to design the systems and institutions that will mediate the uses of new electronic technologies?" (Hesse 21)

"despite the technocratic bias of much of this research, the historical record makes unquestionably clear that the most distinctive features of what we have come to refer to as 'print culture' -- that is, the stabilization of written culture into a canon of authored texts, the notion of the author as creator, the book as property, and the reader as an elective public -- *were not* inevitable historical consequences of the invention of printing during the Renaissance, but, rather, the cumulative result of particular social and political choices made by given societies at given moments." (Hesse 21)

term "print culture" is "misleading in that it implicitly carries with it a technological determinism that conflates the history of a *means of cultural production* (the printing press) with the historical development of a *mode of cultural production* which Roger Chartier has called 'le circuit du livre' and that I would render in English as 'the civilization of the book,' or better still, for reasons I hope soon to make clear 'the modern literary system.'" (Hesse 21)

2.  A brief genealogy of the modern literary system

printed book as an "expression of a cultural ideal... crystallized into what I would call the 'modern literary system' with the advent of the modern western democracies at the end of the eighteenth century." (Hesse 22)

"There is no evidence of any clear link between the advent of printing and the emergence of the notion of the individual author as the source of knowledge or truths.  This idea seems much more clearly linked, rather, to the changing political, institutional, and cultural demands of the Renaissance states and their absolutist successors, which developed the need for new sets of skills and a new notion of individual accountability." (Hesse 22)

"It was only slowly, over the course of the eighteenth century, and in a highly limited manner, that the author became legally recognized as the originator of his or her works (in England in 1710; in France in 1793; and in Prussia in 1794)." (Hesse 22)

"It may thus be concluded that the authored and owned book is an expression of a cultural ideal which the modern West has cherished but which has had very little to do with the technology that has produced it.... In fact, one of the most striking facts to the historian of the book is how closely the current discussion of the future of the book in the electronic age resonates with debates among the eighteenth-century Enlightenment *philosophes* and their revolutionary heirs." (Hesse 23)

on John Locke: "Books must be seen merely as a mechanism of transmission, a fulcrum between sender and receiver, rather than as a repository or container of fixed truths." (Hesse 23)

on Condorcet: "the notion of authorship itself was an archaic creation of the absolutist monarchy, bent on dispensing privileged commercial and honorific monopolies to favored subjects rather than on facilitating the spread of light." (Hesse 23)

"To fix knowledge between two cardboard covers, and to attribute ownership to someone was to constrain its circulation. The best way to spread knowledge, according to Condorcet, was through authorless and opened-ended [sic] texts, circulating freely between all citizens: he imagined the periodical press supported through the mechanism of subscription rather than through the institution of royalties to authors or monopolies to publishers.  Indeed, what Condorcet conceived of as an ideally transparent mode of exchange through the deregulation of print publishing looks a lot like a mechanical version of the Internet." (Hesse 23-24)

resemblances between internet and periodical press of 18th c. includes "the reassertion of the editorial over the authorial voice" (Hesse 24)

Condorcet's experiment was abandoned not because of "the technological limits of mechanical printing" but rather "because of the political terror they experienced as cultural forces were unleashed with this new textuality after the French Revolution of 1789." (Hesse 24)

"By 1793, anyone could own a printing press or engage in publishing and bookselling.  What is more, with the abolition of royal literary privileges and the end to prepublication censorship, it appeared that anyone could print or publish anything.  Thus, the first few years of the French Revolution saw the corporatist literary system of the old regime entirely dismantled and replaced by a free market in the world of ideas. // These changes did not, however, inaugurate the kind of cultural life their authors had envisions.  Cultural anarchy ensued in the wake of the 'declaration of the freedom of the press'." (Hesse 25)

"without any commercial protection of the author or publisher, book publishing became economically unfeasible." (Hesse 25)

chaos led Condorcet to "play a leading role in initiating legislation in 1793 to restore a cultural order centered in the 'civilization of the book,' by legally recognizing the principle of literary property as a means of holding individual authors accountable for what they published and by reregulating print commerce to make book publishing, as opposed to ephemeral printed matter, again commercially viable." (Hesse 25)

"Through the legal notion of a 'limited property right,' the National convention reshaped the political and legal identity of the author, transforming that cultural agent form a privileged creature of the absolutist state into a property-owning civic hero, an agent of public enlightenment." (Hesse 25-26)

"These legal and institution changes aimed at ensuring the dominance of the book -- a cultural form that encouraged slow, reasoned reflection upon events, rather than the spontaneous and rapid interventions made possible by newspaper and pamphlet production." (Hesse 26)

"for the last several centuries the lion's share of profits in commercial publishing has inhered not in the limited 'property right' claims to an author's text, but rather in the claim to a particular edition of the text or, as Gérard Genette has called it, the 'paratext' (format, notes, introduction, illustrations, etc.)." (Hesse 26)

"Like Condorcet in 1792, we seem to be facing the anxieties that attend the possibility of losing the means of associating a particular work or text with an individual agency, or of losing the writer's and even the reader's individuality; the possibility of a disappearance, perhaps, of the Enlightenment sense of self and of a sociability based upon a Rousseauesque model of intellectual community and of a liberal model of public life rooted in individualism and private property.  These cultural institutions, I hope I have demonstrated, were not consequences of printing, but rather of sociopolitical choices, embodied in legal and institutional policies that ensured the realization of that cultural ideal." (Hesse 27-28)

"The *modern* literary system, the 'modernized civilization of the book,' that emerged from the democratic revolutions of the eighteenth century represents a particular vision of cultural life which embodies the ideals of the autonomous, self-creating and self-governing, property-owning individual, universal access to knowledge, and the assurance of cautious public reflection and debate.  What we must determine, then, in the remaking of the literary system in the electronic age, in our choice to either challenge or affirm those ideals through the legal, political, economic, and institutional policies we implement, is what kind of cultural agents we envision for the future: put somewhat tendentiously, are we to sustain self-constituting and accountable citizens of a democracy or are we going to advance the future of continuously and spontaneously recomposing postmodernist subjectivities, inhabiting an increasingly imaginable, technocratically managed empire?" (Hesse 28)

3.  The remaking of the literary system in the electronic age

"The striking parallels between the late eighteenth and late twentieth centuries' cultural debates suggest to me that what we are witnessing in the remaking of the 'modern literary system' at the end of the twentieth century is not so much a technological revolution (which has already occurred) but the public reinvention of intellectual community in its wake." (Hesse 29)

"Most striking to the historian, in witnessing the remaking of the literary system in the present age, is the almost unwitting impulse to reconceptualize the key institutions of modern literary culture -- the book, the author, the reader, and the library in terms of time, motion, and modes of action, rather than in terms of space, objects, and actors." (Hesse 30)

"What appears to be emerging form the digital revolution is the possibility of a new mode of temporality for public communication, one in which public exchange through the written word can occur without deferral, in a continuously immediate present.  A world in which we are all, through electronic writing, continuously present to one another.  There is, I would like to suggest, something unprecedented in this possibility of the escape of writing from fixity.  What the digitalization of text seems to have opened up is the possibility for writing to operate in a temporal mode hitherto exclusively possible for speech, as *parole* rather than *langue*." (Hesse 32)
