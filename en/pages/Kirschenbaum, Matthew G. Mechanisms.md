on Agrippa:  "Was the text's illicit dissemination online the point of the project from the very start, or did Gibson and the others originally imagine it as an irrevocably vanishing performance piece about the ephemeral nature of memory and media?" (Kirschenbaum x)

"What *is* certain is that in Gibson's 'Agrippa' we have an electronic text that is volatile and ephemeral *by design*, which nonetheless turns out to be one of the most persistent and available literary artifacts on the Web." (Kirschenbaum x)

"Thus the cold truth of modern data storage: given sufficient resources -- that is, elite technical and financial backing -- data can be recovered from media even under the most extraordinary conditions." (Kirschenbaum xii)

"our current theories and points of reference for reckoning with electronic textuality were inadequate when parsed against what I had come to understand as the material matrix governing writing and inscription in all forms: erasure, variability, repeatability, and survivability.  _Mechanisms_ is therefore a book about the textual and technical primitives of electronic writing and (by extension) other types of data recorded in electronic media." (Kirschenbaum xii-xiii)

"new histories of inscription being written by such diverse critics as Friedrich Kittler, Lisa Gitelman, Bruce Clarke, Bruno Latour, Timothy Lenoir, Patricia Crain, and Adrian Johns." (Kirschenbaum xiii)

"A mechanism is both a product and a process" (Kirschenbaum xiv)


Introduction: "Awareness of the Mechanism"

"The nanoscale is now the venue for exotic writing techniques fusing inscription and fabrication." (Kirschenbaum 2)

"Electronic textuality is similarly locatable, even though we are not accustomed to thinking of it in physical terms.  Bits can be measured in microns when recorded on a magnetic hard disk." (Kirschenbaum 3)

"In an essay on digital preservation, Kenneth Thibodeau, Director of Electronic Records Programs at the National Archives and Records Administration, offers a tripartite model for defining digital objects:  first, as *physical* objects ('signs inscribed on a medium' -- for example, the flux reversals recorded on magnetic tape); second, as *logical* objects (data as it is recognized and interpreted by particular processes and applications software; for example, the binary composition of a Word .DOC file); and third, as *conceptual* objects ('the object we deal with in the real world,' such as a digital photograph as it appears prima facie on the screen)." (Kirschenbaum 3)

"'In order to preserve a digital object,' [Thibodeau] writes, 'we must be able to identify and retrieve all its digital components." (Kirschenbaum 4)

"My reading of the critical literature on new media suggests that the field has focused primarily on the third of Thibodeau's three levels, the conceptual -- that is, the phenomenological manifestation of the application or digital event on the screen -- and only somewhat more recently, in the wake of mature formalist studies like Espen Aarseth's _Cybertext_ and Lev Manovich's _Language of New Media_ (both very different in their own right), on the interaction between the logical and conceptual layers.  However much of my attention (especially in the first half of the book) will fall on storage, a category routinely elided in the critical discussion, presumably because the uses to which electronic data is put are seen as wholly independent of any particular mode of physical record." (Kirschenbaum 4)

"Computers themselves were initially engines of prediction and prognostication (where will an aircraft be in the sky such that a shell can be fired to intercept it), not recollection and storage; they only became so with the advent of the so-called von Neumann model and the somewhat later addition of random access to large reserves of information." (Kirschenbaum 4-5)

"Crucially, storage today is both an accessory, something you hold in your hand or slip into your pocket (your iPod or memory stick), but is also increasingly disembodied and dematerialized as we approach terabyte-scale disks where users are no longer constrained in their information retention by the capacity of their hard drives." (Kirschenbaum 5)

"Kittler offers up a narrative of media convergence in which the original storage monopoly of alphabetic writing is now reinscribed as the universal ones and zeros of digital computation.  This is a narrative that I find deeply unsatisfying... Kittler's attention nowadays has turned to chips and circuits, not to the contemporary storage devices that are the true heirs to his trinity of gramophone, film, and typewriter." (Kirschenbaum 6)

"even the modest temporal distance serves to defamiliarize certain key cultural aspects of computing; for example, storage technologies and disk handling practices differ markedly from what is the norm today" (Kirschenbaum 8)

"we will also consider the ways in which user habits and activities change as storage media grow more capacious.  The simple practice of creating subdirectories, for example, is relatively rare with file systems stored on floppies but commonplace, indeed essential, with hard drives." (Kirschenbaum 8)

"a distinction between what I term forensic materiality and formal materiality... In brief: forensic materiality rests upon the principle of individualization (basic to modern forensic science and criminalistics), the idea that now two things in the physical world are ever exactly alike." (Kirschenbaum 10)

"Bits are -- in other words -- *symbols* to be set and reset, set and resent, on again and off again, over and over again.  Whereas forensic materiality rests upon the potential for individualization inherent in matter, a digital environment is an abstract projection supported and sustained by its capacity to propagate the illusion (or call it a working model) of *immaterial* behavior: identification without ambiguity, transmission without loss, repetition without originality." (Kirschenbaum 11)

"computers are not flawless.  Errors typically occur at the juncture between analog and digital states, such as when a drive's magnetoresistive head assigns binary symbolic value to the voltage differentials it has registered, or when an e-mail message is reconstituted from independent data packets moving across the TCP/IP layer of the Internet, itself dependent on fiber-optic cables and other hardwired technologies." (Kirschenbaum 12)

"Formal materiality is not an absolute term, but rather one that tries to capture something of the procedural friction or perceived difference -- the torque -- as a user shifts from one set of software logics to another." (Kirschenbaum 13)

"While it may seem tempting to associate forensic and formal materiality with hardware and software respectively, those associations should not be granted without question, not least because the lines between hardware and software are themselves increasingly blurred, as is manifest in so-called firmware, or programmable hardware, a contradiction in terms that literalizes the conceit of formal materiality at the very level of the chip." (Kirschenbaum 13)

"Software's emergence as an industry commodity must be part of any calculus of its formal materiality, and this complicates any easy association with exclusively formal processes." (Kirschenbaum 14)

"Forensic and formal materiality are perhaps better brought to rest on the twin textual and technological bases of inscription (storage) and transmission (or multiplication)... Forensic and formal materiality also accord with the fundamental duality of a mechanism as both a product and a process." (Kirschenbaum 15)

"textual studies should be recognized as among the most sophisticated branches of media studies we have evolved.... But though recent years have seen a tremendous acceleration of interest (and much practical progress) in methods of electronic editing, there has been very little consideration of digital media themselves from the specific vantage points of bibliography and textual criticism.  Rather, textual critics have tended to treat the computer mainly as a platform-independent venue for studying the artifacts of *other* media." (Kirschenbaum 16)

"the practical concerns of digital preservation can function as vehicle for critical inquiry into the nature of new media and electronic textuality" (Kirschenbaum 18)

"Chapter 1 delineates the screen essentialism and accompanying medial ideology that the book argues has pervaded much of the critical and theoretical writing about electronic textuality to date, and it attempts to bring storage in the tradition of von Neumann computing (the most significant computational tradition of the twentieth century), where data takes the form of marks and physical inscriptions, to bear as a counterweight." (Kirschenbaum 19)

"A forensic perspective furnishes us with two key concepts for an alternative approach to electronic textual studies: trace evidence and individualization." (Kirschenbaum 19)

"The hard drive serves as the book's central example of what it means to consider storage media as a kind of writing machine.... I offer a detailed grammatology of the hard drive based on a technical and theoretical examination of the drive's basic operations -- what I call a 'machine reading,' which takes an instrument or device rather than a text as its locus." (Kirschenbaum 19)

"a detailed version history of _Afternoon_ itself in the service of a larger argument about the diachronic dimensions of electronic textuality.... The chapter suggests a scene of electronic textuality that is a hybrid of printed and electronic components, all of which are relevant to the project of versioning and all of which form their own contours amid the newly institutionalized spaces that are now the repository for Joyce's work as its versions are cataloged and accessioned for posterity... a consideration of digital document practices that exploit the medium's capacity to capture the temporal and diachronic dimensions of writing and revision." (Kirschenbaum 20)

"The point is to address the fundamentally social, rather than the solely technical mechanisms of electronic textual transmission, and the role of social networks and network culture as active agents of preservation." (Kirschenbaum 21)

"As electronic objects begin to accumulate archival identities (by virtue of the libraries, museums, and other cultural repositories increasingly interested in or charged with collecting them), it will become essential to understand the nature of what is being collected and preserved, and where the most significant challenges of digital preservation finally lie.  One underlying theme of this book is that those challenges, while massively technical to be sure, are also ultimately -- and profoundly -- social.  That is, this book aims to show that effective preservation must rest in large measure on the cultivation of new social practices to attend our new media." (Kirschenbaum 21)

"I conclude that new media cannot be studied apart from individual instances of inscription, object, and code as they propagate on, across, and through specific storage devices, operating systems, software environments, and network protocols; yet the forensic imagination of the book's subtitle is also conceived as a deeply humanistic way of knowing, one that assigns value to time, history, and social or material circumstance -- even trauma and wear -- as part of our thinking about new media." (Kirschenbaum 23)


1.  "Every Contact Leaves a Trace": Storage, Inscription, and Computer Forensics

"remanence -- defined by an influential National Computer Security Center study as 'the residual physical representation of data that has been in some way erased'" (Kirschenbaum 26)

"Taken together, the academy and the DoD reveal two starkly different attitudes toward the textual condition of electronic objects circa 1991 (one year prior to the production of _Agrippa_) and ask us to develop an approach capable of accounting for the ways in which electronic data was simultaneously perceived as evanescent and ephemeral in some quarters, and remarkably, stubbornly, perniciously stable and persistent in others." (Kirschenbaum 27)

"there is no computation without data's representation in a corresponding physical substratum, the specifics of which very quickly get us into a messy world of matter and metal" (Kirschenbaum 27)

"The history of codes reveals a continuum rather than an absolute rupture between human and machine reading." (Kirschenbaum 30)

"Nick Montfort has coined the term 'screen essentialism' to refer to the prevailing bias in new media studies toward display technologies that would have been unknown to most computer users before the mid-1970s" (Kirschenbaum 31)

"Attention to the affordances of various kinds of storage media can reveal much about computing in different contexts, allowing us to reconstruct salient aspects of now-obsolete systems and the human practices that attended them." (Kirschenbaum 32)

"the current state of new media studies in which the graphical user interface is often uncritically accepted as the ground zero of the user's experience." (Kirschenbaum 34)

"I believe electronic textual theory has labored under similar uncritical absorptions of the medium's self- or seemingly self-evident representations.  While often precisely Romantic in their celebration of the fragile half-life of the digital, the 'ideology' I want to delineate below is perhaps better thought of as *medial* -- that is, one that substitutes popular representations of a medium, socially constructed and culturally activated to perform specific kinds of work, for a more comprehensive treatment of the material particulars of a given technology." (Kirschenbaum 36)

"At stake is not whether such conventions for representing digital phenomena are accurate or correct to the formal ontology of information in an absolute sense, but rather the important fact that Western consumer culture had succeeded in evolving sophisticated and compelling conceits for depicting information as an essence unto itself, or more properly, information as a synthetic (at times even haptic) commodity." (Kirschenbaum 38)

"Cyberspace, as it is invoked here, can only be a technology in the sense that the word itself -- or more precisely, the idea of cyberspace -- mimics the behavior of certain material technologies, functioning as a 'powerful, collective, mnemonic' -- or in other words, as a shorthand for a whole range of communicative agendas given depth and form by a shared aesthetic." (Kirschenbaum 39)

"At the core of a medial ideology of electronic text is the notion that in place of inscription, mechanism, sweat of the brow (or its mechanical equivalent steam), and cramp of the hand, there is light, reason, and energy unleashed in the electric empyrean." (Kirschenbaum 39)

"Indeed, what was *new* about the technology was precisely that it succeeded so completely in rendering the workaday labor of textual production *functionally* immaterial." (Kirschenbaum 40)

"Electronic writing thus becomes a friction-free 'information flow,' an essentially symbolic rather than inscriptive exchange among a set of operational metaphors and the 'electronic elements' on the screen." (Kirschenbaum 41, quoting Michael Heim)

"I believe that the close temporal proximity and occasional outright overlap in the passages I have been collecting point not to a transparent and self-sufficient account of the ontology of the medium itself, but rather to the emerging contours of a media ideology." (Kirschenbaum 43)

"Screen essentialism becomes a logical consequence of a medial ideology that shuns the inscriptive act." (Kirschenbaum 43)

"For the theoretical observer, it is bracing to watch the forensic investigator run up against many of the same issues that have driven commentators in the realm of cultural and critical theory.  While digital evidence can be instantly deleted it can often be just as easily recovered; while digital evidence can be copied perfectly (what we like to call a simulacrum), it can also be copied imperfectly, and in fact care must be taken lest it be copied incompletely; while digital evidence can be tampered with, it can also be stabilized and encrypted; while digital evidence can be faked, it can also be signed and algorithmically authenticated." (Kirschenbaum 45)

"'Every contact leaves a trace.' This is more, not less, true in the delicate reaches of computer systems." (Kirschenbaum 49)

"the uniquely indelible nature of magnetic storage, or the uncompromising pronouncements of computer privacy experts like Michael Colonyiddes: 'Electronic mail and computer records are far more permanent than any piece of paper'" (Kirschenbaum 51)

"'ambient data', the term emphasizing the way in which records accumulate on a file system absent the intervention of any single, conscious (human) agency." (Kirschenbaum 51)

"There is, in short, no simple way to know how many instances of a single file are residing in how many states, in how many different locations, at any given moment in the operating system." (Kirschenbaum 52)

"The preceding should make clear the extent to which a lay user's view of a file system -- accessed only through standard directory structures or a Fund funtion, or with the aid of menus, and manipulated using commands like Copy, Rename, and Remove -- is optimized and impoverished, a partial and simplistic window onto the diverse electronic records that have accumulated on the surface of the magnetic disk... an investigator will want to create a so-called bitstream image of the original file system.  A bitstream is exactly that: every bit recorded on some original, physical instance of storage media is transferred in linear sequence to the copied image, whether it is part of a file currently allocated in the FAT or not." (Kirschenbaum 53)

"While bitstream drive imaging and its legal status as documentary evidence would seem to reinforce the familiar postmodern argument about the digital simulacrum -- copies without an original -- it in fact underscores the heterogeneity of digital reproduction." (Kirschenbaum 53-54)

"there is nothing essentially fluid about data in an electronic environment, and there are important areas in which the stability and verifiability of electronic documents is essential, ranging from secure e-commerce to security and defense." (Kirschenbaum 56)

"questions of authenticity are directly related to an electronic object's ability to not only resist but also to expose tampering." (Kirschenbaum 57)

"electronic document security -- situated at the intersection of encryption, computer security, e-commerce, digital rights management, and digital archives and records management -- can only underscore the limited and arbitrary nature of any medial ideology that celebrates only the fluidity and fungibility of electronic text." (Kirschenbaum 58)

"Contrary to popular belief, initializing a disk does *not* erase or overwrite all of its data; it only erases the FAT and resets the basic formatting information.  Actual data remains on the disk, and can be recovered using well-known techniques." (Kirschenbaum 59)

"while bits are the smallest symbolic units of computation, they are not the smallest inscribed unit, a disjunction that underscores the need to distinguish between the forensic and the formal in discussions of computational materiality." (Kirschenbaum 61)

"magnetic inscription is a temporal as well as a planographic intervention, whereby even data that has been overwritten continues to resonate as a result of the ongoing oscillation of the magnetic field." (Kirschenbaum 66)

"the ether into which digital objects are often said to vanish is a historically constructed and contested site, with a rich tradition of visualization and imaging/imagining that erupted in the late nineteenth century." (Kirschenbaum 66)

"Nowadays we toggle the CTRL-D and CTRL-Z shortcuts, deleting content and undoing the act at a whim.  Gone and then back again, the keyboard-chorded Fort and Da of contemporary knowledge work." (Kirschenbaum 69)

"The point is one that will be familiar to any student of writing technologies: writing practices engender an eruption of tools and techniques to fix, expunge, and recover their meaning-bearing marks and traces." (Kirschenbaum 71)


2.  Extreme Inscription: A Grammatology of the Hard Drive

"The hard drive, and magnetic media more generally, are mechanisms of *extreme* inscription -- that is, they offer a limit case for how the inscriptive act can be imagined and executed." (Kirschenbaum 74)

"That the physical seclusion of the hard drive renders it an almost literal black box should not be underestimated as a reason it has gone unremarked upon in discussions of electronic textuality to date." (Kirschenbaum 75)

"computers could not have expanded from their role as wartime calculators to new media databases without the introduction of a nonvolatile, large-volume, inexpensive technology affording operators near-instantaneous and simultaneous access to all stored records." (Kirschenbaum 77-78)

"Statistically, electronic textuality is almost always automated textuality -- which is to say that most of the textual events in a modern operating system, or network, occur without the impetus of a human agency.  The kind of intentional writing we routinely do with a word processor of a text editor is actually responsible for only a small fraction of the electronic textual output of modern computing systems." (Kirschenbaum 83)

"A little over two decades later, DOS, the Disk Operating System, would arise precisely because of the need to displace the process of reading and writing data to and from the floppy or other magnetic media.  The essential function of the operating system that thus paved the way for personal computing was to remove the inscriptive act form the direct oversight of the human user, screening it first by the command line and then by a graphical user interface.  Read and Write (or later Save) became words to be typed or menu items to be selected rather than actions to be manually performed." (Kirschenbaum 84)

"Digital inscription is a form of displacement.  Its fundamental characteristic is to remove digital objects from the channels of direct human intervention." (Kirschenbaum 86)

"We write *on* paper, but we write *to* a magnetic disk (or tape).... The preposition is a legacy of the von Neumann model, where storage is a physically as well as logically distinct portion of the computer.  Writing data 'to' the storage element thus entails a literal as well as a logical displacement." (Kirschenbaum 87)

"Here I propose a close reading, a reading both close to and of a piece with a machine -- a *machine reading* whose object is not text but a mechanism or device.  What then are its essential characteristics -- its grammatology -- as an inscription technology?
Here is my list:  it is *random access*; it is a *signal processor*; it is *differential* (and *chronographic*); it is *volumetric*; it is *rationalized* (and *atomized*); it is *motion-dependent*; it is *planographic*; and it is *nonvolatile* (but also *variable*)." (Kirschenbaum 88-89)

"hard drives permit (essentially) instantaneous access to any portion of the physical media without the need to fast-forward or rewind a sequence." (Kirschenbaum 89)

"The conventional wisdom is that what gets written to a hard disk is a simple magnetic expression of a bit: a one or a zero, aligned as a north or south polarity.  In fact, the process is a highly condensed and complex set of symbolic transformations by which a 'bit,' as a binary value in the computer's memory, is converted to a voltage that is passed through the drive's read/write head where the current creates an electromagnetic field reversing the polarity of not one but several individual magnetic dipoles -- a whole pattern of flux reversals -- embedded in the material substrate of the disk." (Kirschenbaum 89)

"The relevant points are that writing and reading to and from disk are ultimately a form of digital to analog or analog to digital signal processing -- not unlike the function of a modem -- and that the data contained on the disk is a second-order representation of the actual digital values the data assumes for computation." (Kirschenbaum 90)

"The read/write head measures reversals between magnetic fields rather than the actual charge of an individual magnetic dipole.  In other words, it is a differential device -- signification depends upon a change in the value of the signal being received rather than the substance of the signal itself. (Readers may recognize similarities to the classic Saussurian model of differential relations in linguistics.)" (Kirschenbaum 90)

on codex as random-access device, see Masten, Stallybrass, and Vickers in introduction to _Language Machines: Technologies of Literary and Cultural Production_

"Unlike other forms of magnetic media such as video or audio tape, or even floppy disks, where the read/write heads physically touch the surface of the recording medium, the head of a hard disk drive 'flies' above the platter at a distance that is a tiny fraction of the width of a human hair." (Kirschenbaum 95)

"John Guillory observes that 'information' (undoubtedly the transcendental signifier of our age) is functionally defined by its capacity for both storage and transmission, and that these two qualities are codependent precisely and paradoxically because they are mutually exclusive" (Kirschenbaum 96)

"Storage, then, is a kind of suspended animation, a coma or waking death, oddly inert yet irreducibly physically present; hence its association with the uncanny, the unconscious, the dead." (Kirschenbaum 97)

"Obsessive-compulsive printing and filing of e-mail and other electronic ephemera is a phenomenon born of easy access to affordable desktop printing services (the networked laser as a ubiquitous feature of the corporate IT environment), coupled with deep-seated suspicion and unease about the reliability of long-term electronic data storage." (Kirschenbaum 97)

"As Derrida notes in _Archive Fever_, 'what is no longer archived in the same way is no longer lived in the same way.'" (Kirschenbaum 101)

"This impulse toward equating subjective identity with personal data stores is emerging as one of the most dramatic features of contemporary discourse networks.  'You are your C,' proclaims the title of a net art project by Carlo Zanni dedicated to 'electronic soul mirroring.'" (Kirschenbaum 102)

"It is tempting to continue in this posthuman vein: the double helix as the ultimate data structure.  Yet there is also something that seems almost willfully naive about Bell's claims and ambitions -- are we really to accept we are simply the sum total of all the media we produce and consume?" (Kirschenbaum 104)

"The question, in other words, is not whether we will have the storage capacity to accumulate copies of every book, film, song, conversation, e-mail, etc. that we amass in a lifetime (yes, eventually) but how do these accumulations, these massive drifts of data, interact with irreducible levels of lived experience?" (Kirschenbaum 105)

"The work depends *not* on the simple equation of life with data, but on the proposition that *if* you were equated with your data, this what (and who) you would be." (Kirschenbaum 105)

"All media are bound to the materialities of their particular forms, materialities that materialize in the shape of intellectual property, incompatible standards (ask anyone who has ever tried to navigate the treacherous shoals of region-specific DVD codes), obsolescence, IPOs, sell-outs, buy-outs, and so on." (Kirschenbaum 106)

"The lesson here is that the same channels of optical fiber networks that flatten media down to a universal symbolic regimen can also be employed to leverage that same regiment o write out or write-protect any data stream encoded to operate within it." (Kirschenbaum 106)

"the hard drive is not so much confronted with obsolescence as it is with further displacement, no longer even residing in the same physical machine the user lays hands on." (Kirschenbaum 107)

"the psychological impact of saving data inside the machine, rather than to some external locale, cannot be overlooked.  I believe that it is, in its own way, as significant as the advent of the GUI, the more commonly celebrated revolution of that era." (Kirschenbaum 109)


3.  "An Old House with Many Rooms": The Textual Forensics of Mystery\_House.dsk

"where is this hermeneutic cycle -- this capacity for 'archival materials and bibliographic analysis to fund a larger critical and interpretative program' -- to be found in new digital media? Can theory or criticism of born-digital objects benefit from attention to the minute particulars of archival data, and if so, in what do those details consist?" (Kirschenbaum 114)

"The complement to forensic materiality as I have been defining it, formal materiality is the term I use to capture the multiple behaviors and states of digital objects and the relational attitudes by which some are naturalized as a result of the procedural friction, or torque (as I called it in the introduction), imposed by different software environments." (Kirschenbaum 132-33)

"allographic objects, such as written texts, *fulfill* their ontology in reproduction, while autographic objects, such as a painting, *betray* their ontology in reproduction." (Kirschenbaum 133)

"My argument, then, is this: computers are unique in the history of writing technologies in that they present a premeditated material environment built and engineered to propagate an illusion of immateriality; the digital nature of computational representation is precisely what enables this illusion -- or else call it a working model -- of immaterial behavior." (Kirschenbaum 135)

"The computer's formal environment is therefore a *built* environment, manufactured and machined, and it has as its most basic property the recursive ability to mimic or recapitulate the behaviors of other formal environments." (Kirschenbaum 137)

"The cascade is the process of abstracting inscriptions, via consolidation or tabulation or redaction.... The cascade is also, I would argue, the process of siting an inscription in an allographic modality, such that it becomes available for procedural manipulation and formal abstraction." (Kirschenbaum 139)

"Information becomes more volatile (and more usable or available) as it becomes more abstract because it is more susceptible to the basic operators of allographic manipulation, deftly pinpointed by Kari M. Kraus as substitution, deletion, insertion, transposition, relocation, and repetition." (Kirschenbaum 140)

"What we see, then, is an inverse relation between the autographic but illegible signatures of actual computational inscription -- the individualized trace of a bit representation as instrumented, say, by magnetic force microscopy -- and the computational power that follows from its allographic manipulation in a digital -- discrete -- format." (Kirschenbaum 141)

"At some point then in the inscriptive cascade, information routinely slips from a formal to a forensic materiality and back again.  Where exactly does this slippage occur?  The answer must be media-specific to individual hardware and software configurations, individual technologies of storage and inscription." (Kirschenbaum 141)

on markup: see "A Gentle Introduction to SGML," http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/tei-tocs?div=DIV1&id=SG , from teh TEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange; see also McGann, Radiant Textuality

"The student of formal materiality will immediately note the fact that markup's fundamental quality is that it models text with more text." (Kirschenbaum 154)

"Emulators themselves are textbook examples of formal materiality, relying as they do on cascades of virtual machinery to reproduce the functionality of long-gone systems and hardware, the physical limitations of mothballed chips reinstantiated in formally construed mechanisms of control and constraint." (Kirschenbaum 155)

"Ultimately I want to resist the notion that forensics gets us deeper into the computer, lower down to the essence, closer to the soul of the machine.  First and not least, computer forensics is carried out *with computers*, so there is a kind of Heisenberg principle at work." (Kirschenbaum 157)

"the bibliographer and textual critic of the future may well need to know as much about hex editors, hashes, and magnetic force microscopy as he or she now knows about collation formula, paleography, and stemma." (Kirschenbaum 158)


4.  Save As:  Michael Joyce's _Afternoons_

"My objective is not just to put the relevant bibliographical history on record, but to consider what electronic textual artifacts have to tell us about the nature of textual transmission writ large, and conversely what textual studies has to teach about the textual condition of electronic objects." (Kirschenbaum 164)

"_Afternoon_ thus walks a fine line: though it depends on the reader's active engagement, that engagement is achieved by way of exquisite control -- or craft -- by the author.... Jane Yellowlees Douglas introduces the term 'intensional network' to caputer the manner by which a reader's interaction with a hypertext is, seemingly paradoxically, contingent upon strong authorial intent" (Kirschenbaum 165)

"The point, then, is that Storyspace has significant grounding in a hierarchical data model that is absent from, or at times (as we see with Ryan above) presented as overtly antithetical to, the rhizomatic networks of postmodern hypertext theory." (Kirschenbaum 173)

"In retrospect, we can see that Storyspace emerged out of a thick tissue of influences and ideas that included literary experimentation and postmodern theory (notably that of Eco), but also interactive computer fiction, artificial intelligence and story generators, word processing, desktop publishing and the then-new GUI conventions of the Mac, hypertext systems research, and interactive videodisc technology." (Kirschenbaum 177)

"Whatever the fate of its executable code in the years to come, Storyspace has left behind a forensically replete trail of notes, correspondence, journal entries, proposals, bug reports, legal documents, marketing material, and technical documentation." (Kirschenbaum 178)

"a kind of hybrid textuality, fingers first gripping a pencil, now tapping at keys.  This point is more than merely recherch√©, for it has implications not only for how we think about electronic textuality, but also what it means to preserve it." (Kirschenbaum 179-80)

"the variants and revisions I have been enumerating are indicative of the textual condition of all electronic objects, that 'material event or set of events' which, for a critic such as McGann, constitute the 'social text' that is produced under 'specific social and institutional conditions.' The power of such a position, illustrated by attention to the kinds of bibliographic particulars I have been enumerating, is that it recovers works of electronic literature from deceptive strata of pure virtuality and restores them to a temporal and historical situation usually belied by the sheer superficiality of the screen." (Kirschenbaum 185)

"What is the threshold by which mere variants in a text promote the text to the status of a new *version* of the work?  What are the relationships between the physical or documentary incarnations of the work and its version history?  Can evidence from a single witness imply the existence of multiple versions?  Can one infer the existence of a version without its having a locatable basis in an actual document?  Who authorizes and adjudicates versions?  Authors?  Publishers?  Editors?  Can a particular version ever be so radical and wrenching as to constitute a whole new work, rather than merely a version of a previous one?  How are versions to be edited and exhibited to readers?" (Kirschenbaum 187)

"versions entail some reconceptualization or reimagining of the work in question; versions are partly defined by their rhetorical impact on their audiences; and finally, versions are constructed critically by virtue of other artifacts in the documentary field, meaning that the existence of a version is always, in the end, arguable" (Kirschenbaum 188)

"A version is not an inferior derivative of some legitimized and sanctioned work, nor is it simply a collection of observable variants.  Versions are the textual differences that make a difference." (Kirschenbaum 188)

"digital preservation is inseparable from questions of access" (Kirschenbaum 189); see Thibodeau, "Overview of Technological Approaches to Digital Preservation and Challenges in the Coming Years," in _The State of Digital Preservation: An International Perspective_, CLIR (http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub107/thibodeau.html 

"Versioning is a hallmark of electronic textual culture" (Kirschenbaum 197)

"version control systems offer a glimpse of a radically different model of electronic textuality, one in which the state of a document and its relation to prior and past states is pitilessly available and exposed" (Kirschenbaum 199)

"genetic editing seeks to expose the writing process by rendering variants directly in the body of the edited text rather than in an apparatus or some other marginal locale" (Kirschenbaum 199)

"The disadvantage of the genetic approach for scholarly editing is, as John Bryant notes, that it engenders an ironic flattening effect, whereby every variant, no matter how trivial, is elevated to the status of a legitimate editorial (and typographically visible) event, with the result that the very idea of a 'version,' as a meaningful distinction among texts, becomes obscure" (Kirschenbaum 200)

"Versioning thus exposes the cumulative labor that attends a piece of software." (Kirschenbaum 202)

"An electronic document is literally created anew each time it is accessed, symbolically and procedurally reconstituted from the analog bit representations recorded by storage media (magnetic or otherwise), and so it comes to us bearing no forensic traces of prior use, no visible signs of lived experience or worldly contact." (Kirschenbaum 203)

"In short, electronic objects are *functionally* defined by enormous amounts of documentary information, and in a far more systematic and regularized manner than manuscripts and books." (Kirschenbaum 204)

"Software is, in short, a species of artifact.  If we accept this, then we should also accept that those of us who study artifacts like books may one day also want or need to study software -- first learning some of the terminology and technical issues -- out of the conviction that our intellectual perspectives are unique and valuable." (Kirschenbaum 206)

"The point, once again, is just how hard it is to pin any absolute or essential characteristics onto electronic content; rather, the emphasis must fall on user habits when working with that content, and the way developers -- who have the power to functionally define the nature and extent of those habits -- choose to model particular environments and behaviors by way of their software code, consequently imposing a formal materiality." (Kirschenbaum 210)

"Despite real technical obstacles, digital preservation is ultimately a challenge demanding social (above and beyond the purely technological) solutions." (Kirschenbaum 211)


5.  Text Messaging: The Transformations of "Agrippa"

"As an electronic work designed to efface itself, yet paradoxically one of th emost available objects on the Web, 'Agrippa' reminds us that preservation is ultimately a social domain, where actions and agency can serve to trump purely technical considerations." (Kirschenbaum 218)

"In retrospect, the whole _Agrippa_ project -- the artist's book as well as the electronic poem -- was one of the last great memes of the pre-Mosaic Internet." (Kirschenbaum 228)

"Digital preservation turns out to be all about 'codework,' the reading and revealing of codes so that data can be reconstituted in keeping with its original intent.  Thus digital preservation, in practical terms, is about identifying and imposing the requisite formal materiality on an encoded sequence of stored bits (what are sometimes known as BLOBs, or Binary Large Objects in the trade, a euphemism that captures the state of the code, which is homogenous and inactionable until it is activated by the requisite formal environment).
In this context, the encryption of 'Agrippa' the poem is a dramatization of the eventual fate of all digital objects, which will inexorably be reduced to opaque code blocks, or BLOBs, as they become detached and drift away from their native software environments, and as those software environments themselves become distanced from the hardware running the operating systems that support and sustain them.  If _Agrippa_ the book aestheticizes the forensic properties of distress and accelerated aging in the postapocalyptic presentation of its physical materials, then _Agrippa_ (both book and electronic work) also aestheticizes the formal properties of digital code in a like manner, through a radical acceleration of its obsolescence cycle." (Kirschenbaum 234)

Agrippa as "an early exemplar of codework, the genre that has come to be identified with the composition of new media text objects containing either code or pseudo code, sometimes executable and sometimes not, as an integral aspect of their poetics and aesthetic." (Kirschenbaum 235)

"But whereas most literary codework operates at the interface between natural language and high-level programming, scripting, or markup languages (like C\++, Javascript, or HTML), 'Agrippa's' codework lies in its performance of an actual act of encryption and the way that act fuels the work's overall tension between obfuscation and transmission.  Less a text than an ongoing series of textual events over the course of its publication and reception history, _Agrippa_, as a double artifact that is the progeny of both forensic and formal processes, comes closest to a literal embodying of the peculiar nature of electronic objects I have sought to capture in _Mechanisms_: their remarkable staying power and their fugitive abandon." (Kirschenbaum 236)

"cultural pressures to utilize the newest and most advanced forms of digital technology and the expenses (time, expert labor, money) associated with so doing will affect the scholarly industry by radically constricting the number of texts that are reproduced and pushed through the electronic gates; this will result, ironically, in fewer and fewer texts being preserved at precisely the moment we are witnessing the (theoretical) explosion of the capacity for textual reproduction." (Kirschenbaum 236-37)

"'Agrippa' thus demonstrates what the renowned bibliographical scholar D. F. McKenzie influentially called the 'sociology of texts,' and from its example we can see that the preservation of digital media has a pronounced social dimension that is at least as important as purely technical considerations." (Kirschenbaum 240-41)

"the extent to which the network itself, as a redundantly distributed hard drive, functioned as an agent of preservation.  Yet I also found the network cruelly arbitrary" (Kirschenbaum 247)


Coda: The Forensic Imagination

"Crystallizing at the nexus of storage, inscription, and instrumentation, the forensic imagination stands in contrast to the medial ideology an screen essentialism that has held sway in the theoreticaly conversation's critical formative years for new media as a field.  Yet these perspectives are perhaps not finally so much oppositional as cyclical." (Kirschenbaum 254)

"Now that new media is being actively stored in archives and museums, as well as on the network -- deliberately, as in the case of _The Agrippa Files_; socially, through abandonware sites; or automatically, through Google caches or the crawlers of the Wayback Machine -- such absences will become more palpable.  We will feel the loss of what is already missing more keenly." (Kirschenbaum 258-59)
