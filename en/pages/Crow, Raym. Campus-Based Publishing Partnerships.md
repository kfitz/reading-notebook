"despite their commitment to launching digital publishing partnerships, libraries and presses confront issues that limit the progress of such partnerships and slow their
evolution. These issues include: 
- Establishing governance and administrative structures that integrate the core competencies and resources of libraries and presses, without disrupting the broader objectives of either;
- Identifying funding models that accommodate the disparate financial objectives, incentives, and missions of libraries and presses;
- Defining a partnership’s objectives to align the vertical, institution-specific mission of the library with the horizontal, transinstitutional mission of the press;
- Determining what services a partnership should provide, based on the current and future scholarly communication and publishing needs of an institution’s faculty and researchers; and
- Demonstrating the value of a collaboration to university administrators in order to secure resources and long-term support." (Crow 1-2)

"although this guide discusses campus-based publishing partnerships in general, it focuses on partnerships that include a press and a library. Other academic units —including academic computing, media centers, digital humanities and cultural heritage programs, and academic departments and research institutes — may play primary roles in partnerships or in partnership-sponsored projects. Each of these units will have its own mission and operating strategy that it seeks to advance through its participation in an alliance, and each will have a funding model that it needs to accommodate." (Crow 2)

"An analysis of current and recent publishing collaborations, undertaken in the winter of 2007/2008, identified ongoing initiatives at 26 institutions, comprising approximately 40 individual projects. As this guide focuses on issues that confront partnering organizations with disparate operating requirements, the analysis of existing initiatives concentrates on partnerships in which both a university press and a library participated. As a result, we have necessarily excluded many campus-based publishing projects that do not include both a press and a library as a participant, including a number of e-presses, online journal platforms, reprint programs, online journal aggregations, and online critical editions. About two-thirds of existing library-press collaborations involve just a university press and a library, while the remaining third include other partners, including academic departments, academic computing centers, or scholarly societies" (Crow 5)

types of collaborative projects:  backfile digitization; library online provision of press print titles and supplements; press distribution of library-sponsored content; digital research and reference series; online publishing platforms

"All of the backfile digitization projects appear to have been subsidized by the library or the host institution, with no revenue-generating intent beyond potential print sales of included titles. In many cases, the library instigated the project and coordinated the digital conversion process, with the press providing rights clearance and permission to digitize the content." (Crow 7)

"- All of the digitized backlist projects are fully subsidized, typically by the participating library. In these instances, the press contributes the content, while the library provides the labor and/or funding to undertake the digitization itself. 
- All of the initiatives that entail the library providing online access to content distributed by the press in print combine subsidies with earned revenue. In virtually every case, the library and press income models operate in parallel, with the library’s participation subsidized, and the press’s participation covered by earned revenue.
- Most projects for which the press handles marketing and distribution of print content created or controlled by the library also operate under a parallel subsidy-earned revenue model. 
- Half of the online research and reference services are sustained exclusively by subsidies and half are supported through a parallel subsidy-earned revenue approach." (Crow 11-12)

"Although university libraries and presses are not in open conflict, their respective missions — one centered on the research and teaching needs of the host institution; the other on serving the academy as a whole — differ in significant ways. At the same time, libraries and presses share the ethos of the academy, recognize the need to address fundamental problems in the current system of scholarly publishing, and understand the interdependence of their organizations in achieving a solution." (Crow 13)

"collaboration will require libraries and presses to coordinate their own interests and those of other stakeholders — most notably, their faculty and university administrations — and to act multilaterally, potentially ceding some operating autonomy" (Crow 13)

"Libraries and presses can realize synergies from partnerships that combine the organizations’ complementary capabilities.  A collaboration can combine competencies, technical expertise, and financial resources to provide services beyond the capabilities of the organizations acting independently." (Crow 14)

"Partnerships can allow both libraries and presses to gain economies of scale by combining programs to serve their constituents’ needs efficiently." (Crow 14)

"In addition to combining expertise and resources, collaborations allow the partners to increase their visibility, effectiveness, and political position within their institution." (Crow 14)

"Although collaborative activity cannot reverse the decline in market demand for print monographs, it can allow presses to pursue digital publishing programs that focus on evolving research publication genres (such as online thematic research collections and digital critical editions) that would otherwise be beyond their resources." (Crow 15)

"As most university presses lack the capital to develop extensive digital publishing programs, working with libraries and with academic computing centers provides an opportunity for presses to expand their digital publishing capacities." (Crow 15)

"As the financial pressure on university presses increases, the strategic importance of partnering with libraries, and other university units will increase. As noted above, savings-oriented alliances can improve the image of the partnering organizations with an institution’s administration." (Crow 16)

"While conceptually obvious, aligning a press’s activity with the research and teaching objectives of its host institution can be practically difficult. Although many presses already publish regional titles or series that feature their institutions’ research strengths, emphasizing such an alignment by developing new publishing programs will typically entail risk and experimentation." (Crow 16-17)

"Many institutions regard their presses as financial liabilities despite many presses recovering over 90% of their operating costs from earned revenue. A partnership with the library can provide a press with a visible demonstration of its alignment with, and value to, its host institution." (Crow 17)

"Focusing a collaboration’s activities on publishing services that serve the research and teaching needs of the host institution may qualify those activities for subsidies, either via the library or directly from the host institution, that might not be available to the press acting on its own." (Crow 17)

"To serve the needs of faculty, given the intrinsic link between scholarly publication and the tenure and promotion process, campus-based publishing collaborations must provide both broad dissemination and qualitative evaluations of the research they publish. Partnering with the university’s press, which has traditionally provided this validation, can allow the library to offer publishing services that serve the expressed needs of the institution’s faculty and demonstrate the value of the channel for the purposes of tenure and promotion. Further, academic departments, which have responsibility for setting academic standards and conducting faculty evaluation, can also play a central role in such partnerships." (Crow 17-18)

"Many of the current library-press collaborations identify the exploration of innovative publishing business models as a primary objective of the partnership. Given their expenditure-based funding models, few academic libraries have an existing competence in developing or administering business models that have a significant revenue-generating component. Partnering with a press can afford the library access to expertise and operational support in developing and managing earned revenue models. Further, the press brings a market discipline that can help ensure that a partnership develops services designed to address the needs of its constituencies." (Crow 18-19)

"Libraries and university presses share much in common: both operate on a nonprofit model and each seeks, in its own way, to fulfill a mission that serves the needs of its host institution. However, there are real differences in the operating structures and strategies of libraries and presses, and these must be reconciled to allow a library-press partnership to realize its full potential." (Crow 20-21)

"some university presses may view the range of potential business models narrowly, focusing on established market models, even when those models are beginning to fail. However, considering the limited resources, slim margins, and cost-recovery expectations under which presses must typically operate, this conservatism is scarcely surprising." (Crow 21)

"Libraries and academic computing centers are funded by institutional standing budgets, while university presses generate most or all of their operating budgets through earned revenue from market activities. A typical breakdown of an institutional library’s funding sources would include about 75-85% from university appropriations and about 5-15% from designated funds, with the balance coming from sponsored programs and endowments. In terms of expense categories, approximately 45% of a university library’s budget will typically cover staff costs and 40% will go towards materials acquisitions, with other operating expenses representing 15% of the budget." (Crow 21)

"As presses depend on earned revenue for 80-90% of their operating budgets, they must manage their publishing activities overall to balance mission fulfillment and revenue generation." (Crow 21)

"For presses and libraries to collaborate successfully requires a funding model and financial structure that allows the press to participate without diverting resources from other mission-critical publishing programs." (Crow 22)

"If the partnership emphasizes open-access models, or provides products or services that cannot capture sufficient value on the open market, then the potential for generating self-sustaining revenue from those activities may be limited. Even where its activities are capable of generating earned revenue, a market approach might compromise the collaboration’s mission and objectives by limiting its target audiences’ access to the products or services it offers." (Crow 22)

"As long as the income-generating activities are well aligned with the partnership’s mission — and revenue generation serves as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself — the market activity may contribute positively to achieving the mission." (Crow 23)

"As Bok and others have observed, market forces compel nonprofit entities to assess both what they do and how well they do it." (Crow 24)

"The issue in applying business principles and practices is not that a partnership should alter its mission — in terms of what it publishes or the constituencies it serves — in order to generate a surplus. Rather, that in serving its mission, the collaboration operates as efficiently and cost effectively as possible given the resources available." (Crow 24)

"Undertaking a project with no framework for evaluating whether or how it has succeeded will weaken a partnership’s ability to learn from experience, decreasing its chances for success in future projects that may require more resources and entail greater risk." (Crow 29)

"The point is not to monetize every activity and benefit: the goal is to describe explicitly how an initiative aligns with the priorities of the host institution and to demonstrate its value relative to the investment required to support it." (Crow 39)

"About 11% of presses now report to the library" (Crow 44)

"Publishing alliances are not limited to partnerships between units at a single institution. As there are approximately 2,500 four-year colleges and universities in North America, and only about one hundred university presses, there may well be demand for cross-institutional partnerships." (Crow 47)

"A multiple-institution solution may prove critical to establishing the credibility of new publishing programs, as well as the legitimacy of emerging digital research publication genres." (Crow 47)
