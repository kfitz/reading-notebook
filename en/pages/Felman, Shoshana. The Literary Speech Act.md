Felman, Shoshana.  The Literary Speech Act:  Don Juan with J. L. Austin, or Seduction in Two Languages (1980).  Trans. Catherine Porter.  Ithaca, NY:  Cornell University Press, 1983.

Preface:  The Promising Animal.

does promising define “the problematics of the human” (Felman 9)? — see Nietzsche

centering of research into performatives on promising — see Searle

“In what way does a promise constitute a paradox, a problem?  In what way is the very logic of promising a sign of a fundamental contradiction which is precisely the contradiction of the human?” (Felman 10)

questions implied by the performative, but not so much linguistic as literary; exist at the heart of the myth of Don Juan

“Don Juan obviously abuses the institution of promising.  But what does this abuse signify about promising itself?  The scandal of seduction seems to be fundamentally tied to the scandal of the broken promise.” (Felman 11)

book asks how research on performative sheds light on Don Juan, and vice versa

the literary as the “meeting and testing ground of the linguistic and the philosophical, the place where linguistics and philosophy are interrogated but also where they are pushed beyond their disciplinary limits.” (Felman 11)

the literary in this meeting ground opens onto a scandal:  “the scandal (which is at once theoretical and empirical, historical) of the incongruous but indissoluble relation between language and the body; the scandal of the seduction of the human body insofar as it speaks...” (Felman 12)

I.  Between Linguistics and Philosophy of Language:  Theories of Promise, Promises of Theory

The Reflections of J.L. Austin:  Between Truth and Felicity

Austin’s work begins by demystifying the philosophical illusion that what is at stake in language is its truth-value

substitutes felicity/infelicity for truth/falsity

Austin’s search for linguistic criteria that absolutely divide constative from performative utterances ultimately fails; the criteria he uncovers are neither exhaustive nor absolute

“as soon as we acknowledge the existence of implicit performatives, it is difficult to find any sentence that would not fall into this category” (Felman 17)

Austin’s desire to demote descriptive statements in their claims to truth-value and demonstrate that they, too, are speech acts

Austin’s general theory of speech acts:  the doctrine of illocution — “the ‘illocutionary act’ is the speech performance examined with reference to the context of the interlocution, to the concrete and conventional discursive situation in which speech acquires, above and beyond its meaning, a certain force of utterance” (Felman 18)

A. distinguishes between meaning and force;  the production of meaning is a locutionary act; the production of force is an illocutionary act; both are distinct from perlocutionary acts, which have effects on the interlocutor

five categories:  verdictives, exercitives, commissives, behabitives, expositives

Emile Benveniste’s Modifications:  Felicity and Legitimacy

maintains distinction between constative and performative; dissociates from illocutionary

B. excludes the theory of illocutionary forces, the theory of infelicities of the performative, clichés

B. adds four specifications:  “Performative utterances are always acts of authority; of legitimate authority, to be sure.” (Felman 21); “Insofar as it is an act, the performative utterance has the property of being unique.” (Felman 21) — thus performatives cannot be repeated; “The performative is defined by a singular property, that of being self-referential, of referring to a reality that it constitutes itself.” (Felman 21); “The performative utterance is an act of naming the act performed and its agent.” (Felman 22)

II.  The Perversion of Promising:  Don Juan and Literary Performance

The Don Juan Conflict and Illocutionary Forces of Commitment

“With the exception of the end, that is, of the supernatural conclusion, the action of Molière’s Don Juan is made up entirely of performative events...” (Felman 25)

threats as negative promises:  “if promising consists in committing oneself to do something for someone, then, similarly, threatening consists in committing oneself to do something against someone.” (Felman 26)

the paradox of the promise structures the play’s conflict:  “It is within the illocutionary category of commitment that both the division and the opposition [between two forces of promising and threatening] are produced.” (Felman 26)

Opposing Views of Language

“What is really at stake in the play — the real conflict — is, in fact, the opposition between two views of language, one that is cognitive, or constative, and another that is performative.” (Felman 26-27)

conflict between those who seek truth in speech and those (Don Juan) who seek play, pleasure:  “Language, for Don Juan, is performative and not informative; it is a field of enjoyment, not of knowledge.” (Felman 27)

Linguistic Felicity

“To seduce is to produce felicitous language.” (Felman 28)

“The Donjuanian act of seduction in this way makes concrete the relation, and the problem of the relation, among the three meanings of the word ‘act,’ three meanings that are homologous, moreover, with the three connotations of the word performance in English:  the erotic connotation, the theatrical connotation, and the linguistic connotation....  The Don Juan myth, in other words, dramatizes the notion of human action as the question of the relation between sexual act and speech act, between speech act and theatrical act.” (Felman 29)

but Felman never really talks about the theatrical...

The Rhetoric of Seduction

“The rhetoric of seduction consists, in fact, almost exclusively in the deployment of speech acts:  Donjuanian debauchery is in reality above all a debauchery of explicit performatives — commissive performatives which are used, moreover, to seduce men just as much as women.” (Felman 30)

“The trap of seduction thus consists in producing a referential illusion through an utterance that is by its very nature self-referential:  the illusion of a real or extralinguistic act of commitment created by an utterance that refers only to itself.” (Felman 31)

“The specular illusion of self-reference allows Don Juan to elude the status of referent.” (Felman 32)

Eroticism and Theology

Don Juan cannot believe, because “he knows perfectly well that belief is only the effect of the reflection, the reflexivity that he exploits” (Felman 32); as language does not communicate truth, but rather performs, there is nothing to believe

“Like eroticism, theology in the Don Juan myth is played out exclusively on the stage of language.  Donjuanian unbelief is above all disbelief in the capacity of language to name a transitive truth.” (Felman 33)

The Promise of Marriage

necessary link between promising and marriage — espousing

illusion of constancy in the performance of marriage — not, in fact, a constative

Theology and Arithmetic

DJ’s “belief” in arithmetic — a field of facts that is self-referential and non-linguistic

Genetic Reasoning, or the Promise of Paternity

Anaphora/Metaphor

death and rebirth; forgetting; repetition of beginnings

Death’s Crossings, or the Paradox of the Limit

“If Donjuanian eroticism presents itself, structurally and symbolically, as a relation with death, the passage from one woman to another, that is, the promise-breaking itself, turns out to be a breach in memory (a breach in the memory of desire) to the extent that it constitutes an act of forgetting death.” (Felman 41)

The Teaching of Rupture

“Thus Don Juan is not only a master but a professor of rupture.  Even while making his own promises, he teaches the others, through the irony of their own behavior and through the needs of their flesh, that promises as such are liable to be broken.” (Felman 43)

separation as essential to seduction; connected to the Artaudian sense of cruelty

“Molière’s Don Juan is thus attached to the theater of cruelty to the extent that the play dramatizes the very cruelty of the performative:  the cruelty of the speech act — the quintessential act of the speaking body — inasmuch as it comprises an ineluctable necessity of rupture or break.” (Felman 44)

The Donjuanian Cutting Edge

DJ’s misstroke at the ghost as a misfired performative

The Fastest Runner, or the Space of a Movement

the play’s discontinuities:  “Modeled on the paradoxes of the direction and meaning of Don Juan’s movement, dramatizing these paradoxes, the eventful and discontinuous structure of Molière’s play problematizes the relation of eroticism to time as a subversion of linear time and as a deconstruction of the before/after dichotomy and of the behind/ahead opposition.” (Felman 48)

The Haste Function:  The Temporality of the Promise

ties of promises to speed and urgency; Lacan’s “the haste function”

“If Don Juan ‘fails to keep his word,’ it is because his word, his promise, is at the outset constituted by the act of failing, missing:  missing (failing) the present.” (Felman 49)

The Act of Missing, or Repetition

the play as “a signifying chain of promises which engender each other reciprocally, and whose connecting principle is their own failure to be kept.” (Felman 50)

Don Juan’s subversion of authority through the repetition of promises; recall Benveniste’s assertion that performatives must be unique and non-repeatable

“If Don Juan subverts the uniqueness of the promise by repeating precisely the promise of uniqueness — the promise of marriage, the supremely unique act — it is in order to ruin not the performance of language, but its authority.” (Felman 50)

that authority rests in the first person:  “The multiplication of promises brings out the division inherent in the first person.  The first person is thus itself subject to the cardinal law of number, that is, to the repetition of breaches.” (Felman 51)

The Promise of Consciousness

DJ is in “a parasitic relation to the promise — like that of symptom to thought, of the unconscious to consciousness:  by bringing out, through repetition, the breach which is inherent in the promise but which it represses and conceals.  On the contrary, every promise promises the completion of incompleteness; every promise is above all the promise of consciousness, insofar as it postulates a noninterruption, continuity between intention and act.” (Felman 51)

DJ as “the symptom of the self-subverting power of the performative.  Indeed, the Don Juan myth is the myth of the performative only in that the performative, pushed to its extreme logical consequences, enacts its own subversion.  What the myth of the speaking body, in other words, performs, is the very subversion of consciousness.” (Felman 51)

The Triple Dénouement, or the Promise of Ending

multiplicity of ending reveals that “the Don Juan myth is precisely the myth of the repetition of the end.” (Felman 53)

multiple endings reveal the “disappearance of the Don Juan scandal” (Felman 53)

The Dinner Invitation, or the Stone Feast

From Mouth to Hand

“It is not unimportant that Don Juan’s fantastic death is thus associated with the mouth of an organ of pleasure.  In a way, one might say that the Don Juan myth of the mouth is the precise place of mediation between language and the body.” (Felman 55-56)

Engagement and Wages

third ending undermines second; debt not paid after all

“Thus the three endings of Molière’s play do not manage to keep the promise of ending itself:  the promise of creating meaning, of bringing satisfaction to desire, of eliminating the scandal.” (Felman 57-58)

III.  The Scandal of the Performative

“If the conceptual economy of the performative proves to govern the Don Juan myth in Molière’s interpretation, might Molière’s text in turn shed light on the theoretical, linguistic, and philosophical stakes in research on the performative?  Might the question of the relation between the erotic and the linguistic — the Donjuanian problem par excellence — provide a way of looking at linguistics and analytic philosophy, might it in some way inform speech act theory?” (Felman 61)

Austin’s Donjuanism

“...Austin’s fundamental gesture, like Don Juan’s, consists in substituting, with respect to utterances of language, the criterion of satisfaction for the criterion of truth.” (Felman 61)

significance of “felicity”/”infelicity” — dimension of pleasure

Austin as unbeliever, iconoclast; role of forgetting and anaphora; failure of promise of ending

“The fact that research itself comes to an unhappy ending (which by that very token it considers a nonending, a need to start all over again) may mean that research, subjected to the felicity/infelicity criterion, constitutes in itself a performance more than a statement, that it too belongs to the order of the performative rather than to that of the constative.” (Felman 63)

“the Austinian analysis, if it is an act, is only the act of failing to grasp the constative of the performative” (Felman 63)

self-subversive nature of the performative; the theory of the performative deconstructs itself

The Question of the Ground

Benveniste cannot accept this self-subversion in the Austinian performance

“can the performative, as such, serve as the basis or ground for the theory?” (Felman 64) — B. says yes; A. says no:  “the very performance of the performative consists precisely in performing the loss of footing:  it is the performance of the loss of the ground” (Felman 64)

“In the eyes of its creator, the performative instrument, although tending toward the constative..., is itself performative, that is, capable above all of the act of failing, of missing or of losing ground, an act itself constituted by the lack of means inherent in falling or skidding.” (Felman 65)

B.’s exclusion of the theory of infelicities from the linguistic performative:  “A performative utterance that is not an act does not exist.” (B. 236)

“Infelicity, or failure, is not for Austin an accident of the performative, it is inherent in it, essential to it.” (Felman 66)

Breach of Promise

finally, for Austin, the performative doesn’t pay (see wages & Don Juan)

B. “reproaches Austin with nothing short of his Donjuanism:  his inconstancy, his infidelity to his own beginning, to his own initial distinction.  In other words, Benveniste reproaches Austin for failing to keep his word:  for not keeping his promise of a constative of the performative.” (Felman 67)

“Thus, at the end of its argument, the philosophy of language invalidates its own hypotheses, whereas at the end of its argument linguistics validates its own hypotheses.” (Felman 68)

“Like linguistics, literature believes in meaning; like the philosophy of language, it deconstructs its own belief.  Between the authority of the broken promise and the authority of the promise believed in, between Sganarelle and Don Juan, Benveniste and Austin, literature is precisely the impossibility of choice:  the impossibility of keeping the promise of meaning, of consciousness; the impossibility of not continuing to make this promise and to believe in it.”  (Felman 68)

IV.  Knowledge and Pleasure, or the Philosopher’s Performance (Psychoanalysis and the Performative)

“In the foregoing pages I have tried to do things with Austin’s words:  I have sought to bring to light — by putting it to work — the fecundity of the performative, grasping it in its passage through the literary ‘thing.’” (Felman 73)

“the history of linguistic philosophy — the history of Austin’s influence and of the theoretical consolidation of his thinking about the performative — reflects an appropriation of the constative aspect of the theory, but hardly at all of its performative aspect.” (Felman 73)

The Status of the Referent, or, What Is Reality?

theory of the performative reintroduces the problem of the referent

“It seems to me that what is important to see — what Austin’s heirs have perhaps lost sight of — is not so much the reintroduction of the referent in the performative, but rather the change of status of the referent as such.” (Felman 75)

change of status seems to “converge or coordinate with the change of status of the referent in an apparently quite different field, that of psychoanalysis” (Felman 75)

similar interests in relations between words and acts

three common features: 

1.  material knowledge of language:  referent cannot be approached directly, but only through language; language carries knowledge of reality — but not constative; the referent is produced as an effect of language; “Referential knowledge of language is not knowledge about reality (about a separate and distinct entity), but knowledge that has to do with reality, that acts within reality, since it is itself — at least in part — what this reality is made of.” (Felman 77)

2.  dialogic reference:  referential aspect of language arises in a dialogic situation (analysis; illocution/perlocution); the excess of utterance over the statement = illocutionary force; “The performative is indeed self-referential, but for Austin this does not mean that it refers to an exhaustive specularity or to a perfect symmetry between statement and enunciation.  On the contrary, it is from asymmetry that Austin’s thought proceeds, from the excess of utterance with respect to statement, from ‘force of utterance’ as a — referential — residue of statement and meaning.” (Felman 79)

3.  the dimension of misfire:  “If the capacity for misfire is an inherent capacity of the performative, it is because the act as such is defined, for Austin, as the capacity to miss its goal and to fail to be achieved, to remain unconsummated, to fall short of its own accomplishment.” (Felman 82); misfires like slips and parapraxis in Freud; “in psychoanalysis, as in the domain of the performative, the real is defined exclusively in terms of ‘misfires.’” (Felman 82); lack not as thing lacked, but as act of lacking

Theoretical Coincidences, or the Missed Encounter between Languages

coincidences between theories; “Psychoanalysis teaches us, however, that coincidences, in the history of the subject, are governed not by chance but by another kind of logic, specifically that of the unconscious.” (Felman 86)

“To say that there are theoretical coincidences between Lacan and Austin is to say that something happens, in the history of thought, between languages, between tongues.” (Felman 86)

missed encounters between English and French theory produced by difference in languages

“Now the theoretical relations seems to me all the more interesting in that it proceeds from this historical nonrelation; the theoretical encounter is in fact all the more rich in teaching and questioning in that it proceeds precisely from the nonmeeting, from the (theoretically and historically) missed meeting between languages.” (Felman 91)

“Now if Lacan and Austin communicate at the very level of untranslatability, of the missed encounter between languages, it is because their theoretical thought is itself, above all, a linguistic act.” (Felman 92)

Between Body and Language, or, What Is an Act?

both psychoanalysis and performative theory fundamentally involved in rethinking the human act

“If the problem of the human act thus consists in the relation between language and body, it is because the act is conceived — by performative analysis as well as by psychoanalysis — as that which problematizes at one and the same time the separation and the opposition between the two.  The act, an enigmatic and problematic production of the speaking body, destroys from its inception the metaphysical dichotomy between the domain of the ‘mental’ and the domain of the ‘physical,’ breaks down the opposition between body and spirit, between matter and language.” (Felman 94)

“the essence of tragedy might not be the act, but rather the speech act...the tragic act par excellence turns out not to be murder but a speech performance” (Felman 95)

“For psychoanalysis, like the performative, is above all a quest for happiness:  a quest for the felicity of acts.” (Felman 96)

The Subject (of the) Unconscious, or the Miner’s Lamp

Austin on excuses

“If the theory of illocution studies the act in relation to its intentional context, intentionality itself... is often studied as stemming from a discontinuity or from a break in intention.  Intention, for Austin, is scarcely present to itself, scarcely conscious” (Felman 100)

Erotics and Linguistic Philosophy, or the Feast of Language

the pleasure of philosophy/language connected to eating, eroticism

“Like Don Juan, Austin draws upon a rhetoric of seduction, a strategy that uses speech acts of solicitation:  teaching, like love, becomes a performance of promising, an act of commitment (a commissive, an espousal) that indeed engages desire and pleasure.” (Felman 105)

The Last Word of Scandal

speech act “is modeled on a metaphorics of the ‘performance’ of the sexual act” (Felman 108)

moreover, Austin’s use of first person examples creates a theoretical performance that likewise participates in the pleasures of the acts

failures of performativity take on particularly sexualized connotations:  misfires and abuses — Freud:  sex is always a failure

“If the problem of the Don Juan myth is in fact the problem of the relation of the erotic and the linguistic, the scandal lies not so much in the fact that the linguistic is always erotic, but in the much more scandalous fact that the erotic is always linguistic.  In other words, the scandal lies less in sex than in language...” (Felman 110)

“Thus Austin, like Don Juan, reveals the erotic scandal of linguistic philosophy — the incongruous interdependence of the failed operations of sex and language.” (Felman 111)

Beyond the Felicity Principle:  The Performance of Humor

humor as performative — making someone laugh

Austin’s use of humor in the performance of his theory

such humor as a subversive act; “what Austin’s titles do, through humor, is to suspend their own entitlement — their own authority.” (Felman 126)

What History Cannot Assimilate, or the Stone Feast

Austin criticized for defending seriousness over play

“The distinguishing feature of the Austinian performance is not that it turns ‘seriousness’ against ‘unseriousness,’ but rather that it blurs the boundaries between the two.” (Felman 131)

continental reception of Austin has missed his spirit of play; Anglo-Saxon reception have missed the reason for it, and attempted to “save” him from it, attempting “to exclude anomaly and to eliminate the scandal of infelicity” (Felman 132)

Grice, Katz, both attempting to correct Austin’s unseriousness

“Thus one saves Austin from Austin by eliminating from the theory his very consideration of acts (as opposed to meanings) and his reference to the reality of the context” (Felman 135)

“Austin’s theroretical consecration, the institutionalization of his theory of speech acts — an effect of its subversive seduction — is thus achieved only through the loss of its cutting edge, that is, of the subversive aspect of seduction.” (Felman 137)

the performative as a “scientific epidemic” — appears to be single emergence, but is in fact a radical break — like psychoanalysis; but in the acceptance of such new ideas, their negativity is eliminated

“The self-referentiality of history is, in other words, itself condemned to ‘misfire’: but this constative misfiring is what makes history, is indeed what the historical performative derives from.” (Felman 144)

A New Type of Materialism, or the Gift of What One Does Not Have

on what Austin does with words:  “...he not only produces laughter, produces pleasure, produces slips and stumbles, explodes beliefs and prejudices, produces a theoretical fiasco or fails to meet his own ends, to keep his own promise, but also that, in doing this (like Freud, like Lacan, like Nietzsche, and moreover like Marx), he makes history:  that his speech act participates in what one might well call the logic of the scandal of historical practice, owing to the very fact that it has enough force to set in motion a systematic series of misunderstandings, that is, a historical operation — no doubt unconscious — of repression.” (Felman 145)

“Modern Don Juans, they know that truth is only an act.  That is why they subvert truth and do not promise it, but promise themselves to it.” (Felman 150)
