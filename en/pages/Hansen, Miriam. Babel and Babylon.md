INTRODUCTION: CINEMA SPECTATORSHIP AND PUBLIC LIFE

The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight: “the cinematic mediation of the event gave women access to a spectacle from which they traditionally had been excluded” (Hansen 1)

“Taking the fate of the matinee idol to unprecedented extremes, Valentino became an emblem of the simultaneous liberalization and commodification of sexuality that crucially defined the development of American consumer culture.” (Hansen 2)

the spectator/spectatorship as fundamental category of cinema

“When, how, and to what effect does the cinema conceive of the spectator as a textual term, as the hypthetical point of address of filmic discourse?  And once such strategies have been codified, what happens to the viewer as a member of a plural, social audience?” (Hansen 2)

“the configuation of vision and desire seems to violate a long-standing taboo in patriarchal culture — the taboo on an active female gaze, linked to the woman’s traditional position as object of spectacle” (Hansen 2)

“the emergence of cinema spectatorship is profoundly intertwined with the transformation of the public sphere, in particular the gendered itineraries of everyday life and leisure” (Hansen 2)

“Despite the theoretical recognition that there is more to reception that textually and ideologically predetermined subject positions, the spectator of film theory remains a somewhat abstract and ultimately passive entity.” (Hansen 4)

“What is missing from any theory that conceptualizes the spectator as a function — or effect — of a closed, albeit flexible, system, be it the formal codes of narration or the script of Ideology, is a place for the public dimension of cinematic reception.” (Hansen 7)

Habermas and the public sphere

“the bourgeois public sphere was gendered from the start” (Hansen 10)

“the emergence of the category of the spectator as a historical construction that does not necessarily coincide with the invention of cinema” (Hansen 16)

“the different organization of film-viewer relations in early cinema” (Hansen 16)

“the emergence of spectatorship from the angle of audience composition” (Hansen 16)

“the contradictions posed by this development — the industry’s massive catering to women viewers in a medium that increasingly depended, for the kinds of pleasure it offered the viewer, on a patriarchal organization of vision along the axis of sexual difference” (Hansen 18)

PART I. REBUILDING THE TOWER OF BABEL: THE EMERGENCE OF SPECTATORSHIP

1. A CINEMA IN SEARCH OF A SPECTATOR: FILM-VIEWER RELATIONS BEFORE HOLLYWOOD

“classical cinema offered its viewer an ideal vantage point from which to witness a scene, unseen by anyone belonging to the fictional world of the film, the diegesis” (Hansen 23)

“the spectator became part of the film as product, rather than a particular exhibition or show” (Hansen 23)

AN EXCESS OF APPEALS

“as cinema, as a particular type of social and aesthetic experience, the reception of films was without institutional precedent” (Hansen 25)

“even at this early stage the cinema’s sense of its own, albeit brief, history is inscribed with a tendency toward subsumption and integration characteristic of the later institution” (Hansen 28)

“the celebration of cinema as a unique invention concealed frm the start the heterogeneity of the medium’s origins, its fundamental character of bricolage” (Hansen 29)

“In a rather basic sense, early film-spectator relations were determined — and overdetermined — by the contexts in which films were first exhibited: vaudeville and variety shows, dime museums and penny arcades, summer parks, fair grounds, and traveling shows.” (Hansen 29)

DIVERSITY AND DISPLAY

“A number of early films advertise the process of vision itself, the cinema’s capability of bringing objects into view” (Hansen 33)

ANOTHER KIND OF VOYEURISM

“The type of shot considered most characteristic of the ‘primitive’ style is the theatrical tableau” (Hansen 34)

“With their emphasis on display, early films are self-consciously exhibitionist, whereas classical cinema disavows its exhibitionist quality in order to maintain the spell of the invisible gaze” (Hansen 36)

“The difference between the early use of point of view and its later, classical function is not merely narrative motivation but a deliberate yoking together of vision and truth, a moral inscription of the gaze that has come to be associated with the name of D.W. Griffith.” (Hansen 41)

EXHIBITION AS PUBLIC PERFORMANCE

NARRATIVE, INTERTEXTUALITY, GENRE CROSSING

“What distinguishes primitive forms of narrative from the model developed after 1907? What kind of relations do early narratives set up with their viewer? What are the implications of the reduction of nonfictional genres and the decline of trick films and comedies? What happened to the unabashed display of visibility and other aspects of primitive fascination?” (Hansen 45)

NARRATIVE PERSPECTIVE AND UPWARD MOBILITY

“upward mobility enters film-viewer relations as already accomplished, inasmuch as spectatorial pleasure is frequently bound up with a position of social and epistemological superiority” (Hansen 58)

2. EARLY AUDIENCES: MYTHS AND MODELS

“It has been a long cherished assumption in survey histories and journalistic views of Hollywood that the first motion picture audiences were mainly immigrant and working-class and that this was the single most important factor in shaping American cinema as an institution.  The assumption is problematic because it not only underrates other influences and interest, but it also invites suspicion as one of the staples of Hollywood’s ideology about itself — a myth of origin that would advertise a giant corporate enterprise as a genuinely democratic popular culture.” (Hansen 60)

“Access to this new public sphere was defined primarily in economic terms (with the exception of varying degrees of racial segregation), rather than by the exclusive standards of cultural tradition and social hierarchy.  Concomitantly, the ideological orientation of the new entertainment forms, especially vaudeville and amusement parks, was toward blurring any class divisions among its patrons, offering them participation in an ostensibly classless, Americanized, community of leisure.” (Hansen 61)

“moviegoing marked significant changes in the patterns of working-class culture itself — changes, specifically, from an ethically separatist, inward-looking public sphere to a more inclusive, multiethnic one; and from a gender-segregated public sphere . . . to a heterosocial one” (Hansen 62)

THE SOCIAL THEME: REPRESENTATION AND ADDRESS

A NEW UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE: SPECTATORSHIP

“Mobilized in part against the threat of censorship, the defense of film as a universal language plays upon the utopian vision of a means of communication among different people(s). At the same time it foreshadows the subsumption of all diversity in the standardized idiom of the culture industry, monopolistically distributed from above.” (Hansen 76)

“By taking class out of the working class and ethnic difference out of the immigrant, the universal-language metaphor in effect became a code word for broadening the mass-cultural base of motion pictures in accordance with middle-class values and sensibilities.” (Hansen 78)

“the simultaneous deployment and masking of strategies of spectator positioning, the legendary ‘invisibility’ of classical techniques, as cinema’s prime mechanism of ideology” (Hansen 81)

“In a basic sense the term ‘spectator’ implied a shift from a collective, plural notion of the film viewer to a singular, unified but potentially universal category, the commodity form of reception.” (Hansen 84)

“The invention of spectatorship thus marks a point in which the representational processes of cinema converge with the social and cultural developments discussed earlier, in particular the absorption and transformation of working-class, immigrant audiences.” (Hansen 85)

3. CHAMELEON AND CATALYST: THE CINEMA AS AN ALTERNATIVE PUBLIC SPHERE

“a countercurrent, emphasizing a margin that remains between the ideal of spectatorship operative in production and the social and cultural forms of reception” (Hansen 90)

“The significance of the cinema for these groups emerges in relation to their exclusion from dominant formations of public discourse and their displacement — whether by migration, industrialization, urbanization, or the growing cult of consumption — from older traditions of working-class, ethnic, or gender-specific culture.” (Hansen 91-92)

THEATER EXPERIENCE VERSUS FILM EXPERIENCE

“The implementation of the rule of silence in the motion picture shows not only imposed a middle-class standard of spectatorship; by suppressing alocally and regionally specific linguistic environment — foreign languages, accents, dialects — it contributed to the cultural homogenization of a mass audience.” (Hansen 95)

WOMEN’S ‘CRAVING FOR THE CINEMA’: THE EROSION OF THE SEPARATE SPHERES

“middle-class forms of leisure increasingly were becoming family-centered, that is, they encouraged women’s patronage as long as they were contained within the family.” (Hansen 115)

“the higher the social status of a commercial entertainment form, the more acceptable it became for mixed company” (Hansen 115)

culture of consumption: “For middle-class women this meant a liberation from the narrow confines of domestic space, but also, in the logn run, the surrender of a traditionally female sphere of influence to the corporately organized empire of mass consumption.” (Hansen 116)

“More than any other entertainment form, the cinema opened up a space — a social space as well as a perceptual, experiential horizon — in women’s lives, whatever their marital status, age, or background.” (Hansen 117)

cinema as a “particularly female heterotopia, because . . . it ‘simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted’ the gendered demarcations of private and public spheres” (Hansen 118)

“If modern advertising and the department store had mobilized the female gaze in the service of consumption, the cinema seemed to have institutionalized women’s scopophilic consumption as an end in itself, thus posing a commercially fostered threat to the male monopoly of the gaze.” (Hansen 122)
