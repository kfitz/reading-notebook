on idea of text as closed versus open

"the presupposition of the *pre-eminence of the author*.  If the text is closed, it generally has an author (or a definite number of authors).  Not only is the author the pure and simple generative source of the text but he or she also acts judicially, as it were, because he or she assumes specific rights and duties by the pure and simply fact of making him or herself author of that text.  First, as the author generates the text, he or she is responsible for it.  This means the author is the owner of that text and is therefore obliged to distinguish the original parts (= resulting entirely from his or her own invention) from those which are not original (= resulting from the invention of others).  Furthermore, only the author is recognized as having the right to touch the text and above all to decide when it is *perfectum*.  At the precise moment when the text is *perfectum*, and then only, is it closed to others and can the reader gain access is ROM modality.  The closing of the text moreover applies only to others; for the author (while alive and therefore still owner of the text) the text can endlessly be reopened.  The author can change, supplement, adapt, and modify it as often as he or she wishes.  The author can even copy him or herself alone, as in the case of Pirandello, who continuously reworked parts of his novels for the stage and vice versa: the idea of plagiarism cannot be applied to the author who copies him or herself; only by plagiarizing someone else does plagiarism exist." (Simone 240-41)

"The second presupposition supposes that the text is handed over to the reader by the author in a state of *perfection*, or rather completeness.  The idea of the closed text implies the presupposition that the text is presented to the reader in the *final* version intended by the author, or at least in a single, final, and *ne varieteur* form.  Not even the author recognizes the right to leave the text 'open,' that is, incomplete." (Simone 241)

"A third important presupposition concerns the required *originality* of the text.  The text, inasmuch as it is due to a recognizable author and on presentation is assumed to be *perfectum*, has also to be original, and the well-educated reader takes it for granted that this is the case.  The reader assumes that the text derives wholly or mainly from the author's ideational effort and that the author has distinguished himself or herself from the work carried out by others, even if he or she cannot disregard the existence of texts by others." (Simone 242)

"As a result of these presuppositions the text has a body, or rather an actual *habeas corpus* which prevents others (apart from the author) from touching it and protects it from being interfered with." (Simone 242)

diacritical marks such as title pages, margins, and quotation marks as drawing the boundaries of the text's body

these presuppositions about the closed text and its relationship to the author seem to arise not from print but from writing

but forms arise in the middle ages -- such as compilations, miscellanies, and commentaries -- that "negate the presuppositions that we associate today with the idea of the text, that is, that it should be unified, the work of a single author, and *perfectum*.  Thus this idea is not native and does not original together with the texts (not even the written ones), but intermittently disappears and reappears in the history of culture, continuously arousing interest." (Simone 246)

"'We masters are annotators of the ancients; we do not think up personal inventions,' affirmed William of Conches so as to render the idea that a statement which comes from the copy of a previous author, preferably famous, who has formulated, argued, and written it down, is stronger.  Theoretic and doctrinal innovation is created only through small increases, *per additamenta*, through additions, always gradual and suitably apportioned.  If the text is original and evinces its own claim to originality, it risks being untenable.  Originality is dangerous." (Simone 247-48)

"Written culture throughout the world is based to a great extent on the two procedures of copying and interpolation.  It would therefore be of great interest to reconstruct the history of culture not as a succession of original discontinuities but as an uninterrupted chain of imitations and of textual interferences." (Simone 248-49)

"Our intuitive idea of the text is again changing rapidly.  It is no longer that of a closed and protected entity but that of an open and penetrable object which can be copied and interpolated without limits.  To put it differently, the time is heralded when the protective membrane of the texts will decompose and they will once more become open texts as in the Middle Ages with all the standard concomitant presuppositions." (Simone 249)

"The computer as a writing tool is the very symbol of the open text and perfectly illustrates Plato's vision." (Simone 250)

"All these operations can be carried out not only by the first author of the text, but by anyone else (the typesetter at a printer's, the reader of an electronic book, the forger who willfully wishes to change the text).  In this way the text gradually loses its authorship and the perception that it is the product of an author dwindles in the general consciousness." (Simone 250)
