1.  Introduction:  Ergodic Literature

ergodic = reading as a work of physical construction; extranoematic work required in reading process

problematic nature of term “nonlinear”

“A cyber text is a machine for the production of variety of expression.” (3)

metaphors of labyrinth, etc., collapse distinction between an imaginary world and the representation of that world

“The cybertext puts its would-be reader at risk:  the risk of rejection.” (4)

distinctions between games and narratives

early AI story writing systems:  Tale-spin, Racter (12)

“I wish to challenge the recurrent practice of applying the theories of literary criticism to a new empirical field, seemingly without any reassessment of the terms and concepts involved.” (14) — threatens to turn literary theory into mushy metaphor

problem #2:  describing new text media as radically different, revolutionary — tends toward technological determinism — a binary text/computer rhetoric

must first construct textonomy (map) before beginning textology (study of meaning)

“Where humanistic study used to be genre chauvinistic, it is now medium chauvinistic, organized into empirical fields (literature, art history, theater, mass communication) with not enough critical concern for general or intermediary perspectives.” (16)

“beyond obvious differences of appearance, the real difference between paper texts and computer texts is not very clear” (17)

“To be sure, media are far from neutral, inconsequential carriers of ‘content,’ but the essentialist idea of ‘the computer medium’ as a singular structure of well-defined properties of communication is just as untenable and can be based on only a very limited understanding of computer applications and media theory.” (19)
