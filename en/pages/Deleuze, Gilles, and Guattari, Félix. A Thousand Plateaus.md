Deleuze, Gilles, and Guattari, Félix.  A Thousand Plateaus:  Capitalism and Schizophrenia (1980).  Minneapolis:  University of Minnesota Press, 1987.

Translator’s Foreword (Brian Massumi)

“less a critique than a positive exercise in the affirmative ‘nomad’ thought called for in Anti-Oedipus” (Massumi xi)

1.  Introduction:  Rhizome

book as an assemblage, a multiplicity

rhizomatics v. arborescence

principles of rhizomatics:

“1 and 2.  Principles of connection and heterogeneity:  any point of a rhizome can be connected to anything other, and must be” (Deleuze & Guattari 7)

“3.  Principle of multiplicity:  it is only when the multiple is effectively treated as a substantive, ‘multiplicity,’ that it ceases to have any relation to the One as subject or object, natural or spiritual reality, image and world” (Deleuze & Guattari 8)

“4.  Principle of asignifying rupture:  against the oversignifying breaks separating structures or cutting across a single structure.  A rhizome may be broken, shattered at a given spot, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines” (Deleuze & Guattari 9)

“5 and 6.  Principle of cartography and decalcomania:  a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model.  It is a stranger to any idea of genetic axis or deep structure.” (Deleuze & Guattari 12) — map, not tracing

“A plateau is always in the middle, not at the beginning or end.  A rhizome is made of plateaus” (Deleuze & Guattari 21)

“What takes place in a book composed instead of plateaus that communicate with one another across microfissures, as in a brain?  We call a ‘plateau’ any multiplicity connected to other multiplicities by superficial underground stems in such a way as to form or extend a rhizome.  We are writing this book as a rhizome.  It is composed of plateaus” (Deleuze & Guattari 22)

“An assemblage, in its multiplicity, necessarily acts on semiotic flows, material flows, and social flows simultaneously (independently of any recapitulation that may be made of it in a scientific or theoretical corpus).  There is no longer a tripartite division between a field of reality (the world) and a field of representation (the book) and a field of subjectivity (the author).  Rather, an assemblage establishes connections between certain multiplicities drawn from each of these orders, so that a book has no sequel nor the world as its object nor one or several authors as its subject” (Deleuze & Guattari 23)

book as Nomadology, “the opposite of a history” (Deleuze & Guattari 23)

2.  1914:  One or Several Wolves?

Freud’s recasting of “molecular multiplicities” as “molar unities,” bringing everything back to “the father, the penis, the vagina, Castration with a capital C” (Deleuze & Guattari 27)

wolfness resides in its pack nature:  “In becoming-wolf, the important thing is the position of the mass, and above all the position of the subject itself in relation to the pack or wolf-multiplicity” (Deleuze & Guattari 29)

“Freud tried to approach crowd phenomena from the point of view of the unconscious, but he did not see clearly, he did not see that the unconscious itself was fundamentally a crowd” (Deleuze & Guattari 29)

the body without organs = the dis-organized, multiplicitous body:  “the body without organs is opposed less to organs as such than to the organization of the organs insofar as it composes and organism.  The body without organs is not a dead body but a living body all the more alive and teeming once it has blown apart the organism and its organization…. The full body without organs is a body populated  by multiplicities” (Deleuze & Guattari 30)

distinction between macro- and micro-multiplicities/arborescent and rhizomatic multiplicities — distinction between the molar and the molecular

mass v. pack:  mass = quantity, divisibility, equality, hierarchy, organization, territorialization; pack = small numbers, dispersion, non-divisibility, inequalities, impossibility of totalization or hierarchization, deterritorialization

mass = paranoid; pack = schizo

“There is no question, however, of establishing a dualist opposition between the two types of multiplicities, molecular machines and molar machines; that would be no better than the dualism between the One and the multiple.  There are only multiplicities of multiplicities forming across a single assemblage, operating in the same assemblage:  packs in masses and masses in packs” (Deleuze & Guattari 34)

“There are no individual statements, only statement-producing machinic assemblages” (Deleuze & Guattari 36)

3.  10,000 B.C.:  The Geology of Morals (Who Does the Earth Think It Is?)

body without organs v. stratification

deterritorialization v. reterritorialization as flip sides of same process

abstract machine v. concrete machinic assemblage

4.  November 20, 1923 — Postulates of Linguistics

I.  “Language is Informational and Communicational”

language does not communicate, but rather orders; “Language is made not to be believed but to be obeyed, and to compel obedience” (Deleuze & Guattari 76)

order words; relationship between act and statement; not just in the performative

“In an airplane hijacking, the threat of a hijacker brandishing a revolver is obviously an action; so is the execution of the hostages, if it occurs.  But the transformation of the passengers into hostages, and of the plane-body into a prison-body, is an instantaneous incorporeal transformation, a ‘mass media act’ in the sense in which the English speak of ‘speech acts’” (Deleuze & Guattari 81)

II.  “There is an Abstract Machine of Language That Does Not Appeal to Any ‘Extrinsic’ Factor”

not form v. content, but relative independence of the form of the expression and the form of the content (not signifier/signified)

“general conclusions on the nature of Assemblages… On a first, horizontal axis, an assemblage comprises two segments, one of content, the other of expression.  On the one hand it is a machinic assemblage of bodies, of actions and passions, an intermingling of bodies reacting to one another; on the other hand it is a collective assemblage of enunciation, of acts and statements, of incorporeal transformations attributed to bodies.  Then on a vertical axis, the assemblage has both territorial sides, or reterritorialized sides, which stabilize it, and cutting edges of deterritorialization, which carry it away” (Deleuze & Guattari 88)

“Even technology makes the mistake of considering tools in isolation:  tools exist only in relation to the interminglings that they make possible or that make them possible” (Deleuze & Guattari 90)

III.  “There Are Constants or Universals of Language That Enable Us to Define It as a Homogenous System”

“Of the dualisms established by linguistics, there are few with a more shaky foundation than the separation between linguistics and stylistics:  Because a style is not an individual psychological creation but an assemblage of enunciation, it unavoidably produces a language within a language” (Deleuze & Guattari 97)

“There is therefore no basis for a distinction between a constant and collective language, and variable and individual speech acts.  The abstract machine is always singular, designated by the proper name of a group or individual while the assemblage of enunciation is always collective, in the individual as in the group” (Deleuze & Guattari 100)

IV.  “Language Can Be Scientifically Studied Only under the Conditions of a Standard or Major Language”

“The unity of language is fundamentally political.  There is no mother tongue, only a power takeover by a dominant language that at times advances along a broad front, and at times swoops down on diverse centers simultaneously” (Deleuze & Guattari 101)

“It is futile to criticize the worldwide imperialism of a language by denouncing the corruptions it introduces into other languages… For if a language such as British English or American English is major on a world scale, it is necessarily worked upon by all the minorities of the world, using very diverse procedures of variation” (Deleuze & Guattari 102)

disrupts major v. minor, arguing that there are not two kinds of language, but two kinds of treatment of language

“The problem is not the distinction between major and minor language; it is one of a becoming.  It is a question not of reterritorializing oneself on a dialect or patois but of deterritorializing the major language.  Black Americans do not oppose Black to English, they transform the American English that is their own language into Black English” (Deleuze & Guattari 104-105)

“minor” authors work to conquer the major language, to make it minor, “to place it in a state of continuous variation” (Deleuze & Guattari 105)

“Use the minor language to send the major language racing.  Minor authors are foreigners in their own tongue” (Deleuze & Guattari 105)

notion of minority

5.  587 BC – AD 70:  On Several Regimes of Signs

“We call any specific formalization of expression a regime of signs, at least when the expression is linguistic” (Deleuze & Guattari 111)

need for a pragmatics in the study of language, as language cannot studied separately from its uses



13.  7000 B.C.:  Apparatus of Capture

magician-emperor v. jurist-priest-king and the war machine

machinic enslavement as capture in the state apparatus (denomadization?)

three apparati of capture:  rent, profit, taxation; correspond to three realms of land (as opposed to territory), work (as opposed to activity), money (as opposed to exchange)

“capitalism forms with a general axiomatic of decoded flows” (Deleuze & Guattari 453)

machinic enslavement v. social subjection:  “There is enslavement when human beings themselves are constituent pieces of a machine that they compose among themselves and with other things (animals, tools), under the control and direction of a higher unity.  But there is subjection when the higher unity constitutes the human being as a subject linked to a now exterior object, which can be an animal, a tool, or even a machine.  The human being is no longer a component of the machine but a worker, a user.  He or she is subjected to the machine and no longer enslaved by the machine” (Deleuze & Guattari 456-57)

“It would appear, then, that the modern State, through technological development, has substituted an increasingly powerful social subjection for machinic enslavement” (Deleuze & Guattari 457) — but then dialectically returns to a more powerful machinic enslavement

“If motorized machines constituted the second age of the technical machine, cybernetic and informational machines form a third age that reconstructs a generalized regime of subjection:  recurrent and reversible ‘humans-machines systems’ replace the old nonrecurrent and nonreversible relations of subjection between the two elements; the relation between human and machine is based on internal, mutual communication, and no longer on usage or action” (Deleuze & Guattari 458)

“one is subjected to TV insofar as one uses and consumes it, in the very particular situation of a subject of the statement that more or less mistakes itself for a subject of enunciation (‘you, dear television viewers, who make TV what it is…’); the technical machine is the medium between two subjects.  But one is enslaved by TV as a human machine insofar as the television viewers are no longer consumers or users, nor even subjects who supposedly ‘make’ it, but intrinsic component pieces, ‘input’ and ‘output,’ feedback or recurrences that are no longer connected to the machine in such a way as to produce or use it.  In machinic enslavement, there is nothing but transformations and exchanges of information, some of which are mechanical, others human” (Deleuze & Guattari 458)
