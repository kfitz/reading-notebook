"Contemporary pronouncements about the death of the book are puzzling, for in many ways, it is the book form -- the *combination* of the ability to scroll with the capacity for random access, enabling you to leap from place to place -- that has provided the model which these other cultural technologies seek to emulate." (Stallybrass 42)

"If cultural pessimists claim that no one reads anymore, perhaps they mean that it's becoming rarer for people to submit themselves to the scroll function of books." (Stallybrass 42)

"The book/codex, as an emergent technology, enabled a reader to mark up places discontinuously.  In this sense, the history of the codex is the history of the bookmark." (Stallybrass 42)

"The codex is thus marked not only by its openness but by its bookmarks.  It is represented as above all *indexical*, a technology that uses bookmarks like prosthetic fingers to take the reader easily from place to place." (Stallybrass 43)

"The fifteenth century was a period of comparable change, and one might want to see the invention of printing less as a displacement of manuscript culture than as the culmination of the invention of the navigable book -- the book that allowed you to get your finger into the place you wanted to find in the least possible time." (Stallybrass 44)

"I have found no images of such book-marking systems before the beginning of the fifteenth century.  Do these bookmarks, then, suggest a radical development, not in the art of discontinuous reading as such, but in the *conceptualization* of reading as a practice of discontinuity (a discontinuity already materialized in the fragmentary texts of the most popular late medieval book, the book of hours)?  Such random access for specific ends (to learn all that one can about the common loon, for instance) is now enabled by ever more powerful engines for searching the web.  Yet my Macintosh computer still uses a little hand to travel around the screen and a pointing finger.  And when I find a new website, I add a 'bookmark,' visualized nostalgically at the top of my screen as a blue ribbon." (Stallybrass 46)

"Only certain productively perverse uses of the book have transformed it back into a scroll, most notoriously 'gripping' novels or 'page-turners,' where the teleological drive from page to page mitigates against dipping about or turning back (although not, in the case of the unbearable suspense of a mystery, from skipping forward to find out 'whodunit').  When cultural critics nostalgically recall an imagined past in which readers unscrolled their books continuously from beginning to end, they are *reversing* the long history of the codex and the printed book as indexical forms.  The novel has only been a brilliantly perverse interlude in the long history of discontinuous reading." (Stallybrass 46-47)
