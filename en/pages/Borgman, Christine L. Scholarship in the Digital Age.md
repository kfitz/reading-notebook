Borgman, Christine L. Scholarship in the Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2007.


"While the new technologies receive the most attention, it is the underlying social and policy changes that are most profound and that will have the most lasting effects on the future scholarly environment." (Borgman xvii)

1.  Scholarship at a Crossroads

"This is a critical juncture in building the next generation of scholarly information infrastructure.  The technology has advanced much more quickly than has our understanding of its present and potential uses.  Social research on scholarly practices is essential to inform the design of tools, services, and policies.  Design decisions made today will determine whether the Internet of tomorrow enables imaginative new forms of scholarship and learning -- or whether it simply reinforces today's tasks, practices, laws, business models, and incentives." (Borgman 3)

"Making massive amounts of scholarly output available via institutional or disciplinary repositories will require better tools for indexing, markup, and description at the time of input, and better retrieval mechanisms at the point of output." (Borgman 7)

"Another trend is the blurring of the distinction between primary sources, generally viewed as unprocessed or unanalyzed data, and secondary sources that set data in context, such as papers, articles, and books." (Borgman 8)

"Scholarly data and documents are of most value when they are interconnected rather than independent." (Borgman 10)

2.  Building the Scholarly Infrastructure

"Years of investment in basic technical infrastructure may be required before the payoffs to daily practice can be achieved.  The discourse of digital scholarship already is creating high expectations, raising concerns about whether these expectations can be met in a reasonable period of time."  (Borgman 14)

"Information infrastructure is used here as a collective term for the technical, social, and political framework that encompasses the people, technology, tools, and services used to facilitate the distributed, collaborative use of content over time and distance." (Borgman 19)

"Programmatic research initiatives are political documents, promoting a vision as a means to gain visibility, participation, and funding.  Visions must be grand to attract attention and the promised outcomes must be ambitious to attract money.  Whether or not the full promise of these programs is achieved, their framing offers insights into the collective goals of the agencies that promulgate them." (Borgman 21)

joint NSF and JISC group "proposed a model of cyberinfrastructure in which scientific databases and digital libraries form an 'information and content layer' above the middleware layer that provides the services and underlying core network technologies" (Borgman 23)

"Benefits of digital scholarship are expected to accrue not only to the sciences and technology but also to the social sciences and humanities.  They will accrue in different ways, due to different types of data, research methods, and practices in those fields.... It is essential, however, to recognize that these new opportunities do not benefit all scholars equally.  Investments that advantage some scholars will disadvantage others." (Borgman 29)

"Humanists and social scientists expect new communities to arise around new forms of data and tools, offering examples of 'new fields of study, such as archaeometrics, archaeogenetics, music informatics, new facets of bioethics, and the anthropology of the Internet'" (Borgman 30-31, quoting Unsworth et al 18)

"More problematic is setting and applying criteria for what is new.  In practice, individual scholars will have to make their own claims.  Whether those claims are accepted will depend on norms for peer reviewing, hiring, tenure, and promotion, and the rate at which those norms change." (Borgman 31)

3.  Embedded Everywhere

"Underlying the technical and policy developments are theories and philosophies about what is socially acceptable and appropriate." (Borgman 33)

"open science is based on the premise that scholarly information is a 'public good.' Public goods have two defining elements.  One is that they can be shared without lessening their value; the economic term is 'non-rival.'... The second characteristic of public goods is that they are difficult and costly to hold exclusively while putting them to use; the economic term is 'non-excludable'" (Borgman 35-36)

"socio-technical systems" as a "more moderate middle ground" between technological determinism and social/cultural determinism, "which starts from the premise that technology and society are deeply intertwined and mutually influencing" (Borgman 38)

"Programs in e-Research are largely concerned with building the networks, tools, and services that will enable people to use information.  Relatively little attention is being paid to what information will flow through these networks, other than that it will consist of data, documents, and complex objects, and that large amounts of it will flow." (Borgman 39)

"The best technologies often are those that are the least visible....  People want to spend less time wrestling with technology, and more time doing science or social science, studying the humanities, or learning in those disciplines." (Borgman 43)

4.  The Continuity of Scholarly Communication

"Communication is the essence of scholarship....  Scholarship is an inherently social activity, involving a wide range of public and private interactions within a research community.  Publication, as the public report of research, is part of a continuous cycle of reading, writing, discussing, searching, investigating, presenting, submitting, and reviewing.  No scholarly publication stands alone.  Each new work in a field is positioned relative to others through the process of citing relevant literature." (Borgman 47)

"An information infrastructure to support scholarship must facilitate these myriad means of communication.  Scholars use the Internet to communicate with more people, and more frequently, than was feasible in the days of paper and post.  They can also share much larger volumes of data and documents." (Borgman 47)

"Because anyone can 'publish' online,the balance between authors, publishers, and librarians has shifted radically.... Preserving the scholarly record is more difficult in a digital world than a print one, due to the rapid evolution of technology, changes in intellectual property regulations, and new business models for publishing." (Borgman 47-48)

"Although it may appear that the Internet is blurring the boundaries between public and private, and between formal and informal communication, these lines were never distinct." (Borgman 48)

"What has changed most since the days of print and post is the balance between public and private communication.  Conversations that previously were oral are now conducted by e-mail or online discussion lists, sometimes leaving a public record for a long period of time.  Presentations that would have been heard by a few people at a seminar are now widely available online via the posting of slides, speaking notes, and Webcasts.  Manuscripts, preprints, technical reports, and other written works that were circulated privately are now posted publicly.  Online communication has accelerated the amount of informal communication among scholars and simplified the dissemination of formal products of scholarship." (Borgman 49)

"As the means for knowledge sharing and publication have changed, so ahve relationships among the many stakeholders in scholarly communication." (Borgman 55)

"Academic scholarship has operated in what anthropologists refer to as a 'gift exchange culture'" (Borgman 56)

"Sharing knowledge is the social glue that holds academic communities together, and publication is the coin of the realm.  As the processes and structures of scholarly communication evolve, basic tenets of peer review and intellectual property that underlie the open science model are being questioned." (Borgman 56)

"In assessing relationships between scholarly communication, electronic publishing, and the Internet, Kling and his colleagues conclude that most of the future scenarios for electronic publishing did not play out as predicted due to a focus on structural factors (the standard model) without adequate account of the social factors" (Borgman 57)

peer review as means of quality control, used both for assessing scholarship and scholars themselves

"Evaluation also can be mechanistic, using publication indicators as proxies for quality of scholarship.  In these cases, quality-control processes for scholarly content can easily become distorted." (Borgman 58)

"Prepublication methods are 'ex ante' forms of quality control" (Borgman 58)

"Quality criteria vary widely by field, but all have to do with whether the work meets acceptable norms for method, validity, reliability (in the case of empirical research), evidence, documentation of sources, adequacy of claims, quality of writing and presentation, and degree of contribution to the field." (Borgman 58) -- ideally, perhaps

"Prepublication review, whether of articles, conference papers, or books, is intended to improve the published product." (Borgman 59) -- again, ideally

"Postpublication quality control, or 'ex post' review, occurs after a work is published." (Borgman 59)

postpublication review includes "online commenting or annotation after publication, creating a 'living document' of the original plus all the comments.  A similar model is to rate posted documents, with scores computed and posted, as is dome by online bookstores and auction sites.  Counts of how frequently a document is cited, downloaded, linked to, or otherwise used are postpublication indicators particularly suited to online environments.  None of the postpublication methods are as widely accepted as prepublication review, however." (Borgman 59-60)

"Peer review is itself a subject of study and periodic conferences.  It is a social process, with all the attendant flaws.... Calls for reform have accelerated for two reasons: the availability of new means to evaluate digital documents, and the use of peer-review mechanisms for unintended purposes." (Borgman 60)

"The use of a publication forum as a proxy measure for the quality of research productivity has distorted the peer-review system so severely that some consider it 'broken'." (Borgman 60)

"Among the many aspects of peer review being debated are the value of confidentiality, the degree of fairness and objectivity, and the ability of the process to detect inaccuracies and fraud." (Borgman 61)

"Open review has the advantage of speeding and democratizing reviewing, and could result in better manuscripts being submitted." (Borgman 61)

"Open posting and ranking, whether conducted pre- or postpublication, raises question of 'who is a peer?'" (Borgman 61)

"Another concern about complete open peer review is whether readers will trust the results or be willing to read through all the reviews to make their own assessments.  Prepublication mechanisms serve as expert filters on what becomes part of the scholarly record, winnowing out the researchers' reading list" (Borgman 62)

"Reviewing can be a conservative process that is more likely to reinforce the norms of a field than to identify significant breakthroughs." (Borgman 62)

"Despite the many problems with peer review, publication indicators are used to evaluate scholars for hiring, promotion, funding, and other rewards.  Whether appropriate or not, outputs of the system in the form of data, documents, and publications are easier to measure than are inputs such as scholars' time, education, reading of scholarly literature, and research activities in their laboratories and libraries." (Borgman 63)

"it is essential to distinguish clearly between quality of scholarship and the use of indicators such as the publication forum and citation counts as proxies for quality." (Borgman 63)

"The limits of bibliometric and webometric indicators for quality control are well-known.  Weaknesses include the ability to fame the system by heavily citing one's own work or that of colleagues, and methodological difficulties in interpreting meanings of references, assigning weights to multiauthored papers, aggregating work distributed over multiple papers, and determining the time period to cover." (Borgman 64)

"The influence of book reviews in the assessment of scholars is particularly problematic given how disconnected they are form the peer-review process." (Borgman 65)

"New technologies did not result in shifting the balance among stakeholders as radically or rapidly as some had hoped, largely because social practices are much more enduring than are technologies." (Borgman 65)

"The functions of scholarly communication can be grouped into three categories: legitimization; dissemination; and access, preservation, and curation." (Borgman 66)

"Historically, access, preservation, and curation have not been the responsibility of authors but rather of librarians and archivists.  Authors have begun to assume some of these responsibilities by posting their own work on personal Web pages.  However, personal Web pages are much more effective for dissemination than for preservation functions." (Borgman 69)

"Documents in a scholarly communication system are nodes in a network.  Each scholarly document builds, implicitly or explicitly, on those that came before." (Borgman 70)

"Scholarly communication is best understood as a sociotechnical system, with a complex set of interactions among processes, structures, functions, and technologies.  The system is difficult to comprehend as a whole, due to the many methods, theories, variables, and levels of analysis applied.  Yet efforts to restructure scholarly communication must be based on an understanding of the structures and processes involved." (Borgman 73)

5.  The Discontinuity of Scholarly Publishing

"Shifts in intellectual property policy, the economics of scholarly publishing, and relationships between stakeholders have contributed to systemic restructuring." (Borgman 75)

"Proposals for reform range from a comprehensive reorganization of the scholarly communication system to better ways of accomplishing the current functions." (Borgman 75)

"the supposed low barriers to entry in a computer-based publishing system ignore the complex relationships between stakeholders.  'Self-publishing' is an oxymoron in the scholarly world.  Authors need peer reviewers; publishers need authors, editors, and reviewers; and libraries need content to collect, organize, make accessible, and preserve." (Borgman 76)

"Changes in scholarly publishing can be attributed partly to the 'pull' of new technologies and partly to the 'push' of institutional restructuring." (Borgman 76)

"By the latter 1990s, the traditional library model of journal subscriptions and book purchasing was deemed economically unsustainable." (Borgman 77)

of print:  "Copies tend to be distributed widely, often internationally.  It is nearly impossible to locate and destroy all extant copies of a printed publication once it is disseminated, which assists its long-term preservation." (Borgman 78)

"Digital documents are not fixed; they are malleable, mutable, and mobile.  Only one master version exists, and it can be altered, destroyed, or become unreadable, either deliberately or through benign neglect." (Borgman 78)

"Despite the act that digital publications can be held to the same standards of peer review and authentication as print publications, many scholars remain suspicious." (Borgman 78)

"being published by a recognized source registers the printed document in the scholarly communication system so that it can become part of the community discourse." (Borgman 80)

"University hiring, tenure, and promotion processes have depended heavily on the quality control provided by publishers of printed scholarly works.  Review committees consider not only what a scholar has published but also where." (Borgman 81)

"In this flood of online material, publication status often is unclear.  The same or similar content can exist concurrently in multiple forms." (Borgman 82)

"Tensions between ease of access and the desire to control that access are leading to complex interactions between the functions of the scholarly communication system." (Borgman 82-83)

"As research crosses more organizational and disciplinary boundaries, it is more difficult to apply singular standards for evidence, quality, value, or 'truth'." (Borgman 83)

"Most of the quality criteria applied in the peer-review process still require human judgment, such as the significance of the work, while some criteria such as statistical accuracy and originality can be augmented by technical methods of verification." (Borgman 84)

"The simplest approach to clarifying the legitimacy of digital documents is to rely on traditional quality indicators such as the imprimatur of well-regarded publishers.  This approach, however, cedes much of the control for legitimization to publishers and discourages experimental forms of publication." (Borgman 84)

"the usual counterargument to a reliance on publication indicators as proxies for the quality of scholarship is to encourage review committees to read publications closely enough to make their own judgments." (Borgman 85)

"In a print world, publication in a journal registers the document in the scholarly communication system, establishes the dates for priority of claims, and certifies that the article passed through a peer-review process.  In a digital world, it is possible to accomplish these aspects of the legitimacy function independently."  (Borgman 85)

"Libraries are collecting manuscripts, data sets, digitized images and texts, and other artifacts of scholarly communication into institutional repositories.  They also are cataloging some public online items, thereby making them a virtual part of their collections.  By these activities, libraries are legitimizing some forms of scholarly content that are outside the scope of traditional publishing." (Borgman 87)

"Access depends on the ability to discover and retrieve documents of interests, and then follow a trail through the scholarly record." (Borgman 88)

"Preservation can be a passive process, while curation is an active one." (Borgman 88)

"Until recently, most metadata were ignored by search engines, despite the massive investments of libraries and publishers in describing the contents and subject matter of scholarly books and journals.  Metadata were ignored because they are so easily and commonly misrepresented on the World Wide Web.  Web sites manipulate their metadata in hopes of increasing their rankings, while search engines adjust their algorithms to maintain some objective standards of relevance." (Borgman 90)

"Documents are easier to discover, retrieve, and verify if they are described with appropriate metadata.  Cataloging and indexing, however, are expensive endeavors." (Borgman 91)

"Scholars follow trails through the literature to trace the origins of an idea and relationships among prior works.... In digital environments, each relationship can be represented by a link to another object.  If intellectual relationships can be represented by links, scholarly discourse will be enhanced." (Borgman 92)

"The print model does not transfer well to the digital world.  For reliable retrieval, links must originate from, and point to, the unique original rather than a copy.... The identifier must be unique, so that the links to and from the object are unambiguous.  It must be persistent, so that the link can be followed over long periods of time, during which the object might be moved to a different computer or even a different format (e.g., migrating to later versions of software)." (Borgman 93)

"Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) have been adopted by major publishers to identify individual journal articles and other publications in digital form." (Borgman 94)

"DOIs, in turn, are an implementation of the Corporation for National Research Initiatives's Handle System.  Handles are designed to be stable identifiers, and are less likely to break than are URLs." (Borgman 94)

"Preservation is an expensive, long-term commitment.  Files must be mounted, computers must be maintained, software must be updated, data must be backed up and migrated, and people must be paid -- even if no new data are added to the database.  The two parts of the digital curation problem, as identified by Nentwich (2003) -- what will be archived, and who will take responsibility? -- are deeply intertwined." (Borgman 95)

"Libraries typically license access to journals in digital form, with content remaining in publisher databases.  These licenses prevent or limit libraries' abilities to preserve this content, even if they were willing to absorb the cost of doing so." (Borgman 96)

"Mass digitization raises technology and information policy issues such as copyright, the quality of digital representation and authentication, long-term preservation responsibility, standards and interoperability, and business models for libraries, publishers, and book-sellers." (Borgman 96)

"Preserving access to the scholarly record is a growing public policy concern.  Many in the academic community are reluctant to assign responsibility for the scholarly record to commercial entities, whether publishers or search engines." (Borgman 96)

"Book preservation and access are even greater concerns than for journals, due to the vital role that books play in cultural heritage." (Borgman 97)

"In the present disarray, it is difficult to distinguish the long-term restructuring  of scholarly publishing from short-term developments." (Borgman 97)

"Issues of what constitutes a 'publication,' the open access movement, intellectual property, and economics each have deep roots and long-term implications for scholarly publishing." (Borgman 97)

"The act of publishing a physical artifact has three important characteristics, none of which may be true for a digital publication:  'It is public, it is irrevocable, and it provides a fixed copy of the work.'" (Borgman 98, citing _Digital Dilemma_ 42)

"Scholarship progresses by discussion, transparency, and accountability, all of which require that scholarly works are widely and readily available." (Borgman 101)

"One of the primary motivations for open access is to make scholarly publication immediately and widely available, thereby enhancing authors' visibility.  The claim that papers in open access repositories would be more highly cited than those in publisher databases alone has been confirmed by several studies" (Borgman 101)

"Despite the potential for increased visibility of one's published work, self-archiving has been vastly less successful than predicted by open access advocates.... Outside of physics and computer science, the voluntary deposit rates average about 15 percent." (Borgman 102)

"institutional repositories arose in response to two strategic issues facing universities: to reform scholarly communication by disaggregating the functions of publishing, and to provide 'tangible indicators of an insitution's quality'" (Borgman 102)

"Research funding agencies, both public and private, have yet another set of incentives for open access to publications.  Repositories offer a mechanism to ensure that the research they fund is disseminated and accessible." (Borgman 103)

"Publishers initially viewed most forms of open access as a substantial threat.  As open access gained momentum, publishers began to experiment with forms that offered new revenue streams such as author fees, dual mode, delayed, partial, and per capita.... Publishers are finding that self-archiving increases the visibility of journals and does not necessarily diminish subscription revenue.  Open access to the full content of books, such as that provided by the National Academy Press, can increase book sales" (Borgman 103)

"What is at stake in open access to scholarly content, according to Clifford Lynch (2006), is a 'fundamental reconceptualization' of the use of scholarly literature and scholarly evidence." (Borgman 104)

"Intellectual property is an umbrella term that incorporates copyright, patents, and trademarks.  In the context of scholarly publishing, the most contentious issues are copyright, digital rights management, fair use, orphan works, the public domain, and the 'information commons'." (Borgman 105)

"The public domain has become much smaller due to the expansion in the scope of material that can be copyrighted and the extension of the copyright term's length." (Borgman 106)

"Orphan works are those for which copyright owners cannot be identified or contacted to obtain permission for use." (Borgman 108)

"An information commons is not the same as the public domain... Owners of 'common use materials' can protect their collective use rights.... Creative Commons licenses give owners ways to make their creative works available while controlling how those works are used." (Borgman 109-10)

"Although often commodified and treated as property, information has different characteristics than hard good such as furniture or real property (Lessig 2004).  These characteristics of information make it difficult to price.  Most of the costs involved in producing information are intellectual.  The first copy is expensive; subsequent reproduction and distribution are relatively inexpensive.  For these reasons, most business models for information are based on demand rather than production costs" (Borgman 110)

"University administrators often complain that they are paying twice to acquire publications: once for the salary of their faculty members who did the research, and a second time to buy their scholarly products back from the publishers." (Borgman 111)

"Business models for book publishing may follow the leased bundles models of journals.  Libraries and individuals could subscribe to digital books, much as they subscribe to movies with Netflix.  Rather than borrow or purchase individual titles, they may have access to a fixed number of titles at a time, or 'check books out' for a fixed period of time.  These models raise a host of questions about relationships among publishers, libraries, and readers with regard to the privacy of reading habits, the continuity of access, preservation, and censorship." (Borgman 113)

"Much is at stake in the business models and policies for access to digital books.  Books carry many of the 'big ideas' of a culture.  We hand books down to subsequent generations.  Receiving a subscription to a digital library is much different than inheriting physical artifacts that have been read, annotated, and contemplated by generations before." (Borgman 114)

6.  Data:  Input and Output of Scholarship

"Data sets are becoming an end product of research, supplementing the traditional role of scholarly publications.... If related data and documents can be linked together in a scholarly information infrastructure, creative new forms of data- and information-intensive, distributed, collaborative, multidisciplinary research and learning become possible." (Borgman 115)

"The infrastructure of scholarly publishing bridges disciplines: every field produces journal articles, conference papers, and books, albeit in differing ratios.  Libraries select, collect, organize, and make accessible publications of all types, from all fields.  No comparable infrastructure exists for data." (Borgman 115)

"Data visualization and data-mining tools are used to identify and interpret patterns, from the environmental sciences to art history." (Borgman 117)

"Data 'mashups,' analogous to mashups of music and images, are used to weave together data from multiple sources or to plot many types of data on to a common map" (Borgman 117)

"When publications were viewed as the sole end product of scholarship, few incentives existed to curate data for use by other researchers." (Borgman 118)

"Data are much less 'self-describing' than are journal articles and other text-based communication.  Documenting data accurately for curatorial and sharing purposes depends more heavily on metadata and standards for data structures.  Getting individuals, teams, and communities to agree on standards for data description cuts to the very core of the theory, method, instruments, and paradigms of a field, all of which change continuously." (Borgman 129)

"the use of data varies so much across disciplines that only general commonalities can be identified.  Each field has its empiricists who collect data and its theoreticians who rely on data gathered by others.  Each field also has its own practices for determining acceptable choices of data, and ways in which those data are analyzed or interpreted." (Borgman 130)

issues of legitimization, dissemination, and preservation/curation of data

"The cost per use is one metric to determine whether and how long to curate the data.  This metric is problematic because it favors popular collections and may not weight temporal factors adequately." (Borgman 141)

issues of access to data, incl. copyright, public domain, etc.

7.  Building an Infrastructure for Information

"The risks in constructing grand technological infrastructures lie in assuming that 'if we build it, they will come.'... Scholars do adopt new technologies when they see sufficient advantage in doing so, but they adapt them to their needs.  Thus, to determine what infrastructure tools and services will be most useful, it is necessary to understand who the users are and how they conduct their research." (Borgman 149)

"From an information perspective, the interesting differences between disciplines include research methods, such as empirical, analytic, or interpretative (Meadows 1998), and 'knowledge territories' such as basic characteristics (method, or pure or applied orientation), shared theories or ideologies, common techniques, and sociocultural characteristics (e.g., the people-to-problem ratio, frequency and form of publication, or incidence of collaborative work) (Becher 1989)." (Borgman 150)

"Individual scholars self-identify with their fields more than with their universities, seeing their departments as local chapters of national and international enterprises." (Borgman 151) -- this might suggest that the institutional repository is in some sense a misguided effort, and that we might be best served by focusing on the production of association- or field-based repositories

"Digital libraries are a canonical form of boundary object, because their contents can be useful to multiple communities, allowing them to carry meaning across the borders of multiple groups." (Borgman 153)

"Changes in scholarly practices such as mining data sets can have significant influences on scholars' professional identity.  Shifts in technology and funding that favor computational methods may disadvantage those whose research is based on fieldwork, for instance." (Borgman 153)

breakdown of different scholarly practices with respect to: the seeking and use of information, the artifacts of scholarly communication, the construction of knowledge, and collaboration

"Scholars seem to be even more dependent on library services for access to scholarly publications than in the past.  Personal subscriptions to journals have declined substantially." (Borgman 156)

"Reading habits are also changing.  Scholars are reading more articles now than they were a decade or two earlier, as evidenced by longitudinal studies of reading behavior.  They are not spending more time reading; they appear to be spending less time per article." (Borgman 156)

"The sciences have the longest runs of journals online.  Scientists read and publish in journals more than in books, and they rely on more recent literature than do other disciplines.  Therefore, scientists are the most advantaged in accessing the relevant publications for their research.  Humanists and social scientists are relatively disadvantaged, having shorter runs of their journals online, and relying on books in addition to journals, and drawing on older literature." (Borgman 159)

"Scholarly artifacts such as publications often are treated as objective commodities that can be counted as indicators of productivity." (Borgman 160)

on the reproduction in digital form of the print mode of scholarly publications:  "The stability of these forms reflects scholarly practices rather than a rejection of technological capabilities per se.  Particularly counterintuitive is the fact that existing forms do not necessarily serve scholars well, yet new genres that take advantage of the malleable, mutable, and mobile nature of digital objects have been slow to emerge." (Borgman 160)

"Print formats and their emulations hinder scholarly reading practices.  Behavioral studies reveal that people skim titles, abstracts, and sometimes conclusions to determine whether to read the full article." (Borgman 161)

"Book readers also skim and skip around, only rarely reading entire monographs from beginning to end." (Borgman 161)

"scholars are not making extensive use of the sophisticated tools for search refinement or reading that do exist, mostly because of apparent mismatches between the tools and their interests.... The failures of early technologies may have discouraged subsequent designers of electronic publishing tools, but clearly it is time to revisit the implications of these practices for the design of scholarly information infrastructure." (Borgman 161)

"Scholars do not share all of their information, all of the time.  Even in effective collaborations, scholars are unlikely to take the Three Musketeers' pledge of 'all for one, and one for all.' More often, the are 'flying in formation, for as long as the relationship is fruitful,' as one senior scientist put it." (Borgman 169)

"Information technologies can aid or hinder collaboration." (Borgman 169)

"Scholars compete for funding, jobs, students, publication venues, awards, priority of findings, and authority.  The scholarly incentive structure rewards those who are the most competitive.  But scholars also collaborate to gather the expertise necessary to study complex problems, share scare or expensive equipment, and to share data and other information resources" (Borgman 169)

"Studies in the United States and the United Kingdom found that faculty are more interested in simply ways to manage their own publications than in open access as a public service to the community.  Functions that facilitate the personal use of publications such as generating reports for departmental and personnel reviews are greater incentives to contribute than are benefits such as improved metadata." (Borgman 173)

8.  Disciplines, Documents, and Data

"The nature of artifacts, the associated practices, and the incentives for scholars to contribute their work to the content layer are assessed first for the sciences, then the social sciences, and lastly the humanities." (Borgman 179)

"The first, and often greatest, barrier to sharing is that scholars are rewarded for publication rather than for document and data management.  Hiring, tenure, promotions, grants, and other aspects of the academic reward structure are based on producing peer-reviewed publications." (Borgman 196)

"Humanists are leading many standards efforts for encoding text, images, and art objects." (Borgman 218)

"In the humanities, it is difficult to separate artifacts from practices or publications from data.  The library is their laboratory, as the old aphorism goes." (Borgman 219)

"Humanistic scholarship tends to be more individualistic than in other disciplines.  As Blaise Cronin (2005, 25) puts it, publishing in the humanities 'assumes *a* work written by *an* author.'  Reading a sole-authored book or article in these fields is a conversation with the author.  The humanities are at the opposite extreme from the sciences, where 'collective cognition' is valued.  They have the lowest rates of coauthorship and collaboration of the disciplines, with the higher rates of collaboration occurring in digital projects.  E-Research is expecrted to promote collaboration in the humanities, due to the size of projects and the range of expertise required." (Borgman 219-20)

digital humanities work often produces digital libraries

"The other general category of digital humanities products consists of assemblages of digitized cultural objects with associated analyses and interpretations.  These are the equivalent of digital books in that they present an integrated research story, but they are much more, as they often include interactive components and direct links to the original sources on which the scholarship is based." (Borgman 220)

in the humanities, "the view still prevails that technology is not a necessary tool for research.  Risk taking, particularly in the use of technology-based scholarship, rarely is rewarded in tenure and promotion." (Borgman 222-23)

"Scholars continue to rely on the publishing system to guarantee that the products of their work are legitimized, disseminated, preserved, curated, and made accessible.  Despite its unstable state, the system does exist, resting on relationships among libraries, publishers, universities, scholars, students, and other stakeholders." (Borgman 225)

9.  The View from Here

"the real value in information infrastructure is in the information.  Building the content layer of that infrastructure is both the greatest challenge and the greatest potential payoff of these programs.  Only when the content layer is robust can data mining and other services succeed."  (Borgman 227)

"notions of fixity are problematic in a digital, distributed, world.  Fixity will remain important for evidentiary purposes, such as the value chain in scholarship.  It must remain possible to cite publications, data, and other sources in persistent ways, so that others can evaluated the evidence on which a scholarly work rests.  Dynamic objects, however, will be increasingly common in scholarly work." (Borgman 232)

"While the fundamental purposes of scholarly publishing -- to legitimize, disseminate, access, and curate scholarly work -- have remained relatively constant over several centuries, the means to accomplish these purposes have changed radically in less than two decades.... The business models of the publishing industry have changed radically in this time period.  What was a 'gentleman's profession' became a global industry marked by mergers, acquisitions, and market consolidation."

"Universities are caught in a maelstrom of changing business models, public policies, scholarly practices, and technologies." (Borgman 237)

"The conservatism of the reward system fosters continuity by making scholars less vulnerable to the whims of fashion or of individual administrators.  The conservatism in the process, however, also reinforces the norms of earlier eras, making scholars reluctant to take risks on new venues for disseminating their work." (Borgman 239)

"Universities have more carrots than sticks to use in altering faculty behavior.  Change will occur most quickly when faculty are rewarded for experimenting with new forms of publishing such as open access and new scholarly products such as digital object and data.  Universities and higher education agencies risk undermining their efforts to reform scholarly communication if they merely reinforce the norms that serve print publication and that preserve the disciplinary boundaries of the past." (Borgman 240)

"While some advocates of open access would welcome the demise of scholarly publishers, publishers do add value, and a scholarly communication system without their participation is no more sustainable than is the subscription model." (Borgman 243)

"We must be careful to allow social norms to operate and change over time and circumstances, lest we embed a narrow, current, and ethnocentric trust framework into the information infrastructure." (Borgman 261)

"Incentives to collaborate and to share are always balanced with those to compete and to protect one's sources and ideas.  Technology will now change these social characteristics.  Nevertheless, technology and policy together can encourage either cooperation or competition.  Building tools to share data will not cause people to share, but tools that simplify capturing and sharing data, in combination with policies that reward scholars for doing so, are likely to change behavior." (Borgman 262)
