"the e-waste problem will soon reach such gigantic proportions that it will overwhelm our shipping capacity. The world simply cannot produce enough containers for America to continue at its current level as an exporter of both electronic goods and electronic waste" (3)

"Deliberate obsolescence in all its forms—technological, psychological, or planned—is a uniquely American invention... we invented the very concept of disposability itself, as a necessary precursor to our rejection of tradition and our promotion of progress and change" (3)

"Planned obsolescence is the catch-all phrase used to describe the assortment of techniques used to artificially limit the durability of a manufactured good in order to stimulate repetitive consumption" (5)

"Long before mass production became a universally accepted term in the 1950s, American businessmen worried about over-production and how to avoid it—not by producing less but by selling more." (9)

the problem of overproduction in the early 20th c was both a problem of demand (how to stimulate it) and distribution (how to move stuff to consumers)

"The central marketing question of the early twentieth century was how could a manufacturer encourage consumers to return to his product again and again, instead of buying the wares of his competitor?" (10)

branding, packaging, disposability

campaigns against thrift: "As a throwaway culture emerged, the ethic of durability, of thrift, of what the consumer historian Susan Strasser calls 'the stewardship of objects,' was slowly modified. At first, people just threw their paper products into the fire. But as the disposable trend continued, it became culturally permissible to throw away objects that could not simply and conveniently be consumed by flames." (24)

traces origins of deliberate product obsolescence to competition between Ford and GM in 1920s

"In manufacturing terms, psychological obsolescence was superior to technological obsolescence, because it was considerably cheaper to create and could be produced on demand" (36)

in this competition, "style" emerged as "the newest and most important selling feature of the day" (49)

"Manipulationist theories of consumption are not as popular among sociologists today as they once were, but few would deny that psychological obsolescence was a strategy designed to put the consumer into a state of anxiety based on the belief that whatever old is undesirable, dysfunctional, and embarrassing, compared with what is new." (50)

"Every Sunday for over fifty years, the New York Times bestseller listing has encouraged the repetitive consumption of books by surveying what is in and out of fashion." (55)

"progressive obsolescence" seen as a means of sustaining US economic growth

"So much of the world was then in transition, as new things constantly replaced old ones, and so many old values were coming into conflict with new ones -- perhaps this helps explain why 'obsolescence' became such an expressive and powerful concept during the late 1920s and 1930s. In their everyday lives, ordinary people were becoming familiar with the need to discard not just consumer goods but ideas and habits that had suddenly bec(o)me obsolete." (62)

technocracy: "The basic ideas of the movement were that new technologies had thrown capitalist America into a depression and that the price system had outlived its usefulness, because it empowered businessmen and politicians whose interest in maximizing profit was incompatible with the promise of a technological society. The crisis of the Depression required that society be restructured by engineers and economists around the principle of production for the use and prosperity of the many, rather than the profit of the few." (70-71)

notion of "planned obsolescence" similarly emerging from need to place society under expert control; term probably coined by Bernard London, Manhattan real estate broker, who published a 20-age pamphlet entitled Ending the Depression through Planned Obsolescence in 1932; proposed the establishment of a government body that would declare official lifespans for consumer goods, after which time they would be declared "dead" and new ones purchased

planned obsolescence more commonly associated with "death dating," artificially controlling the lifespan of a product through adulteration or other means; see GE's lightbulbs (80)

"all the elements of what would become known as planned obsolescence or death dating were clearly in place by 1932. These include the connection between adulteration and repetitive consumption, the term 'planned obsolescence' itself, and scientific research into various structural means for limiting a product's life span" (81)

obsolescence, radio, and television, esp surrounding David Sarnoff

"When the Senate asked Sarnoff how he intended to protect RCA customers against the danger of obsolescence in his television sets, since many features of television had not yet been firmly established and might change radically and often, Sarnoff replied that 'we have as much interest as anyone in protecting the public. We serve the public. They are our customers. If we disappoint them we shall not have the business. But if this new philosophy of obsolescence means protecting the people, then we have to go and learn our economics all over again in this country…'" (98)

"By the 1950s, product life spans were no longer left to chance but were created by plan, and it is at this moment (from about 1957 on) that the phrase planned obsolescence acquired the additional meaning of 'death dating.' Eventually, death dating would become the primary meaning of the phrase." (113)

the role of wartime products in increased disposability

Brooks Stevens: "Our whole economy is based on planned obsolescence and everybody who can read without moving his lips should know it by now. We make good products, we induce people to buy them, and then next year we deliberately introduce something that will make those products old fashioned, out of date, obsolete. We do that for the soundest reason: to make money." (153)

"Just after the Edsel's appearance, the Soviets launched Sputnik I. More than any other mid-century event, this was a tipping point, after which America began a period of introspection that challenged the consumer ethic of waste. Prior to that time, Americans for the most part had been happy to participate in consumerism because they had a vested interest in believing what they had been told: that the wastefulness of planned obsolescence fueled a competitive research economy which guaranteed them a position on the cutting edge of technology." (156)

Sputnik "challenged head-on two of the most basic premises of American ideology: technological superiority and the economic prosperity it supposedly fostered." (156)

Vance Packard, The Hidden Persuaders: "examined the claim that scientific advertising (then called motivational research) was essential to America's economic health. The book's claim that American consumers' 'buying habits were directly controlled through subliminal techniques' formed the basis of a perspective on consumerism that would come to be called manipulationism." (159)

"where the Hidden Persuaders had implicated only advertisers, manufacturers, and marketers, The Waste Makers placed responsibility for waste on the consuming public itself" (161)

"Thanks to Packard in the late 1950s, planned obsolescence came to have the same negative connotations that the earlier term, adulteration, had had in the previous century." (163)

on the Volkswagen advertising campaigns: "In this way, Madison Avenue cleverly made the values of the counterculture accessible and acceptable to middle America, and then pressed them into the service of consumerism." (176)

"Although Moore's Law was intended to emphasize the increasing power and the diminishing costs of integrated circuits, it also provided an index to the steady rate of technological obsolescence created by ICs. In 1965 chips were doubling their capacity and lowering their price every year, so it did not take very long at all to render obsolete any given chip or the power, compactness, and cost of the device that used it. In other words, any electronic device that contained a microchip was death-dated by the time it left the assembly line. These devices were truly self-consuming artifacts, since their desirability diminished automatically." (196)

"Technological obsolescence -- the same market force that Walter Dorwin Teague had approvingly referred to as 'natural obsolescence' in 1960 -- was driving the repetitive consumption of a variety of new products that now included digital watches, calculators, computers, and computer software. By 1965 the ground was prepared for America's e-waste crisis. The earliest e-waste produce that contained a microchip was the disposable electronic calculator." (198)

"by the 1980s, what younger engineers perceived as a democratization of calculation had in fact sheared the engineering world along generational lines. Age, not wealth, determined which engineers had the advantage. As the hacker culture would soon demonstrate, design and engineering were no longer the exclusive activities of a carefully trained elite. The term 'obsolete' now applied both to the device that the older generation of administrators preferred and to the analog skills they used." (203-204)

cell phones and e-waste

"The increasingly short life span of high-volume electronic goods, along with miniaturization, is what causes the e-waste problem. This lack of durability, in turn, grows from a unique combination of psychological and technological obsolescence." (262)

"the actions and habits of America's consumers threaten to flood the world with toxins, just as surely as do the misguided priorities of multinational corporations. Now more than ever, end-users of new technology need to pursue higher levels of technological literacy in order to negotiate the complex interactions among technology, society, and the environment" (263)

Colin Campbell on "neophilia"

"'Recycling' is a word with unexamined positive connotations for most Americans, but 'recycling' can obscure a host of ills. Until very recently, e-waste has move surreptitiously and illegally from North American stockpiles to countries in the developing world." (279)

"We now live in a complicated world where our consumption of technology must include routine safeguards, and where naive or unconscious consumption of technology is no longer a healthy option." (280)

"Very soon, the sheer volume of e-waste will compel America to adopt design strategies that include not just planned obsolescence but planned disassembly and reuse as part of the product life cycle." (281)
