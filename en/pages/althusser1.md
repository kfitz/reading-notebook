Althusser, Louis.  “Contradiction and Overdetermination.” In For Marx.  trans. Ben Brewster.  New York: Pantheon, 1969.  87-128.


issues of multiple causality/determination — causality determined not merely by “single” effects of infrastructure (economic base) but by “multiple” effects of superstructure (RSA and ISAs)

inverting Hegel; finding rational inside mystical (rational kernel/mystical shell)

Marxist concept of contradiction

Lenin and the “weakest link” — revolution possible in Russia because Russia was weak link in chain of imperialist nations; weakness as product of historical contradictions

contradictions alone cannot induce a revolution (or ensure its success)

complexity of the Marxist-Leninist contradiction v. simplicity of Hegelian contradiction (ideology!)

complexity of contradiction — historically situated (ideal v. real)

Hegel explains material via consciousness; Marx considers material for itself, thinks of consciousness as deriving from material

in Marx, economic reality is product of deeper reality — mode of production

for Marx, State is not “reality of the Idea” but an instrument supporting mode of production

new Marxian concept: social class (as connected to relations of production)

overdetermination: “the accumulation of effective determinations (deriving from the superstructures and from special national and international circumstances) on the determination in the last instance by the economic” (113)
