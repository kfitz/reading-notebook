Hyde, Lewis. The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World. Vintage, 2007. E-book.

**Preface**

“when it first came out the book was in fact an embodiment of the problem it addresses. Books that are hard to explain may, one hopes, be more useful in the long run, but they are also the harder to commodify for a ten-second sell.” (9/343)

“the West has undergone a period of remarkable market triumphalism. We’ve witnessed the steady conversion into private property of the art and ideas that earlier generations thought belonged to their cultural commons, and we’ve seen the commodification of things that a few years ago would have seemed beyond the reach of any market.” (10/343)

**Introduction**

“It is the assumption of this book that a work of art is a gift, not a commodity. Or, to state the modern case with more precision, that works of art exist simultaneously in two ‘economies,’ a market economy and a gift economy. Only one of these is essential, however: a work of art can survive without the market, but where there is no gift there is no art.” (11/343)

“a gift is a thing we do not get by our own efforts. We cannot buy it; we cannot acquire it through an act of will. It is bestowed upon us.” (11/343)

“It a work of art is the emanation of its maker’s gift and if it is received by its audience as a gift, then is it, too, a gift? I have framed the question to imply an affirmative answer, but I doubt we can be so categorical. Any object, any item of commerce, becomes one kind of property or another depending on how we use it. Even if a work of art contains the spirit of the artist’s gift, it does not follow that the work itself is a gift. It is what we make of it.” (12-13/343)

“if it is true that in the essential commerce of art a gift is carried by the work from the artist to his audience, if I am right to say that where there is no gift there is no art, then it may be possible to destroy a work of art by converting it into a pure commodity.” (13/343)

“every modern artist who has chosen to labor with a gift must sooner or later wonder how he or she is to survive in a society dominated by market exchange. And if the fruits of a gift are gifts themselves, how is the artist to nourish himself, spiritually as well as materially, in an age whose values are market values and whose commerce consists almost exclusively in the purchase and sale of commodities?” (13/343)

“The mythology of a market society” makes it so that “getting rather than giving is the mark of a substantial person, and the hero is ‘self-possessed,’ ‘self-made.’ So long as these assumptions rule, a disquieting sense of triviality, of worthlessness even, will nag the man or woman who labors in the service of a gift and whose products are not adequately described as commodities.” (14/343)

“Moreover... a gift that cannot be given away ceases to be a gift.” (14/343)

Marcel Mauss’s “Essai sur le don” notes “for one thing, that gift economies tend to be marked by three related obligations: the obligation to give, the obligation to accept, and the obligation to reciprocate.” (15/343)

“The first half of this book is a theory of gift exchange and the second is an attempt to apply the language of that theory to the life of the artist.” (16/343)

“I am not concerned with gifts given in spite or fear, nor those gifts we accept out of servility or obligation; my concern is the gift we long for, the gift that, when it comes, speaks commandingly to the soul and irresistibly moves us.” (17/343)

### Part I: A Theory of Gifts

**Chapter One: Some Food We Could Not Eat**

“a cardinal property of the gift: whatever we have been given is supposed to be given away again, not kept.” (21/343)

“A gift that cannot move loses its gift properties.... If we think of the gift as a constantly flowing river, we may say that the girl in the tale who treats it correctly does so by allowing herself to become a channel for its current.” (24/343)

“Another way to describe the motion of the gift is to say that a gift must always be used up, consumed, eaten. _The gift is property that perishes_.” (25/343)

“a gift is consumed when it moves from one hand to another with no assurance of anything in return.” (26/343)

“In commodity exchange it’s as if the buyer and the seller were both in plastic bags; there’s none of the contact of a gift exchange.... Consumer goods are consumed by their owners, not by their exchange.” (26/343)

“The gift not only moves, it moves in a circle.” (28/343)

“When the gift moves in a circle its motion is beyond the control of the personal ego, and so each bearer must be a part of the group and each donation is an act of social faith.” (33/343)

“Each of us identifies with a wider and wider community as we mature, coming eventually to think and act with a group-ego.... Of course the larger it becomes, the less it feels like what we usually mean by ego. Not entirely, though: whether an adolescent is thinking of himself or a nation of itself, it still feels like egotism to anyone who is not included...
   If the ego widens still further, however, it really does change its nature and become something we would no longer call ego.” (34/343)

“The ego’s firmness has its virtues, but at some point we seek the slow dilation, to use another term of Whitman’s, in which the ego enjoys a widening give-and-take with the world and is finally abandoned in ripeness.” (34/343)

“one of ecology’s first lessons was that, beneath all the change in nature, there are steady states characterized by cycles.... When we see that we are actors in natural cycles, we understand that what nature gives to us is influenced by what we give to nature.” (36/343)

“Now that we have seen the figure of the circle we can understand what seems at first to be a paradox of gift exchange: when the gift is used, it is not used up. Quite the opposite, in fact: the gift that is not used will be lost, while the one that is passed along remains abundant.” (38/343)

“Gifts are a class of property whose value lies only in their use and which literally cease to exist as gifts if they are not constantly consumed.” (38/343)

“Scarcity and abundance have as much to do with the form of exchange as with how much material wealth is at hand. Scarcity appears when wealth cannot flow.” (39/343)

“Under assumptions of exchange trade, property is plagued by entropy and wealth can become scarce even as it increases.” (40/343)

“Our generosity may leave us empty, but our emptiness then pulls gently at the whole until the thing in motion returns to replenish us.” (41/343)

**Chapter Two: The Bones of the Dead**

“invariably either the bearers of the gift or the gift itself grows as a result of its circulation” (44/343)

“even when a gift is not alive it is treated as if it were, and whatever we treat as living beings to take on life” (44/343)

“where we have established such a relationship we tend to respond to nature as a part of ourselves, not as a stranger or alien available for exploitation. Gift exchange brings with it, therefore, a built-in check upon the destruction of its objects; with it we will not destroy nature’s renewable wealth except where we also consciously destroy ourselves.” (46/343)

“two terms for ‘life’ in Greek, _bios_ and _zoë_. _Bios_ is limited life, characterized life, life that dies. _Zoë_ is the life that endures; it is the thread that runs through _bios-life_ and is not broken when the particular perishes” (51/343)

“The growth is in the sentiment; it can’t be put on the scale.” (53/343)

“Thus the gift becomes an agent of social cohesion, and this again leads to the feeling that its passage increases its worth, for in social life, at least, the whole really is greater than the sum of its parts.” (54/343)

“Capital earns profit and the sale of a commodity turns a profit, but gifts that remain gifts do not _earn_ profit, they _give_ increase. The distinction lies in what we might call the vector of the increase: in gift exchange it, the increase, stays in motion and follows the object, while in commodity exchange it stays behind as profit.” (55/343)

“a circulation of gifts nourishes those parts of our spirit that are not entirely personal, parts that derive from nature, the group, the race, or the gods.” (56/343)

“where, on the one hand, there is no way to assert identity against the mass, and no opportunity for private gain, we lose the well-advertised benefits of a market society — its particular freedoms, its particular kind of innovation, its individual and material variety, and so on. But where, on the other hand, the market alone rules, and particularly where its benefits derive from the conversion of gift property to commodities, the fruits of gift exchange are lost.” (57/343)

“Capitalism is the ideology that asks that we remove surplus wealth from circulation and lay it aside to produce more wealth. To move away from capitalism is not to change the form of ownership from the few to the many, but to cease turning so much surplus into capital, that is, to treat most increase as a gift. It is quite possible to have the state own everything and still convert all gifts to capital, as Stalin demonstrated.” (fn59/343)

**Chapter Three: The Labor of Gratitude**

“‘threshold gifts,’ gifts that mark the passage from one place or state into another” (60/343)

“A man who would buy and sell at a moment of change is one who cannot or will not give up, and if the passage is inevitable, he will be torn apart. He will become one of the done-for dead who truly die. Threshold gifts protect us from such death.” (63/343)

“just as gifts are linked to the death that moves toward new life, so, for those who believe in transformation (either in this life or in another), ideologies of market exchange have become associated with the death that goes nowhere. George Romero, the man who made the movie _The Dawn of the Dead_, set his film in a shopping mall near Pittsburgh; the parking lots and aisles of discount stores may be where the restless dead of a commodity civilization will tread out their numberless days.” (64/343)

HOLY SHIT — Hyde uses AA as an example of the gift that “may be the actual agent of change, the bearer of new life” (64/343)

on AA as a voluntary organization whose services are provided free and which operates on member contributions: “the charging of fees for service tends to cut off the motivating force of gratitude, a source of AA’s energy” (65/343)

“The twelfth step is an act of gratitude: recovered alcoholics help other alcoholics when called upon to do so. It is a step in which the gift is passed along, so it is right that it should be the final one.” (65/343)

“A lively culture will have transformative gifts as a general feature — it will have groups like AA which address specific problems, it will have methods of passing knowledge from the old to the young, it will have spiritual teachings available at all levels of maturation and for the birth of the spiritual self. And it will have artists whose creations are gifts for the transformation of the race.” (66/343)

“In each example I have offered of a transformative gift, if the teaching begins to ‘take,’ the recipient feels gratitude. I would like to speak of gratitude as a labor undertaken by the soul to effect the transformation after a gift has been received. Between the time a gift comes to us and the time we pass it along, we suffer gratitude. Moreover, with gifts that are agents of change, it is only when the gift has worked in us, only when we have come up to its level, as it were, that we can give it away again.” (66/343)

“a transformative gift cannot be fully received when it is first offered because the person does not yet have the power either to accept the gift or to pass it along.” (68/343)

“Once a gift has stirred within us it is up to us to develop it. There is a reciprocal labor in the maturation of a talent. The gift will continue to discharge its energy so long as we attend to it in return.” (68/343)

“A gift isn’t fully realized until it is given away, then. Those who will not acknowledge gratitude or who refuse to labor in its service neither free their gifts nor really come to possess them.” (69/343)

distinction between work (intentional, paid, by-the-hour activity) versus labor (more difficult to quantify in all regards): “Work is an intended activity that is accomplished through the will. A labor can be intended but only to the extent of doing the groundwork, or of _not_ doing things that would clearly prevent the labor.” (69/343)

“In ancient days a seventh part of a person’s time (both Sunday and the sabbatical, the seventh year) were set aside for nonwork. Nowadays when a worker or teacher gets a sabbatical, he or she may try to finish six years of unfinished chores. But first he should put his feet up and see what happens.” (70/343)

“One of the first problems the modern world faced with the rise of industrialism was the exclusion of labor by the expansion of work.” (70/343)

“Gratitude requires an _unpaid_ debt, and we will be motivated to proceed only so long as the debt is _felt_. If we stop feeling indebted we quit, and rightly so.... A prepaid fee suspends the weight of the gift and depotentiates it as an agent of change.” (71/343)

“An abiding sense of gratitude moves a person to labor in the service of his _daemon_. The opposite is properly called narcissism. The narcissist feels his gifts come from himself. He works to display himself, not to suffer change.” (72/343)

“There is no technology, no time-saving device that can alter the rhythms of creative labor. When the worth of labor is expressed in terms of exchange value, therefore, creativity is automatically devalued every time there is an advance in the technology of work.” (fn 76/343)

**Chapter Four: The Bond**

“It is the cardinal difference between gift and commodity exchange that a gift establishes a feeling-bond between two people, while the sale of a commodity leaves no necessary connection.” (77/343) — The same might be said of the difference between one’s relationship to a collaborator and a service-provider; is the other person providing _labor_ or _work_ on the project, in Hyde’s sense?

“a commodity has value and a gift does not. A gift has worth.” (81/343)

“We do not deal in commodities when we wish to initiate or preserve ties of affection.... Situations calling for gifts are exactly those in which we find inappropriate the detachment of analytic deliberation.” (87/343)

“Because of the bonding power of gifts and the detached nature of commodity exchange, gifts have become associated with community and with being obliged to others, while commodities are associated with alienation and freedom.” (88/343)

“In this old lovers’ quarrel between liberty and community, Westerners are those who defend freedom and long for attachment.” (89/343)

“there is a kind of servitude associated with gifts of transformation. We are indentured to our gifts until they come to term. But this is a willing bondage, and the bond is loosened with the maturation of the gift.” (91/343)

“Because gifts do have the power to join people together, there are many gifts that must be refused. On the simplest level, we are wary of gifts in any situation that calls for reckoning and discrimination.... A gift, no matter how well-intentioned, deflects objective judgment.” (92/343)

“It is because gift exchange _is_ an erotic form that so many gifts must be refused.... when we refuse relationship, we refuse gift exchange as well.” (94/343)

**Chapter Five: The Gift Community**

“If we take the synthetic power of gifts, which establish and maintain the bonds of affection between friends, lovers, and comrades, and if we add to these a circulation wider than a binary give-and-take, we shall soon derive society, or at least those societies — family, guild, fraternity, sorority, band, community — that cohere through faithfulness and gratitude.” (96/343)

“There’s no simple moral because there’s no simple way to resolve the conflict between community and individual advancement, a conflict that accounts for so much of our political and ethical life.” (98/343)

“In order to proceed within the terms of our wider argument, we will need to ask not just how scientific community emerges and endures, but specifically what happens to it when scientific knowledge circulates as a gift, and what happens when knowledge is treated as a commodity, for sale at a profit.” (98/343)

“Scientists who give their ideas to the community receive recognition and status in return... ‘one reason why the publication of texts tends to be a despised form of scientific communication [is that] the textbook author appropriates community property for his personal profit.’” (99/343)

“I am not saying science _is_ a community that treats ideas as contributions; I am saying it becomes one _to the degree_ that ideas move as gifts.” (101/343)

“Where status is bestowed according to the contribution of original ideas, a thief may survive for a while, but in the long run someone smells a rat, notoriety replaces prestige, ill repute replaces esteem, and the crook is out in the cold.” (101/343)

“several reasons why ideas might be treated as gifts, the first being that the task of assembling a mass of disparate facts into a coherent whole clearly lies beyond the powers of a single mind or even a single generation. All such broad undertakings call for a community of scholars, one in which each individual thinker can be awash in the ideas of his comrades so that a sort of ‘group mind’ develops, one that is capable of cognitive tasks beyond the powers of any single person.” (102/343)

“A scientist may conduct his research in solitude, but he cannot do it in isolation. The ends of science require coordination. Each individual’s work must ‘fit,’ and the synthetic nature of gift exchange makes it an appropriate medium for this integration; it is not just people that must be brought together but the ideas themselves.” (102/343)

“a circulation of gifts can produce and maintain a coherent community, or, inversely, ... the conversion of gifts to commodities can fragment or destroy such a group. To convert an idea into a commodity means, broadly speaking, to establish a boundary of some sort so that the idea cannot move from person to person without a toll or a fee.” (102/343)

“Ideas do not circulate freely when they are treated as commodities.” (104/343)

“Where there is a marked competition for jobs and money, when such supposedly secondary goals become primary, more and more scientists will be pulled into the race to hurry ‘original’ work into print, no matter how extraneous to the wider goals of the community.” (104/343)

“There is competition in science, of course, as well as gift exchange, and there is individualism as well as teamwork. But I think it right to begin, as Hagstrom does, with the emergence of community through the circulation of knowledge as a gift. _After_ community has appeared, we may speak of dissent, segmentation, differentiation, dispute, and all the other nuances of intellectual life. But it would be difficult to work in the other direction — to begin with ideas exchanged in a way that stressed particularity, individuality, and personal profit — and then move toward a coordination of effort and a harmony of theory.... as long as the goals of science require an intellectual community congenial to discourse and capable of integrating a coherent body of theory, gift exchange will be a part of its commerce.” (105/343)

“Gifts are best described, I think, as anarchist property.” (106/343)

“gift exchange is an economy of small groups... It remains an unsolved dilemma of the modern world, one to which anarchists have repeatedly addressed themselves, as to how we are to preserve true community in a mass society, one whose dominant value is exchange value and whose morality has been codified into law.” (110-11/343)

“There are many connections between anarchist theory and gift exchange as an economy — both assume that man is generous, or at least cooperative, ‘in nature’; both shun centralized power; both are best fitted to small groups and loose federations; both rely on contracts of the heart over codified contract, and so on. But, above all, it seems correct to speak of the gift as anarchist property because both anarchism and gift exchange share the assumption that it is not when a part of the self is inhibited and restrained, but when a part of the self is given away, that community appears.” (113/343)

**Chapter Six: A Female Property**

“Transactions that involve life itself seem to constitute the primary case in which we feel called upon to distinguish the right of bestowal from the right of sale.” (118/343)

“The woman who is given in marriage similarly takes on typical functions of the gift. She, too, establishes a bond (between clans or families), and as part of an ongoing system of kinship, she, like any gift, becomes an agent of the community’s cohesion and stability.” (121/343)

“This last is what is onerous to us in the idea that a woman may be given in marriage — not, I think, that people are sometimes treated as gifts, not even that there is such a thing as ‘the right of bestowal in persons,’ but that that right passes to the son when he comes of age, but not to the daughter.” (124/343)

“A woman given in marriage in a modern, capitalist nation is not only a gift, then, she is actually expected to think and act in the spirit of the gift, to become the incarnation and voice of the _hau_. By attending to relationship and muting her individualism, she is supposed to become the active link that will unify the two families. The groom is asked to do none of this labor.” (125/343)

“As gifts are agents of relationship, so brides become relations, literally, by the form of commerce assigned to them; but in the market, in a male commerce, relationship is a secondary concern.” (126/343)

“To make the wider point here, what we take to be the female professions — child care, social work, nursing, the creation and care of culture, the ministry, teaching (these last, when done by men, being done by effete men, as Vice President Spiro Agnew told us) — all contain a greater admixture of gift labor than male professions — banking, law, management, sales, and so on. Furthermore, the female professions do not pay as well as the male professions.” (128/343)

“We must therefore distinguish the necessary feminist demand for ‘equal pay for equal work’ from the equally important need to keep some parts of our social, cultural, and spiritual life out of the marketplace. We must not convert all gift labors into market work lest we wake one day to see that universal market in which all our actions earn a wage and all our goods and services bear a price.” (129/343) — Oy. Too late.

“In a modern, capitalist nation, to labor with gifts (and to treat them as gifts, rather than exploit them) remains a mark of the female gender.” (130/343)

**Chapter Seven: Usury: A History of Gift Exchange**

“Several senses of ‘usury’ precede the modern one. The term took on its current meaning (an excessive or illegal rate of interest) during the Reformation. Before that it simply means _any_ interest charged on a loan, and its opposite was a form of gift, the gratuitous loan.” (134/343)

“The idea of usury therefore appears when spiritual, moral, and economic life begin to be separated from one another, probably at the time when foreign trade, exchange with strangers, begins... when foreign trade begins, the tendency is to differentiate the material increase from the social and spiritual increase, and a commercial language appears to articulate the difference.” (135/343)

“The God who permits usury [in exchange with strangers] is one who allows gift exchange to have a boundary.” (138/343)

“If we make a list of the ways in which medieval churchmen sought to reconcile the Gospel with the old permission to usure, we will find that most resolve the apparent conflict by finding fault with the Jew; nowhere does there appear the idea of a wandering tribe protecting itself.” (141/343)

“It is always the ideal: one does not take usury from a brother and all men should be brothers.
The Reformation changed this.” (143/343)

“The leaders of the Reformation still spoke of brotherhood, but they had become convinced that brotherhood could not be the basis of civil society.” (143-44/343)

“A group of people comes to be called a brotherhood not only when the circulation of gifts assures that no one has lost touch with the sources of wealth, but also when no individuals in the group can make a private living by standing in the stream where surplus wealth flows toward need.” (148/343)

“after the sixteenth century one begins to feel that the spirit of charity itself demands that capital be let out at interest.” (156/343)

“market relationships and capital let out at interest do not bear the increase-of-the-whole that gift exchange will bear. Equitable trade is not an agent of transformation, nor of spiritual and social cohesion.” (160/343)

“Such charity is not a gift. The recipient of a gift should, sooner or later, be able to give it away again. If the gift does not really raise him to the level of the group, then it’s just a decoy, providing him with his daily bread while across town someone is buying up the bakery.” (161/343)

### Part II: Two Experiments in Gift Aesthetics

**Chapter Eight: The Commerce of the Creative Spirit**

“it has been my hope from the outset that the ethnography, fairy tales, and anecdotes of the first half of this book could be read as parables or Just So stories of the creative spirit” (168/343)

“An essential portion of any artist’s labor is not creation so much as invocation. Part of the work cannot be made, it must be received; and we cannot have this gift except, perhaps, by supplication, by courting, by creating within ourselves that ‘begging bowl’ to which the gift is drawn.” (168/343)

“All artists work to acquire and perfect the tools of their craft, and all art involves evaluation, clarification, and revision. But these are secondary tasks. They cannot begin (sometimes they must not begin) until the _materia_, the body of the work, is on the page or on the canvas.... Premature evaluation cuts off the flow.” (170/343)

“The fruit of the creative spirit is the work of art itself, and if there is a first-fruits ritual for artists, it must either be the willing ‘waste’ of art (in which one is happy to labor all day with no hope of production, nothing to sell, nothing to show off, just fish thrown back into the sea as soon as they are caught) or else, when there is a product, it must be this thing we have already seen, the dedication of the work back toward its origins.” (173/343)

“The hegemony of the market can undermine the possibility of gift exchange, the esemplastic powers can be destroyed by an overvaluation of analytic cognition, song can be silenced by self-consciousness, and the plenitude of the imagination can be lost to the scarcity of logic.” (181/343)

“The destruction of the spirit of the gift is nothing new or particular to capitalism. All cultures and all artists have felt the tension between gift exchange and the market, between the self-forgetfulness of art and the self-aggrandizements of the merchant, and how that tension is to be resolved has been a subject of debate since before Aristotle.” (183/343)

**Chapter Nine: A Draft of Whitman**

“As gift exchange is an erotic commerce, joining self and other, so the gifted state is an erotic state: in it we are sensible of, and participate in, the underlying unity of things.” (190/343)

“Cash exchange is to gift exchange what reason is to enthusiasm.” (196/343)

“When it identifies with ‘the grass over graves,’ therefore, the self assumes an identity harmonious with its own process in the gifted state. The self that identifies with a cycle of gifts takes its own activity as its identity — not the reception of objects, not the bestowal of particular contents, but the entire process, the respiration, the give-and-take of sympathy and pride.” (207/343)

“All of this vegetable sex — these trees and leaves of grass — carries in it, cometimes, the disappointment of an animal desire.” (237/376)

"where, exactly, the gift lies in the creation of a work of art.... The initial gift is what is bestowed upon the self -- by perception, experience, intuition, imagination, a dream, a vision, or by another work of art.... The ability to do the labor is the second gift... The artist makes something higher than what he has been given, and this, the finished work, is the third gift, the one offered to the world in general or directed back specifically to the 'clan and homeland' of an earlier gift." (239-240/376)

**Chapter Ten: Ezra Pound and the Fate of Vegetable Money**

"the role of willpower in art" (277/376)

"The will does not create the 'germinating image' of a work, nor does it give the work its form, but it does provide the energy and the directed attention called for by a dialogue with the imagination." (278/376)

"Said Eliot to Pound, 'I asked you to write an article which would explain this subject to people who had never heard it; yet you write as if your readers knew about it already, but had failed to understand it." (280/376)

"Goodwill can fight bd will, but only in those cases where will is called for in the first place." (286/376)

"when the will works in isolation, it turns of necessity to dictionary studies, syntactical tricks, intellectual formulae, memory, history, and convention -- any source of material, that is, which can imitate the fuits of imagination without actually allowing them to emerge.... The will knows about survival and endurance; it can direct attnetion and energy; it can finish things. But we cannot remember a tune or a dream on willpower. We cannot stay awake on willpower. Will may direct *virtù* but it cannot bring it into the world. The will by itself cannot heal the soul. And it cannot create." (286/376)

"Yeats sensed in Pound's politics the same tension we addressed in the poetry: a will to power born of a frustrated compassion begins to acquire a life of its own and live apart from that compassion." (301/376)

**Conclusion**

"It has been the implication of much of this book that there is an irreconcilable conflict between gift exchange and the market, and that, as a consequence, the artist in the modern world must suffer a constant tension between the gift sphere to which his work pertains and the market society which is his context.... My position has changed somewhat. I still believe that the primary commerce of art is a gift exchange, that unless the work is the realization of the artist's gift and unless we, the audience, can feel the gift it carries, there is no art; I still believe that a gift can be destroyed by the marketplace. But I no longer feel the poles of this dichotomy to be so strongly opposed." (337/376)

"One of the lessons of Pound's life, certainly, is that there is little to be gained by a wholesale attach on the market. We can sometimes limit the scope of its influence, but we cannot change its nature." (337/376)

"The boundary can be permeable. Gift-increase (unreckoned, positive reciprocity) may be converted into market-increase (reckoned, negative reciprocity). And vice versa: the interest that a stranger pays on a loan may be brought into the center and converted into gifts." (338/376)

"The problem is not 'Can gift and commodity coexist?' but 'To what degree may one draw from the other without destroying it?'" (338/376)

"there are three primary ways in which modern artists have resolved the problem of their livelihood: they have taken second jobs, they have found patrons to support them, or they have managed to place the work itself on the market and pay the rent with fees and royalties." (339/376)

"Someone, somewhere sold his labor in the marketplace, or grew rich in finance, or exploited the abundance of nature, and the patron turns that wealth into a gift to feed the gifted." (340/376)

"In a land that feels no reciprocity toward nature, in an age in which the rich imagine themselves to be self-made, we should not be surprised to find the interior poverty of the gifted state replicated in the actual poverty of the gifted." (345/376)

"To feel the love of people whom we love is a fire that feeds our life. But to feel the affection that comes from those whom we do not know, from those unknown to us, who are watching over our sleep and solitude, over our dangers and our weaknesses -- that is something still greater and more beautiful because it widens out the boundaries of our being, and unites all living things." (quoting Neruda, 347/376)

**On Being Good Ancestors**

"there are categories of human enterprise that are not well organized or supported by market forces. Family life, religious life, public service, pure science, and of course much artistic practice: none of these operates very well when framed simply in terms of exchange value... any community that values these things will find nonmarket ways to organize them." (348/376)
