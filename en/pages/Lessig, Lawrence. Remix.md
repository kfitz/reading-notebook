Lessig, Lawrence. Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy. New York: Penguin Press, 2008.


Lessig begins his exploration in Remix with a point that he first raised in 2004's Free Culture:  if we are going to declare a "war on piracy," we need to be prepared for collateral damage.  In Free Culture, the collateral damage that Lessig explored was the traditional culture of the United States, with its modes of open exchange of cultural materials (libraries distributing books, for instance, as well as teenagers making mix tapes) and its reliance on a growing public domain to spur increasing creativity.  In Remix, the collateral damage Lessig writes about is a bit more personal: our children.  "How," Lessig asks, is the war on piracy "changing how they think about normal, right-thinking behavior?  What does it mean to society when a whole generation is raised as criminals?" (xix).  Are we willing to sacrifice a generation to fight this war, or might we consider, in fact, that the costs of this war are too high, and that some other means of attaining its objectives might be sought?

"It is time we stop developing tools that do nothing more than break the extraordinary connectivity and efficiency of this network." (Lessig xxi)

"It does no one any good to regulate in ways that we know people will not obey." (Lessig xxii)

quoting Candice Breitz:  "No artist works in a vacuum.  Every artist reflects -- consciously or not -- on what has come before and what is happening parallel to his or her practice." (qtd on Lessig 8)

Gregg Gillis/GirlTalk:  "And incidentally, Gillis believes, it is also good for the record industry: 'From a financial perspective, this is how the music industry can thrive in the future -- ...this interactivity with the albums.  Treat it more like a game and less like a product." (Lessig 15)

"for SilviaO, the act of creating had changed.  Before, she sat in a studio, crafting work that would be broadcast, one to many.  Now she was in a conversation with other artists, providing content they would add to, and adding content back." (Lessig 17)

"Collateral damage is the focus of this book.  I want to put a spotlight on the stuff no one wants to kill -- the most interesting, the very best of what these new technologies make possible.  If the war simply ended tomorrow, what forms of creativity could we expect?  What good could we realize, and encourage, and learn from? // I also want to spotlight the damage we're not thinking enough about -- the harm to a generation from rendering criminal what comes naturally to them.  What does it do to them?  What do they then do to us?" (Lessig 18)

Sousa's testimony that mechanically reproduced music would eliminate the culture of amateur musicianship has borne out:  "These 'machines,' Sousa feared, would lead us away from what elsewhere he praised as 'amateur' culture.  We would become just consumers of culture, not also producers.  We would become practiced in selecting what we wanted to hear, but not practiced in producing stuff for others to hear." (Lessig 25)

anti-democratic effects of such mechanical reproduction:  "fewer and fewer would have access to instruments, or the capacity, to create or add to the culture around them; more and more would simply consume what had been created elsewhere.  Culture would become the product of an elite, even if this elite, this cultural monarchy, was still beloved by the people." (Lessig 25)

"Amateurism, to this professional, was a virtue -- not because it produced great music, but because it produced a musical culture: a love for, and an appreciation of, the music he re-created, a respect for the music he played, and hence a connection to a democratic culture." (Lessig 27)

read/write (RW) culture versus read-only (RO) culture

"The twentieth century was the first time in the history of human culture when popular culture had become professionalized, and when the people were taught to defer to the professional." (Lessig 29)

importance of limitations on the reach of copyright in encouraging amateur/RW culture

"the future could see the emergence of a form of economic enterprise that has been relatively rare in our past, but that promises extraordinary economic opportunity:  what I call the 'hybrid'" (Lessig 34)

"while of course the stuff was not born with the 'infernal machines' that Sousa lamented (in our tradition it was Gutenberg who gave birth to the most significant spread of tokens of RO culture), my focus for the moment will be on the RO culture that Sousa did lament: the tokens of RO culture that get processed and performed by machines, capturing and spreading music, and the spoken word, and eventually, images and film" (Lessig 36) -- interesting potential connections to Benjamin here...

"The law supported this business model [of RO analog material media distribution].  The law, for example, forbade a consumer from making ten thousand copies of his favorite LP to share with his friends.  But it wasn't really the law that mattered most in stopping this form of 'piracy.' It was the economics of making a copy in the world of analog technology." (Lessig 38)

"Digital technology then changed 'nature.' With the introduction of digital tokens of RO culture and, more important, with the widespread availability of technologies that could manipulate digital tokens of RO culture, digital technology removed the constraints that had bound culture to particular analog tokens of RO culture." (Lessig 38)

"What before was impossible and illegal is now just illegal." (Lessig 38)

iTunes and the spread of digital culture

"If the twentieth century made culture generally accessible, the twenty-first will make it universally accessible." (Lessig 42)

"The idea that the library gets to say when and what I read is outrageous.  Or put differently, it would have been considered outrageous for any library or bookstore or publisher to exercise the same control over access to books that television stations and film distributors exercised over film and video." (Lessig 43-44)

"Freedom will mean freedom to choose to watch what you want when you want, just as freedom to read means the freedom to read what you want when you want.  In both cases, not necessarily *for free*.  But in both cases, according to your schedule, not the schedule of someone else." (Lessig 44)

"Even the good become pirates in a world where the rules seem absurd." (Lessig 44)

"Though this instinct can't be justified as a matter of (at least today's) law, it is the essence of practical reason in the digital age:  if you don't want your stuff stolen, make it easily available." (Lessig 46)

"just as the limitations of analog RO culture were eliminated by digital technologies, so too the limitations of twentieth-century advertising can be eliminated by twenty-first-century digital technology.  And as the lessons of this change get spread, content providers will increasingly recognize that free access pays.  Free access is a means to gather extremely valuable data about the viewer.  That data can translate into much more effective advertising techniques." (Lessig 48)

"the most important policy mistake is one that stifles the Sousarian instinct: a policy driven by the view that the only way to protect RO culture is to render RW culture illegal.  That choice is a false choice." (Lessig 50)

on a friend's extensive use of quotations in his writing, as well as the use of precedents in legal writing:  "In both instances, of course, citation is required.  But the cite is always sufficient payment.  And no one who writes for a living actually believes that any permission beyond that simple payment should ever be required." (Lessig 52)

"Writing, in the traditional sense of words placed on paper, is the ultimate form of democratic creativity, where, again, 'democratic' doesn't mean people vote, but instead means that everyone within a society has access to the means to write." (Lessig 52-53)

"Though I've not yet found anyone who can quite express why, any qualified Hollywood lawyer would tell you there's a fundamental difference between quoting Hemingway and quoting Sam Wood's version of Hemingway." (Lessig 53)

suggestion that the difference lies in the democratic nature of writing (everyone can, and so everyone should have the ability to quote the work of others) and the previously elite nature of media production:  "But what happens when writing with film (or music, or images, or every other form of 'professional speech' from the twentieth century) becomes as democratic as writing with text?" (Lessig 54)

"remix is an essential act of RW creativity." (Lessig 56)

"The Web's inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, was keen that the Web be an RW medium -- what Benkler calls 'the writable Web.'  He pushed people developing tools to implement Web protocols to design their tools in a way that would encourage both reading and writing." (Lessig 58)

blogs as first successful layer of the RW web; followed by folksonomies like del.icio.us and indexes like Technorati

"All this openness is the product of a kind of democracy made real with writing.  If trends continue, we're about to see this democracy made real with all writing.  The publishers are going to fight the Googlezation of books.  But as authors see that the most significant writing is that which is RW, they'll begin to insist that their publishers relax." (Lessig 67-68)

"There are two goods that remix creates, at least for us, or for our kids, at least now.  One is the good of community.  The other is education." (Lessig 77)

kids learn how to create media through remix

"This is not to say, of course, that however they do this remix, they're doing something good.  There's good and bad remix, as there's good and bad writing.  But as bad writing is not an argument against writing, bad remix is not an argument against remix.  Instead, in both cases, poor work is an argument for better education." (Lessig 81)

ties of remix to older forms of participatory culture

"If in 1968 you wanted to capture the latest Walter Cronkite news program and remix it with the Beatles, and then share it with your ten thousand best friends, what blocked you was not the law.  What blocked you was that the production costs alone would have been in the tens of thousands of dollars." (Lessig 83)

different values of RO/professional culture and RW/pro-am culture

"This then is the first difference between RO and RW cultures.  One emphasizes learning.  The other emphasizes learning by speaking.  One preserves its integrity.  The other teaches integrity.  One emphasizes a hierarchy.  The other hides the hierarchy.  No one would argue we need less of the first, RO culture.  Buy anyone who has seen it believes we need much more of the second." (Lessig 87-88)

"The law's relationship to RW culture is different.  For again, the very act of rewriting in a digital context produces a copy; that copy triggers the law of copyright.  Once triggered, the law requires either a license or a valid claim of 'fair use.' Licenses are scarce; defending a claim of 'fair use' is expensive.  By default, RW use violates copyright law.  RW culture is thus presumptively illegal." (Lessig 100)

two economies:  commercial and sharing; interpenetration is often awkward and unpleasant

three factors that make new internet businesses successful: long tail, little brother, apis

"I have described a distinction between commercial and sharing economies.  But obviously, there's no reason these two economies can't coexist.  Indeed, commercial and sharing economies often complement each other.... Only a fanatic would advocate wiping away one economy simply because of its effect on the other." (Lessig 150)

"I will call 'thin sharing economies' those economies where the motivation is primarily me-regarding; 'thick sharing economies' are economies where the motivations are at least ambiguous between me and thee motivation." (Lessig 152)

various projects built through sharing economies:  Linux, Apache, Project Gutenberg, etc., up through Wikipedia

"we need to remember that a large part of the motivation for contributing to these sharing economies comes from people just doing for themselves what they want to do anyway." (Lessig 173)

hybrid economy is "either a commercial entity that aims to leverage value from a sharing economy, or it is a sharing economy that builds a commercial entity to better support its sharing aims.  Either way, the hybrid links two simpler, or purer, economies, and produces something from the link. // That link is sustained, however, only if the distinction between the two economies is preserved." (Lessig 177)

example of hybrid: companies selling particular Linux systems (Red Hat, Ubuntu); community spaces (craigslist, flickr, youtube); collaboration spaces (slashdot, last.fm); communities (second life)

"media companies, as well as businesses more generally, are recognizing that closer ties with the audience are the key to profit in the era of the hybrid" (Lessig 212)

"You create value by giving people what they want; you create good by designing what you're offering so that people getting what they want also give something back to the community.  No one builds hybrids on community sacrifice." (Lessig 224)

"It is hard for many to see how a 'culture of generosity' can coexist with an ethic of profit.  The slogan 'You be generous, and I make money' seems like a nonstarter." (Lessig 233)

sharecropping: in which the corporation permits or facilitates certain kinds of remix, and then claims all property rights over the result

"A hybrid that respects the rights of the creator -- both the original creator and the remixer -- is more likely to survive than one that doesn't." (Lessig 246-47)

need for copyright reform in order that both RO and RW culture can flourish:  deregulate amateur creativity; clear title; simplify; decriminalizing the copy; decriminalizing file sharing

"For most of the history of copyright in America (186 out of almost 220 years, to be precise), copyright was an opt-in system of regulation.  You got the benefit of copyright protection only if you asked for it." (Lessig 262)

"Copyright law has got to give up its obsession with 'the copy.'  The law should now regulate 'copies' or 'reproductions' on their own.  It should instead regulate uses -- like public distributions of copies of copyrighted work -- that connect directly to the economic incentive copyright law was intended to foster." (Lessig 268)

"An academic publishing a paper wants nothing more than people to copy and read her paper.  But the law says no copying without permission." (Lessig 276)

"The parent who beats his child with a two-by-four because the child didn't clean his room is not wrong to insist his child clean his room.  His is wrong because however right the motive, his means are always subject to measure." (Lessig 287)

"The simple reason we wage a hopeless war against our kids is that they have less money to give to political campaigns than Hollywood does." (Lessig 294)
