# Barth, John.  "The Literature of Exhaustion."  *Atlantic* 220 (August 1967): 29-34.


article primarily on Borges, but also "some professional concerns of my own" (Barth 29) -- concerns = anxieties?

"exhaustion" not metaphysical or decadent, but "the used-upness of certain forms or exhaustion of certain possibilities" (Barth 29) -- Barth does not connect this exhaustion to the media, but rather to a sense that it's all already been said

"art and its forms and techniques live in history and certainly do change.  I sympathize with a remark attributed to Saul Bellow, that to be technically up to date is the least important attribute of a writer, though I would have to add that this least important attribute may be nevertheless essential" (Barth 30)

Barth claims that in an era of "felt ultimacies" -- including "the celebrated dehumanization of society" -- the best writing "reflects and deals with ultimacy, both technically and thematically" (Barth 30)

on Borges's "Pierre Menard":  his theme is "the difficulty, perhaps the unnecessity, of writing original works of literature.  His artistic victory, if you like, is that he confronts an intellectual dead end and employs it against itself to accomplish new human work" (Barth 31) -- Borges as the "strong writer," confronting the anxiety of obsolescence and overcoming it

"Suppose you're a writer by vocation -- a 'print-oriented bastard,' as the McLuhanites call us -- and you feel, for example, that the novel, if not narrative literature generally, if not the printed word altogether, has by this hour of the world just about shot its bolt, as Leslie Fieldler and other maintain.  (I'm inclined to agree, with certain reservations and hedges.  Literary forms certainly have histories and historical contingencies, and it may well be that the novel's time as a major art form is up, as the 'times' of classical tragedy, grand opera, or the sonnet sequence came to be.  No necessary cause for alarm in this at all, except perhaps to certain novelists, and one way to handle such a feeling might be to write a novel about it...)" (Barth 32)

"Whether historically the novel expires or persists seems immaterial to me; if enough writers and critics *feel* apocalyptical about it, their feeling becomes a considerable cultural fact" (Barth 32)

Barth refers to himself and his work as "novels which imitate the form of the Novel, by an author who imitates the role of Author" (Barth 33)
