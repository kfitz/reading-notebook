Collins, Jim. “Reading, in a Digital Archive of One’s Own.” PMLA 128.1 (2013): 207–212. doi://10.1632/pmla.2013.128.1.207.

"it’s clear from the assumptions that underpin the end-is-near pronouncements about the e-book that there’s reading and then there’s reading and that when people talk about the future of reading, they’re worried about whether readers worthy of the name will continue reading literary fiction in the twenty-first century. But that isn’t a very interesting question because it imagines the act of reading in such an ahistorical manner, curled up in a well-upholstered time warp, far from the unruliness of contemporary reading cultures." (207)

"Reading is no longer a uniquely solitary practice—it is alternately solitary and social" (208)

"Personal libraries have been around for centuries, and the idea that we are a product of our libraries has been part of the humanist education project all along" (208)

interested in the ways "we are encouraged to think of ourselves as built of the digital libraries we assemble in a culture defined by the database" (209)

contra Manovich: "are database and narrative really natural enemies? The database as file depot may be nonnarrative, but our negotiation of it is endlessly narrativized as we download iles into our personal archives, at which point the files are transformed into curated articulations of personal taste—you are your playlist, not your database" (209)

"That we can take libraries with us and immerse ourselves in those digital rooms of our own whenever we’re so inclined makes curating into a form of self-constitution" (209)

on Carr/Shirky & the battle over reading: "Both sides in this polarized situation commit the same error—or, more precisely, the same omission. Carr and Shirky define literary reading solely in technological terms, and neither demonstrates much interest in how reading technologies are embedded in cultural formations" (210)

"The debate between the defenders of traditional literary experience and the celebrants of digital culture has created a discursive roadblock that we can clear away only by identifying and disentangling the discrete aspects of a literary reading" (210)

"The media historian Lisa Gitelman argues that while a medium is a technology that enables communication, it also depends on 'protocols,' the social and cultural practices that determine the functions and values the medium might take on over time" (210)

Jenkins builds on Gitelman and draws a distinction between a "medium" and a "delivery system"; we are accustomed to thinking of the book as a medium, but through Jenkins "we could argue that the shift from wood pulp to e-reader is a change in delivery system" (210)

huge anxieties derive, for Collins, from the conflation of cultural experience, medium, and delivery system: "Change the object that is the book, and suddenly attention spans shorten, long-form narrative shrinks into sound bites, deep reading is no longer necessary, and literature departments are obsolete. According to this scenario, reading literary fiction on an e-reader is a gateway drug that leads to the hard stuff of digital culture—become psychologically dependent on that e-reader, and you’ll find yourself in an alley somewhere with a cell-phone novel written by promiscuous Japanese teenagers sticking out of your arm" (210); must disentangle to see how long-form narrative has actually evolved

"if we fail to consider the implications of the e-reader as the personal archive of the reader- curator, then what we talk about when we talk about reading will remain an exercise in nostalgia, grounded in a discourse of inevitable loss that ignores what reading already is" (212)

"To appreciate the force of media convergence, which makes anyone holding a portable device a reader-viewer-listener, we have to pay even closer attention to the factors that shape cultural divergence—the ways reading, viewing, and listening are invested with value and why, in the midst of an excess of access, certain forms of expression are still valorized by media conglomerates and devoted fans" (212)
