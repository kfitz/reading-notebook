# Barthes, Roland. Empire of Signs. trans. Richard Howard. New York: Hill and Wang, 1982.


"The text does not 'gloss' the images, which do not 'illustrate' the text.  For me, each has been no more than the onset of a kind of visual uncertainty, analogous perhaps to that *loss of meaning* Zen calls a *satori*.  Text and image, interlacing, seek to ensure the circulation and exchange of these signifiers: body, face, writing; and in them to read the retreat of signs." (Barthes xi)

## Faraway

treatment of Japan as fictive:  "Hence Orient and Occident cannot be taken here as 'realities' to be compared and contrasted historically, philosophically, culturally, politically.  I am not lovingly gazing toward an Oriental essence -- to me the Orient is a matter of indifference, merely providing a reserve of features whose manipulation -- whose invented interplay -- allows me to 'entertain' the idea of an unheard-of symbolic system, one altogether detached from our own." (Barthes 3)

"Someday we must write the history of our own obscurity -- manifest the destiny of our narcissism, tally down through the centuries the several appeals to difference we may have occasionally heard, the ideological recuperation which have infallibly followed and which consist in always acclimating our incognizance of Asia by means of certain known languages..." (Barthes 4)

"The author has never, in any sense, photographed Japan.  Rather, he has done the opposite: Japan has starred him with any number of 'flashes'; or, better still, Japan has afforded him a situation of writing.  This situation is the very one in which a certain disturbance of the person occurs, a subversion of earlier readings, a shock of meaning lacerated, extenuated to the point of its irreplaceable void, without the object's ever ceasing to be significant, desirable.  Writing is after all, in its way, a *satori*: *satori* (the Zen occurrence) is a more or less powerful (though in no way formal) seism which causes knowledge, or the subject, to vacillate: it creates *an emptiness of language*.  And it is also an emptiness of language which constitutes writing; it is from this emptiness that derive the features with which Zen, in the exemption from all meaning, writes gardens, gestures, houses, flower arrangements, faces, violence." (Barthes 4)

## The Unknown Language

"The dream:  to know a foreign (alien) language and yet not to understand it... in a word, to descend into the untranslatable" (Barthes 6)

"Thus, in Japanese, the proliferation of functional suffixes and the complexity of enclitics suppose that the subject advances into utterance through certain precautions, repetitions, delays, and insistances whose final volume (we can no longer speak of a simple line of words) turns the subject, precisely, into a great envelope empty of speech..." (Barthes 7)

"how can we *imagine* a verb which is simultaneously without subject, without attribute, and yet transitive, such as for instance an act of knowledge without knowing subject and without known object?" (Barthes 7)

## Without Words

"The murmuring mass of an unknown language constitutes a delicious protection, envelops the foreigner (provided the country is not hostile to him) in an auditory film which halts at his ears all the alienations of the mother tongue: the regional and social origins of whoever is speaking, his degree of culture, of intelligence, of taste, the image by which he constitutes himself as a person and which he asks you to recognize.  Hence, in foreign countries, what a respite!  Here I am protected against stupidity, vulgarity, vanity, worldliness, nationality, normality.  The unknown language, of which I nonetheless grasp the respiration, the emotive aeration, in a word the pure significance, forms around me, as I move, a faint vertigo, sweeping me into its artificial emptiness, which is consummated only for me: I live in the interstice, delivered from any fulfilled meaning." (Barthes 9)

"Now it happens that in this country (Japan) the empire of signifiers is so immense, so in excess of speech, that the exchange of signs remains of a fascinating richness, mobility, and subtlety, despite the opacity of the language..." (Barthes 9)

## Water and Flake

"the entire *praxis* of alimentation being in the composition, by composing your choices, you yourself make what it is you eat; the dish is no longer a reified product..." (Barthes 12)

"writing is precisely that act which unites in the same labor what could not be apprehended together in the mere flat space of representation" (Barthes 14)

## Chopsticks

"In all these functions, in all the gestures they imply, chopsticks are the converse of our knife (and of its predatory substitute, the fork): they are the alimentary instrument which refuses to cut, to pierce, to mutilate, to trip... by chopsticks, food becomes no longer a prey to which one does violence (meat, flesh over which one does battle) but a substance harmoniously transferred..." (Barthes 18)

## Food Decentered

"no Japanese dish is endowed with a *center* (the alimentary center implied in the West by the rite which consists of arranging the meal, of surrounding or covering the article of food); here everything is the ornament of another ornament" (Barthes 22)

"*sukiyaki*, an interminable dish to make, to consume, and, one might say, to 'converse,' not by any technical difficulty but because it is in its nature to exhaust itself in the course of its cooking, and consequently *to repeat itself* -- *sukiyaki* has nothing *marked* about it except its beginning (that tray painted with foodstuffs brought to the table); once 'started,' it no longer has moments or distinctive sites: it becomes decentered, like an uninterrupted text." (Barthes 22)

## The Interstice

"but whose real name would be *the interstice* without specific edges, or again: the empty sign" (Barthes 26)

"it is you who eat, but it is he who has played, who has written, who has produced" (Barthes 26)

## Pachinko

"Pachinko reproduces, in short, on the mechanical level, precisely the principle of painting *alla prima*, which insists that the line be drawn in a single movement, once and for all, and that by reason of the very quality of the paper and the ink, it can never be corrected" (Barthes 28)

## Center-City, Empty Center

"One of the two most powerful cities of modernity is thereby built around an opaque ring of walls, streams, roofs, and trees whose own center is no more than an evaporated notion, subsisting here, not in order to irradiate power, but to give to the entire urban movement the support of its central emptiness, forcing the traffic to make a perpetual detour.  In this manner, we are told, the system of the imaginary is spread circularly, by detours and returns the length of an empty subject." (Barthes 32)

## No Address

"For there to be a mastery of the real (in this case, the reality of addresses), it suffices that there be a system, even if this system is apparently illogical, uselessly complicated, curiously disparate: a good *bricolage* can not only *work* for a very long time, as we know; it can also satisfy millions of inhabitants inured, furthermore, to all the perfections of technological civilization" (Barthes 33)

## The Station

## Packages

"The miniature does not derive from the dimension but from a kind of precision which the thing observes in delimiting itself, stopping, finishing." (Barthes 43)

"It is as if, then, the box were the object of the gift, not what it contains.... Thus the box acts the sign: as envelope, screen, mask, it is *worth* what it conceals, protects, and yet designates..." (Barthes 46)

"the package is not empty, but emptied: to find the object which is in the package or the signified which is in the sign is to discard it..." (Barthes 46)

## The Three Writings

"*Bunraku* thus practices three separate writings, which it offers to be read simultaneously in three sites of the spectacle: the puppet, the manipulator, the vociferant: the effected gesture, the effective gesture, and the vocal gesture" (Barthes 49)

"*Bunraku* (this is its definition) separates action from gesture: it shows the gesture, lets the action be seen, exhibits simultaneously the art and the labor, reserving for each its own writing" (Barthes 54)

"A total spectacle but a divided one, *Bunraku* of course excludes improvisation: to return to spontaneity would be to return to the stereotypes which constitute our 'depth.' As Brecht had seen, here *citation* rules, the sliver of writing, the fragment of code, for none of the action's promoters can account in his own person for what he is never alone to write.  As in the modern text, the interweaving of codes, references, discrete assertions, anthological gestures multiplies the written line, not by virtue of some metaphysical appeal, but by the interaction of a *combinatoire* which opens out into the entire space of the theater: what is begun by one is continued by the next, without interval." (Barthes 55)

## Animate/Inanimate

"Concerned with a basic antimony, that of *animate/inanimate*, *Bunraku* jeopardizes it, eliminates it without advantage for either of its terms." (Barthes 58)

"this is what the *Bunraku* achieves, this is how it converts the body-as-fetish into the lovable body, this is how it rejects the antimony of *animate/inanimate* and dismisses the concept which is hidden behind all animation of matter and which is, quite simply, 'the soul.'" (Barthes 60)

## Inside/Outside

"*Bunraku* practices neither the occultation nor the emphatic manifestation of its means; hence it rids the actor's manifestation of any whiff of the sacred and abolishes the metaphysical link the West cannot help establishing between body and soul, cause and effect, motor and machine, agent and actor, Destiny and man, God and creature: if the manipulator is not hidden, why -- and how -- would you make him into a God?  In *Bunraku*, the puppet has no strings.  No more strings, hence no more metaphor, no more Fate; since the puppet no longer apes the creature, man is no longer a puppet in the divinity's hands, the *inside* no longer commands the *outside*." (Barthes 62)

## Bowing

"Occidental impoliteness is based on a certain mythology of the 'person.'  Topologically, Western man is reputed to be double, composed of a social, factitious, false 'outside' and of a personal, authentic 'inside' (the site of divine communication).  According to this schema, the human 'person' is that site filled by nature (or by divinity, or by guilt), girdled, closed by a social envelope which is anything but highly regarded: the polite gesture (when it is postulated) is the sign of respect exchanged from one plenitude to the other, across the worldly limit" (Barthes 63)

"The salutation here can be withdrawn from any humiliation or any vanity, because it literally salutes *no one*; it is not the sign of a communication -- closely watched, condescending and precautionary -- between two autarchies, two personal empires (each ruling over its Ego, the little realm of which it holds the 'key'); it is only the feature of a network of forms in which nothing is halted, knotted, profound.  *Who is saluting whom?*" (Barthes 68)

"Our ways of speaking are very vicious, for if I say that in that country politeness is a religion, I let it be understood that there is something sacred in it; the expression should be canted so as to suggest that religion there is merely a politeness, or better still, that religion has been replaced by politeness." (Barthes 68)

## The Breach of Meaning

"While being quite intelligible, the haiku means nothing, and it is by this double condition that it seems open to meaning in a particularly available, serviceable way -- the way of a polite host who lets you make yourself at home with all your preferences, you values, your symbols intact..." (Barthes 69)

"Hence the haiku seems to give the West certain rights which its own literature denies it, and certain commodities which are parsimoniously granted.  You are entitled, says the haiku, to be trivial, short, ordinary; enclose what you see, what you feel, in a slender horizon of words, and you will be interesting; you yourself (and starting from yourself) are entitled to establish your own notability; your sentence, whatever it may be, will enunciate a moral, will liberate a symbol, you will be profound: at the least possible cost, your writing will be *filled*." (Barthes 70)

"The West moistens everything with meaning" (Barthes 70)

## Exemption from Meaning

"All of Zen, of which the haiku is merely the literary branch, thus appears as an enormous praxis destined to *halt language*..." (Barthes 74)

"The *measurement* of language is what the Westerner is most unfit for: not that his utterance is too long or too short, but all his rhetoric obliges him to make signifier and signified disproportionate, either by 'diluting' the latter beneath the garrulous waves of the former, or by 'deepening' form toward the implicit regions of content." (Barthes 75)

## The Incident

"In the West, the mirror is an essentially narcissistic object: man conceives a mirror only in order to look at himself in it; but in the Orient, apparently, the mirror is empty; it is the symbol of the very emptiness of symbols...: the mirror intercepts only other mirrors, and this infinite reflection is emptiness itself" (Barthes 78-79)

"What one can add is that these infinitesimal adventures (of which the accumulation, in the course of a day, provokes a kind of erotic intoxication) never have anything picturesque about them (the Japanese picturesque is indifferent to us, for it is detached from what constitutes the very specialty of Japan, which is its modernity), or anything novelistic (never lending themselves to the chatter which would make them into narratives or descriptions); what they offer to be *read* (I am, in that country, a reader, not a visitor) is the rectitude of the line, the stroke, without wake, without margin, without vibration..." (Barthes 79-80)

## So

"Such *traces* (the word suits the haiku, a kind of faint gash inscribed upon time) establish what we have been able to call 'the vision without commentary.'" (Barthes 82)

"what is abolished is not meaning but any notion of finality" (Barthes 82)

"Here meaning is only a flash, a slash of light: *When the light of sense goes out, but with a flash that has revealed the invisible world*, Shakespeare wrote; but the haiku's flash illumines, reveals notion; it is the flash of a photograph one takes very carefully (in the Japanese manner) but having neglected to lead the camera with film." (Barthes 83)

"like a decorative loop, the haiku coils back on itself, the wake of the sign which seems to have been traced is erased: nothing has been acquired, the world's stone has been cast for nothing: neither waves nor flow of meaning." (Barthes 84)

## Stationery Store

"ours is quick to transform writing into a mercantile product: it pre-edits the text at the very moment one writes it; theirs, by its countless characters, no longer aligned in a single row of letters but rolled on drums, refers to the ideographic marquetry scattered across the sheet -- in a word, space; hence the machine extends, at least potentially, a true graphic art which would no longer be the aesthetic labor of the solitary letter but the abolition of the sign, flung aslant, freehand, in all the directions of the page." (Barthes 87)

## The Written Face

"the actor, in his face, does not play the woman, or copy her, but only signifies her; if, as Mallarmé says, writing consists of 'gestures of the idea,' transvestism here is the gesture of femininity, not its plagiarism" (Barthes 89)

## Millions of Bodies

"Here individuality is not closure, theater, outstripping, victory; it is simply difference, refracted, without privilege, from body to body." (Barthes 98)

## The Eyelid

## The Writing of Violence

"In our mythology, violence is caught up in the same prejudice as literature or art: we can attribute to it no other function than that of *expressing* a content, an inwardness, a nature, of which it is the primary, savage, asystematic language" (Barthes 103)
