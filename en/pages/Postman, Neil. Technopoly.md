Postman, Neil. Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. New York: Vintage Books, 1993.


Introduction

Sir Charles Snow's _The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution_ -- about "the opposition of art and science, or, more precisely, the implacable hostility between literary intellectuals and physical scientists" (Postman xi)

"Stated in the most dramatic terms, the accusation can be made that the uncontrolled growth of technology destroys the vital sources of our humanity" (Postman xii)


Chapter 1:  The Judgment of Thamus

book for "people such as ourselves, who are inclined (in Thoreau's phrase) to be tools of our tools" (Postman 3)

"Every technology is both a burden and a blessing" (Postman 4-5)

warped reading of McLuhan:  "the uses made of any technology are largely determined by the structure of the technology itself" (Postman 7)

"those who cultivate competence in the use of a new technology become an elite group that are granted an undeserved authority and prestige by those who have no such competence... those who have control over the workings of a particular technology accumulate power and inevitably form a kind of conspiracy against those who have no access to the specialized knowledge made available by the technology" (Postman 9)

"One might say, then, that, if there is a conspiracy of any kind, it is that of a culture conspiring against itself" (Postman 12)

"embedded in every tool is an ideological bias, a predisposition to construct the world as one thing rather than another" (Postman 13)

"new technologies compete with old ones -- for time, for attention, for money, for prestige, but mostly for dominance of their world-view" (Postman 16)

"television attacking the printed word" (Postman 16)

"Surrounding every technology are institutions whose organization -- not to mention their reason for being -- reflects the world-view promoted by the technology.  Therefore, when an old technology is assaulted by a new one, institutions are threatened.  When institutions are threatened, a culture finds itself in crisis" (Postman 18)

"New technologies alter the structure of our interests:  the things we think *about*.  They alter the character of our symbols:  the things we think *with*.  And they alter the nature of community:  the arena in which thoughts develop" (Postman 20)


Chapter 2:  From Tools to Technocracy

Marx:  technologies create the ways in which people perceive reality

3 types of cultures:  tool-using cultures, technocracies, and technopolies

theocracy=good! technocracy=bad!

"In a technogracy, tools play a central role in the thought-world of the culture.  Everything must give way, in some degree, to their development....  Tools are not integrated into the culture; they attack the culture.  They bid to *become* the culture" (Postman 28)

one of the pillars of technocracy:  separation of moral and intellectual values


Chapter 3:  From Technocracy to Technopoly

development of factory system, machine-tool indusstry, Luddism

"The technocratic culture eroded the line that had made the intellectual interests of educated people inaccessible to the worling class" (Postman 44)

political and religious freedom and the idea of progress

two thought-worlds in technocracy:  the technological and the traditional; traditional disappears in technopoly

"totalitarian technocracy" (Postman 48)

"Technocracies are concerned to invent machinery.  That people's lives are changed by machinery is taken as a matter of course, and that people must sometimes by treated as if they were machinery is considered a necessary and unfortunate condition of technological development.  But in technocracies, such a condition is not held to be a philosophy of culture.  Technocracy does not have as its aim a grand reductionism in which human life must find its meaning in machinery and techniques.  Technopoly does" (Postman 52)


Chapter 4:  The Improbable World

incomprehensibility of the contemporary world; information chaos

"the elevation of information to a metaphysical status:  information as both the means and the end of human creativity" (Postman 61)

age of information began with printing press; book format innovations as attempt to control flow of information; schools as technocracy's first secular bureaucracies

"The presumed close connection among information, reason, and usefulness began to lose its legitimacy toward the mid-nineteenth century with the invention of the telegraph" (Postman 67) -- see _Amusing Ourselves to Death_, context-free info

the telegraph turned information into a commodity

Daniel Boorstin and "the graphic revolution":  "The new imagery, with photography at its forefront, did not merely function as a supplement to language but tended to replace it as our dominant means for construing, understanding, and testing reality" (Postman 68)

"The milieu in which Technopoly flourishes is the one in which the tie between information and human purposes has been severed" (Postman 70)


Chapter 5:  The Broken Defenses

Technopoly "consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and takes its orders from technology" (Postman 71)

Technopoly "is what happens when a culture, overcome by information generated by technology, tries to employ technology itself as a means of providing clear direction and humane purpose" (Postman 72)

defenses against information:  family, curriculum, church, state, theory -- all gone

instead:  bureaucrats and experts; technical machinery used to control info; actually propagate


Chapter 6:  The Ideology of Machines: Medical Technolpgy

over-reliance of doctors on technology


Chapter 7:  The Ideology of Machines: Computer Technology

"The fundamental metaphorical message of the computer, in short, is that we are machines -- thinking machines, to be sure, but machines nonetheless" (Postman 111) -- see J. David Bolter, _Turing's Man_

"From the proposition that humans are in some respects like machines, we move to the proposition that humans are little else but machines and, finaly, that human beings *are* machines.  And then, inevitably... to the proposition that machines are human beings" (Postman 112)

Stanley Milgram and the "agentic shift" in which humans transfer responsibility to machines


Chapter 8:  Invisible Technologies

language as technology:  "language is pure ideology" (Postman 123)

statistics as technology; problems:  reification (making abstract idea into a thing); ranking; biased questions

language is a kind of technics, thought which we can achieve humanity

"The argument, in short, is not with technique.  The argument is with the triumph of technique, with techniques that become sanctified and rule out the possibilities of other ones" (Postman 142)


Chapter 9:  Scientism

scientism = three interrelated ideas:  "that the methods of the natural sciences can be applied to the study of human behavior... that social science generates specific principles which can be used to organize society on a rational basis... that faith in science can serve as a comprehensive belief system that gives meaning to life, as well as a sense of well-being, morality, and even immortality" (Postman 147)

social "sciences" as much more aking to literature than to science; creation of narratives


Chapter 10:  The Great Symbol Drain

dilution of symbols via advertising, etc.

"mass advertising is not the cause of the great symbol drain.  Such cultural abuse could not have occurred without technologies to make it possible and a world-view to make it desirable" (Postman 171)

dissolution of American education -- loss of purpose


Chapter 11:  The Loving Resistance Fighter

return to humanities/"great books"-based curriculum
