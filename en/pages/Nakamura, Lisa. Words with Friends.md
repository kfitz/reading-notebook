Nakamura, Lisa. “‘Words with Friends’: Socially Networked Reading on Goodreads.” PMLA 128.1 (2013): 238–243. doi://10.1632/pmla.2013.128.1.238.

- need to pay attention not to "how far our devices are taking us from paper—the answer is already pretty far—but rather how digital media are creating new social valences of reading" (238)
- "Like social media generally, digital reading is migrating toward a service-based rather than hardware-based model of consumption, which is why online social networks like Goodreads are important sites of study for literary scholars" (238)
- "Goodreads foregrounds reading as a spectacle of collecting" (240)
- "the reading apparatus takes a backseat to the site’s main purpose: to provide users with familiar tools that encourage them to perform their identities as readers in a public and networked forum" (240)
- "by availing ourselves of its networked virtual bookshelves to collect and display our readerliness in a postprint age, we have become objects to be collected, by Goodreads and its myriad commercial partners… we are both collecting and being collected under a new regime of controlled consumerism" (241)
- "Built on “play labor”—the recreational activity of sharing our labor as readers, writers, and lovers of books and inviting our friends from the social graph to come, look, buy, and share— Goodreads efficiently captures the value of our recommendations, social ties, affective networks, and collections of friends and books. Goodreads bookshelves are unlike real bookshelves not because the books are not real but because they are not really ours" (242)
- "open access to a for-profit site like Goodreads has always exacted a price—loss of privacy, friction-free broadcasting of our personal information, the placing of user content in the service of commerce, and the operationalization and commodification of reading as an algocratic practice" (242)
- "Now more than ever, literary scholars must bring their skills to bear on digitally networked reading. Researchers who are versed in reading’s many cultures, economies, and conditions of reception know that it is never possible for a reading platform to be a 'passive conduit.' For reading has always been social, and reading’s economies, cultures of sharing, and circuits of travel have never been passive" (243)
