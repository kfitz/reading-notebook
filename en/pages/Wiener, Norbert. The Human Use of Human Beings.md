Wiener, Norbert.  The Human Use of Human Beings:  Cybernetics and Society.  New York:  Anchor Books, 1954.


Preface:  The Idea of a Contingent Universe

change in worldview in 10th century; end of Newtonian outlook -- introduction of statistics into physics

"As entropy increases, the universe, and all closed systems in the universe, tend naturally to deteriorate and lose their distinctiveness, to move from the least to the most probable state, from a state of organization and differentiation in which distinctions and forms exist, to a state of chaos and sameness" (Wiener 12)

however, there are "local enclaves" in which organization may temporarily increase:  "Life finds its home in some of those enclaves.  It is with this point of view at its core that the new science of Cybernetics began its development" (Wiener 12)


I.  Cybernetics in History

the theory of messages -- communication and control; communication with machines

entropy = disorganization; information = organization

feedback:  the "control of a machine on the basis of its *actual* performance rather than its *expected* performance" (Wiener 24)

feedback mechanisms serve to control entropy


II.  Progress and Entropy

Maxwell's demon -- cost of information

machines "contribute to a local and temporary building up of information" (Wiener 31) -- a good thing, anti-entropic

"the problem as to whether the machine is alive or not is, for our purposes, semantic and we are at liberty to answer it one way or the other as best suits our convenience" (Wiener 32)

re disorganization:  "Is this devil Manichaean or Augustinian?" (Wiener 34)

quantum theory has led to "a new association of energy and information" (Wiener 38-39)


III.  Rigidity and Learning:  Two Patterns of Communicative Behavior

insect (outer shell) v. human (inner skeleton)

"Cybernetics takes the view that the structure of the machine or of the organism is an index of the performance that may be expected from it" (Wiener 57)

learning:  when feedback can change performance


IV.  The Mechanism and History of Language

"In a certain sense, all communication systems terminate in machines, but the ordinary language systems terminate in the special sort of machine known as a human being" (Wiener 79)

"With the airplane and the radio the word of the rulers extends to the ends of the earth, and very many of the factors which previously precluded a World State have been abrogated" (Wiener 92) -- the unintentional fascism of the global village?


V.  Organization as the Message

by transport of information, man extends himself/his senses/his control; transmission of man?


VI.  Law and Communication

"Law may be defined as the ethical control applied to communication" (Wiener 105)

"the problems of law may be considered communicative and cybernetic" (Wiener 110)


VII.  COmmunication, Secrecy, and Social Policy

rise of secrecy in tandem with rise of communications network

"The fate of information in the typically American world is to become something which can be bought or sold" (Wiener 113)


VIII.  Role of the Intellectual and the Scientist


IX.  The First and the Second Industrial Revolution


X.  Some Communications Machines and Their Future

a class of machines with sinister possibilities:  including chess-playing machine (Wiener 175) -- game theory --\> military tactics

"When human atoms are knit into an organization in which they are used, not in their full right as responsible human beings, but as cogs and levers and rods, it matters little that their raw material is flesh and blood.  *What is used as an element in a machine, is in fact and element in the machine*" (Wiener 185)


XI.  Language, Confusion, and Jam
