“But despite the lamentations of many contemporary Jeremiahs, the cause of reading is not a lost one by any means.” (5)

“I find myself particularly intrigued by younger people who have heard their cohort called ‘The Dumbest Generation,’ who are continually told that their addiction to multiple simultaneous stimuli renders them incapable of the seriously focused and single-minded attention that the reading of big thick books requires. Some of them are defiant in response to such charges, but most at least half-believe them. Told over and over again that they can’t read, they begin to wonder why they should even try.” (6)

“But the American DIY tradition is by no means a contemptible one; it just needs, especially when applied to reading, a little updating.” (8)

“Forget for a moment how books should be read: Why should they be read? The first reason — the first sequentially in the story that follows but also the first in order of importance — is that reading books can be intensely pleasurable. Reading is one of the great human delights.” (10)

“This self-help, self-improvement model of reading seems deeply embedded in American cultural life: even Michael Dirda, a wonderfully sensitive and human reader-critic, in his Book by Book, can’t resist offering a master list of sixteen works and asserting that if you just read these particular texts with care, ‘nearly all of world literature will be an open book to you.’” (11)

“Books that aren’t certifiably good for you are, in this way of thinking, to be suspected — and to read for ‘entertainment,’ or the sheer pleasure of the thing, verges on the morally unjustifiable.” (11)

Zadie Smith: “I always feel a disappointment coming out of English departments, as if all these brilliant people are gathered and poised to study something and all they have to study is… these things? Novels? But they’re so… smooshy… It depresses me, how embarrassed some people seem to be about novels, how much they want them to be something else.” (qtd on 12)

“So one reason I usually decline to give reading recommendations is that I don’t want to encourage such habits of mind. But there’s a positive counterpart to this negative reason: my commitment to one dominant, overarching, nearly definitive principle for reading: Read at Whim.” (15)

“The book that simply demands to be read, for no good reason, is asking us to change our lives by putting aside what we usually think of as good reasons. It’s asking us to stop calculating. It’s asking us to do something for the plain old delight and interest of it, not because we can justify its place on the mental spreadsheet or accounting ledger (like the one Benjamin Franklin kept) by which we tote up the value of our actions.” (16)

“That Adler and Van Doren have these suspicions is indicated by their choice of the word entertainment — a dismissive word in comparison to ones I have just used, pleasure and joy, and often prefaced by the adjective ‘mere.’… ‘pleasure’ and ‘joy’ are richer words, with a greater range of connotations: there can be guilty pleasures, but abiding ones as well. Adler and Van Doren don’t want to get into these complications, preferring the simple distinction between entertainment, on the one trivial hand, and information and understanding, on the strong and noble other. But to divide the world of reading in this way is to leave yourself unable to account for pleasure, and likely to mistrust it when it comes.” (17)

“Some years back Bloom wrote a book called How to Read and Why, but it really should have been called What to Read and What to Think about It.” (18) — see esp Bloom on Harry Potter

“Young people often signal through their pretensions what they hope to become: they have discerned, maybe in a limited way, some good and they are pursuing it as best they can, given limited knowledge and experience. They see people whom they admire, or are in some way attracted to, and they try to copy the preferences of those paragons. Such copying can lead to more and more pretension; but in many cases the pretense becomes real: the tastes we aspire too often become our own tastes.” (22)

“While I agree with Harold Bloom about many things and am thankful for his long advocacy for the greatest of stories and poems, in these matters I am firmly on the side of Lewis and Chesterton. Read what gives you delight — at least most of the time — and do so without shame.” (23)

“I want simply to emphasize that, having better understood the near-miracle of our ability to decode marks on paper, we are left with a truth equally remarkable: that some of us greatly desire to do so, and that some of us find abiding consolation in what we encounter when our eyes scan words on the page in those strange jerky saccades. That images striking the retina can be transferred to the edge of the left occipito-temporal fissure, and there can be decoded, is extraordinary; that what is decoded there can bring tears to the eyes, or cause laughter to rise up from the diaphragm, or bring to a deeply unhappy boy cut off from his beloved mother a few hours, or many hours, of joy… I don’t have words to express how deeply strange this is.” (33)

“It’s easy to see why Chabon believes that ‘all literature, highbrow or low, from the Aeneid onward, is fan fiction. That is why Harold Bloom’s notion of the anxiety of influence has always rung so hollow to me…. All novels are sequels; influence is bliss.’” (35-36)

“So if I don’t want to say that all reading is equally good, equally valuable, but I also don’t want to give in to the Vigilant School, then what standard of readerly value am I appealing to? Answer: I am appealing to the standard of the reader’s own pleasure — a criterion that sounds more simple and straightforward than it is.” (38)

“a vital distinction between what I shall call whim and Whim. In its lower-case version, whim is thoughtless, directionless preference that almost invariably leads to boredom or frustration or both. But Whim is something very different: it can guide us because it is based in self-knowledge” (41)

“The better we know ourselves the better we will be able to make some of the decisions that all readers must face — for instance, and notably, the decision to persist in reading a book that fails to delight.” (41)

“Those of us who want to be better readers have to be self-guided in this way. And one of the primary reasons I am so suspicious of How to Read a Book and similar guides is that they promise to help us offload accountability for our reading: they say, implicitly, that self-knowledge and discernment aren’t needful because experts can take care of that for us.” (43)

“For almost all of us, then, Hume’s writing will provide a kind of test — an opportunity to find out just how much patience we have, how much time we’re willing to take. And to spare any suspense on this point, the results of that test will almost certainly be: no patient enough.” (49)

“Some forms of intellectual labor are worth the trouble. In those times when Whim isn’t enough, times that will come to us all, we discover this. Such work strengthens our minds, makes us more capable of concentration, teaches us patience — and almost certainly a touch of humility as well, as we struggle to navigate the difficult (if elegant) terrain of Hume’s prose. But what do we have more need for, in our whirling mental worlds, than strength and concentration and patience and humility? These are virtues worth aspiring to, especially because they lead to new and greater delights.” (50)

“we have gone long enough without raising the question of whether reading makes you a better person. The short answer to that question is No. It doesn’t. And the long answer doesn’t differ too dramatically from the short one.” (52)

“Nevertheless, I am going to argue, from time to time throughout the course of this book, that if you really want to become a better person, there are ways in which reading can help. But the degree to which that happens will depend not just on what you read — you have already seen that I am not dictatorial about that — but also why and how.” (53)

“one of the wonderful things about books is that they don’t grow agitated or dismissive. They patiently bear all the scrutiny you choose to give them, and the more carefully you read them the more of their secrets they yield. It’s as though they are asking to be put to the question, announcing their readiness to be investigated.” (53-54)

of writers: “We publish at least in part because we want a personal connection. The more positive that connection the better, of course, but it must be human. And that means that, ideally, there will be something independently thoughtful and constructive in the reader’s response.” (54)

“Reading is more challenging and enjoyable — more worth the candle — if we are willing to answer the questions a text puts to us, even (or especially) if those questions are implicit.” (55)

Alberto Manguel: “All writing depends on the generosity of the reader.” (qtd on 55)

“if you write the question in the book’s margin — even if you just scrawl a question mark — you are marking the scene of your confusion. You are registering your puzzlement, not for the book’s sake but for your own sake. The interruption in the flow of your reading is a significant event, and you are quite literally taking note of it. Writing out the whole of your question is better than just flinging a question mark onto the page, because doing the former takes more time — it gets you out of the flow of mere passive reception — and because it forces you to articulate to precise nature of your vexation.” (56)

Charles Simic: “I would love to see an anthology of comments and underlined passages by readers of history books in public libraries, who despite the strict prohibition of such activity could not help themselves and had to register their complaints about the author of the book or the direction in which humanity has been heading for the last few thousand years.” (qtd on 57)

“Almost everything I have written in these pages assumes something that in the history of reading has rarely been true: abundant and inexpensive books. I have to make an effort to remember what an extraordinary blessing this is.” (58)

“In general, when I use the term ‘book’ I will be referring to texts long enough to be bound between covers, whether they actually are bound between such covers or not.” (63)

“the technologies that make most e-readers work enforce a strict distinction between two kinds of annotative activity… When you’re reading a codex with a pencil in hand, you might scribble a comment in the margin — which could be comprised of words but also symbols: stars, exclamation points, checkmarks — or you might circle a key word, or you might underline a key passage. All this is done with the same technology, employed in the same way. But on most e-readers you use one entry method to underline or highlight text, another one to type in comments, and a third one to ‘bookmark’ the page” (64)

“Reading is supposed to be about the encounter with other minds, not an opportunity to return to the endlessly appealing subject of Me.” (67) — Jacobs makes this point with respect to the bkkeepr service, which uses tweets about your reading to trumpet how fast you read; the concern here is not the social or electronic mediation of reading, but that it reduces reading to quantitative bragging about consumption

“It is wrong to lie, but it may be still more wrong to read a bunch of books you don’t want to read — and by ‘read’ them I mean cast your eyes across most of the lines on most of the pages — in order to impress people whose opinion you shouldn’t be deferring to anyhow. So it would be less bad, I think, [to] take a little time to figure out what people will be impressed to hear that you’re reading, use Wikipedia to find out just enough about those books to enable you to bluff plausibly when questioned — and then go back home and read whatever you want to read. And read it at your own pace, without pausing even for a second to think about what your rate of words per minute is. You probably read too fast anyway.” (68-69)

“all things considered, I believe that most people read quickly because they want not to read but to have read. But why do they want to have read? Because, I think, they conceive of reading simply as a means of uploading information to their brains.” (72)

“I don’t think that e-readers are going to be a cure-all for everyone in need of cultivating better and longer attention. But I do think that my experience suggests that it’s not reasonable to think of ‘technology’ — in the usual vaguely pejorative meaning of that word — as the enemy of reading. The codex is itself a technology, and a supremely sophisticated one, but even digital electronic technologies vary tremendously: e-readers are by any measure far less distracting than and iPad or a laptop. It’s at least possible for new technologies to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem.” (82)

Sam Anderson: “The Internet is basically a Skinner box engineered to tap right into our deepest mechanisms of addiction.” (qtd on 83)

“This is a situation — and this stage in my argument a moment — which seems to lend itself to advice, to recommendations. But what would be the point? We all already know what we need to do if we want to get back to reading slowly and attentively. Shut down the computer; put aside the cellphone. If the temptation to check email or texts or Twitter is too strong, then take yourself somewhere where the gadgets aren’t.” (84)

“This is why attentiveness is worth cultivating: not just because it is good for you or because (as Gallagher also says) it can help you ‘organize your world,’ but because such raptness is deeply satisfying. It is, really, what Whim is all about; what Whim is for. I even think that such satisfaction is largely what David Foster Wallace has in mind when he says that without attentiveness, and the ability to choose what we will attend to, we will be ‘totally hosed’ — because after all, people get by without being able to make such choices. Many of them have very successful lives, in most of the ways that we measure success. But they’re missing something, something vital, by never knowing what it’s like to be so absorbed.” (86)

“Few lessons could be more valuable, or more consequential, because to read in this utterly absorbed way I have been describing is to collaborate with a book on the conquest of time.” (89)

“All books want our attention, but not all of them want the same kind of attention, and good readers know this and make the necessary adjustments.” (98)

“we could do worse than employ the threefold model of our old friends Adler and Van Doren: reading for information, reading for understanding, reading for entertainment.” (98) — though Jacobs substitutes “pleasure” for “entertainment”

“While virtually anyone who wants to do so can train his or her brain to the habits of long-form reading, in any given culture few people will want to. And that’s to be expected. Serious ‘deep attention’ reading has always been and will always be a minority pursuit, a fact that has been obscured by the past half-century, especially in the United States, by the dramatic increase in the percentage of the population attending college, and by the idea (only about 150 years old) that modern literature in vernacular languages should be taught at the university level.” (106)

“much of the anxiety about American reading habits, and those in other developed nations to a lesser degree, arises from frustration at not being able to sustain a permanent expansion of ‘the reading class’ beyond what may be its natural limits.” (107) — I might dispute this use of the term “natural,” but otherwise, yes

“Rarely had education been about teaching children, adolescents, or young adults how to read lengthy and complicated texts with sustained, deep, appreciative attention — at least, not since the invention of the printing press.” (109)

“a chief theme of Jonathan Rose’s magisterial Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes is that the culture of reading among those classes was more dynamic, more impassioned, before the study of English literature was incorporated into the general curriculum of English schools” (113)

“Education is and should be primarily about intellectual navigation, about — I scruple not to say it — skimming well, and reading carefully for information in order to upload content. Slow and patient reading, by contrast, properly belongs to our leisure hours.” (114)

“Such imaginative engagements can only come through the written word when the reader possesses, or is possessed by, deep solitude — whether that solitude is given by circumstance or created, even in the midst of a crowd, by force of will sharpened by habit.” (124-25)

“Such rereading is not purely a matter of escapism, even though that is one reason for its attraction: we should note that it’s not what readers are escaping from but what they are escaping into that counts most. Most of us do not find fictional worlds appealing because we find our own lives despicable, though censorious people often make that assumption…. The sleeper does not disdain consciousness.” (130-31)

“Our goal as adults is not to love all books alike, or as few as possible, but rather to love as widely and as well as our limited selves will allow.” (135)

“Reading is a way of connecting with others, but the connection is an odd combination of the intimate and the virtual” (135)

“those who are not satisfied by book groups tend to give two reasons. The minor one is that the books chosen are rarely challenging enough to provide first-rate conversation. The major one is that too few participants in book groups are interested in really exploring the books: rather, for them, books seem to be an excuse for talking about other matters that they’re more deeply invested in, often their own emotional lives.” (137)

“The more I think about this, the more I realize how difficult a task book-group leaders, including Oprah Winfrey, have: the book has to be substantive enough to give people something to talk about, but not so difficult that people can’t persevere to the end, or that they feel inadequate to the conversation. And if the book is either too simple or too challenging, the most natural thing to do is fall back on one’s response to it — on one’s own feelings. (Apparent emotivism in this case being a token not of narcissism but of a need to keep a conversation going when the ostensible topic of conversation provides few resources.)” (137)

“As far as common sense can tell, every good idea ever achieved is the produce of both connection and contemplation, of moving back and forth between the two.” (141)

“Reading too is, or should be, a moving between the solitary encounter and something more social. Even when the ‘more social’ thing is just an entry in a private diary, it constitutes a step away from the silent absorption in a text, an attempt to account for and therefore make one’s response more intersubjective, that is, connected to, interacting with, the experiences of others.” (141)

“Encounters with other readers can be a vital source of improvements in our judgments, particularly, I think, in teaching us not to be too quickly dismissive: when we hear that others who have been more charitably disposed to a book have gotten something out of it that we missed, we may well be moved to be more charitable ourselves in the future.” (142)

“So reading, which starts for many of us in a warm cocoon of security, accompanied by an unassailable sense of being loved, gradually and inexorably — Gibbon would say insensibly — turns into a site of stress. It becomes a contested environment in which we succeed or fail, perhaps all alone, and that unwanted solitude causes us to reattach ourselves, or to keep ourselves attached, to others who can both direct and validate.” (148)

“That so many of us conquer our fears of being cut off and embrace this solitude — this solitude that is also a connection — suggests that the rewards of reading can be considerable indeed.” (149)
