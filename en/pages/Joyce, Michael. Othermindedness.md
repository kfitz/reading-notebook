Introduction.  Othermindedness: The Emergence of Network Culture

Prelude.  Screendoor: A Meditation on the Outsider

Chapter 1.  (Re)Placing the Author:  “A Book in the Ruins”

shifting notions of “place” in the electronic text

contour:  “one expression of the perceptible form of a constantly changing text, made by any of its readers or writers at a given point in its reading or writing.  Its constituent elements include the current state of the text at hand, the perceived intentions and interactions of previous writers and readers that led to the text at hand, and those interactions with the text that the current reader or writer sees as leading from it.  Contours are represented by the current reader or writer as a narrative.  They are communicated in a set of operations upon the current text that have the effect of transforming that text.  Contours are discovered sensually, and most often they are read in the visual form of the verbal, graphical, or moving text.” (Joyce 22)

“Print... maps itself against the geometric and so stays itself; electronic text, conversely and topologically, replaces itself.” (Joyce 24)

Chapter 2.  MOO or Mistakenness

Chapter 3.  New Stories for New Readers

“The computer, like our classrooms, becomes a theater of our desires as well as our differences.” (Joyce 50)

coherence — desire for sense, and yet stricture; developing new coherences

appropriate as a trope the middle voice of classical Greek verb — neither active nor passive, but present

Chapter 4.  The Lingering Errantness of Place, or, Library as Library

Chapter 5.  Beyond Next before You Once Again:  Repossessing and Renewing Electronic Culture

“ourselves expressed within time and space” (Joyce 81) — attempting to resolve temporality and spatiality?

concerns about the passivity electronic media encourage

exploratory v. constructive hypertexts

“This is to summon an othermindedness that is less a focus on the other than upon our mindedness.  Networked learning calls us to be mindful of ourselves in increasingly other roles than that as passive consumer, but rather as cocreator and reciprocal actor.” (Joyce 83)

“What, finally, are we to make of the fundamentalist aspects of what seems a wood-pulp fetishism among the postlapsarian (I won’t call them neo-Luddites, Ned Ludd’s fight is my fight as well:  we are who we are, we have bodies that the machines can’t deny) critics of new writing technologies?” (Joyce 88)

“The wood-pulp fetishism of postlapsarian critics seems at first a mistrust of the eye and a privileging of the hand.... Yet there is a sense of reading that seems to favor the eye and mistrust it in the same gesture.” (Joyce 95)

“What comes next?  Will the web supplant or supplement the world or book?  When we get older we move toward the feminine, toward repose.  I’m a little tired of the supplant-and-supplement question (even if I am in some sense guilty of forwarding it).  Linear and hypertextual narratives seem a polarity but are only opposite shores of a stream.  Our literacy is littoral.  There are no linear stories, only linear tellings or readings.  Supplant is a strange word (the dictionary renders it in terms of ‘intrigue and underhanded tactics’); I prefer succeed, with all its senses.  If the linear narrative, insofar as it is aware of itself as a form, has always wished to succeed itself (as it seems, at least by the witness of its practitioners, it has), then it is unlikely that the hypertextual narrative will be any less ambitious.” (Joyce 105)

Chapter 6.  Songs of Thy Selves:  Persistence, Momentariness, Recurrence, and the MOO

“There is a claim here, hardly made as yet, that we live out our deaths by somehow symbolically mapping space (through language, image, movement, even the implied spatiality of sound that creates through interval) in relation to our bodies.” (Joyce 109)

MOO as spatial v. MOO as temporal (Joyce 114)

“Against the commonly cited momentariness of MOO experience and the evanescence of the selves that form within it, there stands the rhythm of recurrence on unknown screens elsewhere; the persistence of certain “objects” that, like the consumerist flotsam of temporal existence (a brown bottle or a sailboat), mark the swell and surge of lives lived in body, space, and time.  The mark is the mark of the momentary itself, meaning within meaningfulness not against meaninglessness.” (Joyce 120)

Intermezzo.  One Story:  Present Tense Spaces of the Heart

“What seems to me most interesting about hypermedia now is the inherent tensional opposition (to use Carolyn Guyer’s phrase) between image and text.” (Joyce 128)

“What we read in the difference between the desire and the trace is how the forms of things mean, more than one kind of reading, the totality of the work, the inverse of the simulacrum, the contour, the multiple story.” (Joyce 130)

Chapter 7.  Nonce upon Some Times:  Rereading Hypertext Fiction

“Hypertext only more consciously than other texts implicates the reader in writing at least its sequences by her choices.” (Joyce 131)

“Hypertext is the confirmation of the visual kinetic of rereading.” (Joyce 132)

“Traditional definitions of hypertext begin with nonlinearity, which however is not a good place to end given the overwhelming force of our mortality in the face of our metaphors.” (Joyce 147) — see 132: “…start…”

Chapter 8.  On Boundfulness:  The Space of Hypertext Bodies
