culturalism (Williams); structuralism (Althusser)

Althusser re-reading Marx through linguistic paradigm

“The causal logic of determinacy was abandoned in favour of a structuralist causality — a logic of arrangement, of internal relations, of articulation of parts within a structure.” (65)

Althusser on ideology:  “the themes, concepts and representations through which men and women ‘live,’ in an imaginary relation, their relation to their real conditions of existence” (65-66)

overdetermination

experience as an effect; an “imaginary relation”

in ISA: “how this ‘imaginary relation’ served, not simply the dominance of a ruling class over a dominated one, but . . . the expanded reproduction of the mode of production itself.” (66)
