Rainie, Lee.  "The State of Blogging."  January 2005.  Pew Internet and American Life Project.  <http://www.pewinternet.org/2005/01/02/the-state-of-blogging/>


by the end of 2004, "7% of the 120 million U.S. adults who use the internet say they have created a blog or web-based diary. That represents more than 8 million people" (1)

"27% of internet users say they read blogs, a 58% jump from the 17% who told us they were blog readers in February. This means that by the end of 2004 32 million Americans were blog readers" (1)

"5% of internet users say they use RSS aggregators or XML readers to get the news and other information delivered from blogs and content-rich Web sites as it is posted online" (1)

"12% of internet users have posted comments or other material on blogs" (1)

"At the same time, for all the excitement about blogs and the media coverage of them, blogs have not yet become recognized by a majority of internet users. Only 38% of all internet users know what a blog is. The rest are not sure what the term 'blog' means" (1)

"Blog creators are more likely to be:
• Men: 57% are male
• Young: 48% are under age 30
• Broadband users: 70% have broadband at home
• Internet veterans: 82% have been online for six years or more
• Relatively well off financially: 42% live in households earning over $50,000
• Well educated: 39% have college or graduate degrees" (2)

"Blog readers are somewhat more of a mainstream group than bloggers themselves. Like bloggers, blog readers are more likely to be young, male, well educated, internet veterans. Still, since our survey February, there has been greater-than-average growth in blog readership among women, minorities, those between the ages of 30 and 49, and those with home dialup connections" (2)
