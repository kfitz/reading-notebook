Introduction: Digital Books, Beach Chairs, and Popular Literary Culture

"I was overwhelmed by the absurdity not of the store's décor but of my presuming to teach my students anything about contemporary literature without taking superstores, blockbuster film adaptations, and television book clubs into account, not just as symptoms of the current state of the *culture industry* but as the sites, delivery systems, and forms of connoisseurship that formed the fabric of a *popular* literary culture." (2)

reading of Barth's "The Literature of Replenishment" as setting "his agenda for replenishment, namely, a reconnection between the literary novelists and the broad-based audience that had been commonplace in the premodern period" (2)

"Popular literary culture, in a variety of new incarnations, now appears to be everywhere you look -- at the multiplex, driving down the strip, floating through the mall, or surfing the Net.  And over the course of those twenty years, those early Christians -- the professors of literature -- ran amuck, allegedly refusing to hold up their end of the conversation as they spoke in High Theory and killed off authors on a regular basis before some returned, eager to connect with addicted readers, who congregated enthusiastically online and on television, to share fiercely held opinions about books.  Apparently, the love of literature can no be fully experienced only outside the academy and the New York literary scene, out there somewhere in the wilds of popular culture." (3)

"the complete redefinition of what literary reading means within the heart of electronic culture... massive infrastructural changes in literary culture that introduced a new set of players, locations, rituals, and use values for reading literary fiction" (3)

"The use value of reading quality fiction -- what we read it *for* -- has become a central issue in novels that insist on their ability to perform a vitally important function in the lives of those reading-addicted television viewers" (4)

"taking Flaubert to the beach involves another kind of empowerment in addition to new forms of digital downloadability; it depends every bit as much on amateur readers feeling perfectly comfortable taking on books that were formerly thought to be fully accessible only to professionalized readers" (6)

"changes in taste hierarchies -- the radical devaluation of the academy and New York literary scene as taste brokers who maintained the gold standard of literary currency, the collapse of the traditional dichotomies that made book reading somehow naturally antagonistic to film going or television watching, and the transformation of taste acquisition into an industry with taste arbiters becoming media celebrities." (7-8)

"This is not a bumper sticker book, e.g., /Honk If You Think Culture Is Going to Hell in a Handbasket/ or /My Literary Values Aren't Dead, Sorry about Yours/. My goal in this book is to trace the contours of a particular 'media ecology' shaped by the increasing convergence of literary, visual, and material cultures." (8)

"interdependent components of a popular literary culture that has its own ways of identifying a literary experience as such, with its own way of 'talking the talk' of passionate reading, its own modes of circulation and access, and its own authorities to sanction what sort of pleasures are to be enjoyed there" (8)

Kevin Kelly, "Scan This Book!": "Kelly argues compellingly that the basic contours of what constitutes a book have been changed by a digital revolution." (9)

"What happens to literary reading when it becomes a sophisticated form of self-help therapy? What prompts this need to get some kind of aesthetic *fix*, in all senses of that word? Who functions as an expert? And what sort of literary fiction is being written for this passionate readership?" (10)

"This culture may indeed rely on twenty-first-century technologies of scanning, storage, and downloadability, but it also draws on early-nineteenth-century notions of reading as self-transformation, filtered through late twentieth-century discourses of self-actualization, all jet-propelled by state-of-the-art forms of marketing 'aesthetic experience'." (10)

"When Oprah brings books to everyone, everyone is encouraged to make their reading intensely personal -- what's the point of reading otherwise?" (11)

"this reading culture is a hybrid of information technology and self-help discourse, fueled by high-octane Romantic humanism, all made possible through the generous sponsorship of quality consumerism." (12)

"I think this essential point can be taken further in regard to the popularization of literary reading, since it involves more than the convergence of old and new media -- it depends, just as fundamentally, on the convergence of antique and emergent notions of access, artistic genius, reading pleasure, and personal taste." (13)

"Why this *longing* for the literary experience within an audience of amateur readers? What sort of personalized literacy circulates within this novel and across its readership? And why does that personalization make literary reading such a vital form of popular culture?" (14)

On the NEA's "Reading on the Rise":  "the report attributes nothing to the massive transformation in the culture of reading that has occurred over the past decade in terms of where and how readers now access their literary experiences (in a variety of different interdependent media), why they feel empowered to make literary reading *their own*, or why they would be drawn to literary reading as a favorite leisure-time activity." (16)

"I have no interest in measuring the effects of the mass media on reading as some kind of instrumental tool that might increase the number of readers in the United States a few percentage points.  That sort of approach, in which mass media becomes a good thing if they lead viewers to genuine cultural pleasures, would only perpetuate all the old dichotomies between mass culture and high culture that grow ever more antiquated." (16-17)

"How has the experience of literary work become a form of popular visual entertainment? And how can we hope that the habit of literary reading will survive if it doesn't?" (17)

"The conflicts between opposing definitions of what constitutes cultural or critical literacy continue to invest the word 'literacy' with a host of preconceptions about what should or shouldn't be learned, by practically everyone, at virtually any age level.  I want to come at the question of literacy from another angle -- what does the transformation of certain forms of literary reading into popular culture suggest about popular literacy, specifically in terms of what readers are now lead [sic] to believe they need to know in order to be culturally literate, not by E.D. Hirsch any company, but by television book clubs, superstore bookshops, mall movie adaptations, and literary bestsellers?" (18)

"to conceive of Barnes & Noble, Amazon.com, Miramax, and Oprah Winfrey's Book Club as merely further expansions of middle-brow culture is to fail to recognize just how fundamentally the United States has changed during the past decade." (18-19)

"Where the Book-of-the-Month Club depended on the identification and promotion of a new class of fiction that could be offered as *good reads* distinctively apart from literary fiction, popular literary culture refunctions the literary novel as a *good read*, insisting that the appreciation of top-shelf fiction, whether it be canonical or contemporary, is possible for the general reader -- it's all in how you read them, or, more precisely, what you read them *for*.  By the late nineties, literary taste brokers could present themselves as superior to an academy that could no simply be ignored..." (19)

"The popularization of literary reading depends as much on shifts in cultural authority as it does on changes within culture industries." (19)

"the robust self-confidence enjoyed by amateur readers could only have occurred during a time when there was a profound loss of faith in professional readers, a loss of confidence in traditional literary authority to say much of anything useful about the joys of reading." (20)

reading of modernist scholarly approaches to literary reading as creating a sort of priesthood

on Harold Bloom's /How to Read and Why/: "In order to be what Bloom calls an 'authentic reader,' an academic initiation process is no longer necessary, because 'the way we read now partly depends upon our distance, inner or outer, from universities, where reading is scarcely taught as a pleasure, in any of the deeper senses of the aesthetics of pleasure'.  The villains in this piece are professors, characterized here as a priesthood run amuck" (22)

"For Bloom, loving literature means you must first reject the idea that the theory-besotted academy might retain any kind of authority whatsoever when it comes to knowing why you read literary works.  Within this scenario, amateur and professional readers cannot simply coexist, each in pursuit of their reading pleasures.  Literary authority is a zero-sum game -- apparently amateur, personal reading cannot lead to transcendent experience as long as the academy retains any shred of validity." (23)

"It does not take a French theorist, or a militant feminist critic, to see a pattern here -- novelists insisting on the need to rescue literature from evil critics by asserting the power of the author, to whom readers must submit absolutely if they ever want to really love literature or another human being." (27)

"a new *secularized* conversation about books has changed the power relations within the triangular relationship between author, critic, and reader far more expansively than any of the internecine warfare within traditional literary culture, because in this conversation readers are capable of becoming authors of their own reading pleasure (assuming the right sort of instruction).
     Within this radically secularized conversation, the new cast of curators and readers talk about books in ways that are meaningful to amateur readers and have the media technologies at their disposal to make their conversations into robust forms of popular entertainment in the form of television book clubs, the Listmania scene at Amazon.com, or a new wave of guidebooks for amateur readers..." (28-29)

"Ironically, one of the central tenets of the demonized French theory was that the pleasure of the text was not there in the 'work itself' but was produced by the act of reading -- the reader was an equal player in making the text meaningful and pleasurable." (30)

"the absence of physical boundaries has led to the creation of elaborate taste distinctions sanctioned by authorities who, to use Pierre Bourdieu's term, *consecrate* certain forms of consumer activity as cultural pleasures." (32)

"popular literary culture depends on the development of another field *between* restricted and large-scale production, in which the delivery systems for literary experiences become increasingly large-scale, but the mechanisms of taste distinction appear to grow ever more intimate as reading taste becomes ever more personalized." (33)

"This passionate reading, this longing for literacy, is obviously animated by some sort of self-cultivation project, because it isn't compulsory homework -- but where does this urge come from, and how can we begin to describe it in ways that go beyond banal generalizations? And if all this occurs outside the realm traditionally sanctioned for the proper appreciation of things aesthetic, just where does it take place? And how have the publishing, television, film, and computer industries transformed that desire for self-cultivation into an extremely lucrative market?" (35)


Part I: The New Infrastructure of Reading: Sites, Delivery Systems, Authorities

1. The End of Civilization (or at Least Civilized Reading) As You Know It: Barnes & Noble, Amazon.com, and Self-Cultivation

"Struggling but devastatingly attractive bookstore owners seem to have replaced the starving young artist as the epitome of romantic cultural chic, embodying a sweet, but nonetheless, comical earnestness in their disdain of the marketplace for the pursuit of higher cultural ideals." (40-41)

"These [common/avid/passionate] readers may be described, with equal accuracy, as a target audience, a reading community with its own interpretive protocols, and a reading formation.  I believe that it is only by incorporating all three of these alternative definitions that we can learn just who is doing this reading, for what purposes, talking what sort of literary talk, catered to by what new delivery systems, and guided by which cultural authorities." (43)

"these are relentlessly personal reading, in the sense that books take on value only when they are introjected into the lives of readers... But 'personal' does not mean solitary, or isolated. Because of their relative independence from academic modes of literary analysis, these textual communities, then, are also distinct interpretive communities that give reading literary fiction a particular use value." (44)

Tony Bennett's notion of the "reading formation" suggests that the community "is not just an audience or a community but a set of interconnections in which the desire for a certain kind of reading pleasure becomes hardwired into a literary culture" (45)

"Steven Johnson has used the term 'curatorial culture' to describe the importance of the chooser/repackager within the world of online music file accessing, the refined sensibility that sorts through the excess and is able to deliver what 'they know you'll like'" (45)

"Is this search for the necessary expertise just a traditional form of connoisseurship, being made available by emergent information technologies, or is this a twenty-first-century form of connoisseurship that depends on new technologies of access and new technologies of taste acquisition that empower amateur readers, listeners, and viewers to assume the role of curators of their own archives?" (46)

history of the acquisition of culture over the last two centuries: from something to which one had to be born to something that could be purchased

"The acquisition of cultivation that became possible for a rapidly expanding middle-class audience in the nineteenth century depended on making culture into commodity forms that could be purchased by the people who, in effect, had no attics -- to become cultured inevitably meant becoming a consumer of cultural goods one didn't already possess." (47)

"Once uncoupled from inherited wealth, the acquisition of culture had to be monitored according to a moral economy that could allow for consumerism but only by recasting it within the terms of a self-cultivation project grounded in the pursuit of 'character' untainted by the demands of the marketplace." (48)

"Self-cultivation had become a popular phenomenon by the middle of the century because of two interdependent booms -- one in publishing and the another [sic] in the dissemination of knowledge needed to realize their potential use value, whether it took the form of books about the value of reading the right books, or an elaborate public lecture system that put public oratory in support of this search for character." (48)

shift comes "during the 1920s when, as Rubin argues, *personality* replaces character, and cultivation is uncoupled form moral development." (48)

"A new set of distinctions regarding the acquisition of culture emerged, which recoupled cultivation and inherited wealth in order to avoid what were alleged to be the disastrous effects of the marketplace on the quality of both the books and the readers who consumed them." (49)

the "notion of literary work as a *commodity of a special sort*, whose self-professed dismissal of commodity relations functions, as it were, as its major selling point" (51)

"Despite, or because, of this celebration of an inherited cultured sensibility, /Orlando/ became a bestseller, outselling any other title published by Hogarth Press, a concern she ran with her husband, the author Leonard Woolf.  While Woolf may have condemned the vulgarity of the marketplace as she advocated aesthetic autonomy in her writings, her ownership of the press made that autonomy possible in material terms." (53)

"modernist notions of avant-garde purity that were fueled by a complicated, internally contradictory amalgamation of neoaristocratic and socialist values that demonized the marketplace as the root of all evil." (53)

"The academy, and more specifically English departments, managed to fashion a cultivation project that was both elitist and populist at the same time, celebrating the values of modernist literary culture but proclaiming it as somehow available to all." (53-54)

"John Guillory sums up the situation quite neatly: as students came to understand that literature was intrinsically difficult, 'they also discovered at the same moment why it needed to be studied *in the university*' (/Cultural Capital/, 172)... where it could be properly taught outside the realm of commodity relations." (54)

"Avant-gardist writing was a difficult, rigorous affair and therefore framed in masculine terms, while mass culture was rejected as easy, promiscuous,  and altogether feminine." (55)

during college, "I learned to sneer, with equal fervor, at class distinctions based on wealth, and at all of the forms of popular culture that my family had enjoyed as I was growing up... what really separated ordinary from extraordinary readers was not a matter of who loved literature passionately and who didn't.  The crucial distinction, which an entire institutionalized practice of reading endlessly reiterated, was between those who knew how to read *closely* and those who merely read, passionately or otherwise." (55-56)

"Reading, and reading professionally, seemed on the surface, at least, to be so similar that radical differentiation was required, and academic reading wasn't the sort of thing that anyone should try to do at home.  Just as medicine labored in the eighteenth century to differentiate itself from alchemy when the two appeared, to the uninformed eye, to be more or less the same thing, reading within the academy had to turn reading outside the academy into the equivalent of alchemy -- an unsystematic hodge-podge of opinion guided by irrational goals with no way of evaluating the results." (56)

"The vestigial force of both the modernist ideal of aesthetic autonomy and the concomitant sanctioning of only certain forms of cultivation is nowhere more obvious than in the demonization of the superstore bookstore -- they do indeed signal 'the end of civilization as we know it,' or at least as we were taught to know it within traditional literary culture." (56)

chain bookstores moving literacy into suburban and rural areas: "While critics of the superstores deplore the standardization that comes with the chains, this threat of decentralization is in fact the more disruptive one to traditional literary culture." (57)

"What does indeed happen to literary culture when it goes to the mall, or shows up on the strip, especially in locations where no literary scene of any sort has ever existed before? Why do these stores generate such friction in terms of how we evaluate them?" (58-59)

"The monumentality of the superstore involves a library effect, which leads shopper-patrons to use them as substitutes for lending libraries, one of the original bastions of not-for-profit culture intended for the general public.  The emergence of this library effect within the superstore environment represents an unprecedented hybrid of culture and commerce as a site designed for commerce at its most corporate but used as though it were a gift from a philanthropist." (61)

"Ironically, the ambiance cultivated by the superstore has made reading something that one goes to *do* in a bookstore." (62)

"'Literariness,' within high-tech information culture, is signified by an amalgamation of neo-aestheticist styles prominent when print was still the only medium of cultured exchange, a time when distinctions between high-brow and middle-brow were first being hardwired into the system of American culture." (64)

superstore newsletters and book prizes "address not potential buyers so much as a community of book lovers." (67)

Amazon, the "culture of metrics," and the tensions between editorial and marketing (68)

"This move to personalization was the end of the equilibrium between the editors and the MBAs, because it introduced a new set of voices, namely customers, who were encouraged to provide their own reviews." (69)

Amazon's fiction editor's dismissal of popular reviews on the site

"Discrimination and taste may have nothing to do with numbers, but they have a lot to do with who presumes to be able to have an opinion about books" (70)

"Literary authority here resides within the imagined community, rather than coming down from above, even while it celebrates the transcendent nature of a literary text as something far beyond the realm of mere bestsellers." (71-72)

relationship of Amazon listmaniacs to fan culture: "These fans exist to make taste distinctions, to demonstrate their expertise not about what is perceived to be a cult phenomenon such as playing a particular video game but to take possession of canonical literary masterpieces in the most public domain. They articulate their own identities not through role playing but by insisting on their singularity as reader-connoisseurs." (72)

"The tension is not between experiential and aesthetic reading as such, or between intellectual and ordinary readers as such, because the list makers at Amazon are intellectual (no matter how ironic they may be about it, they're college-educated, informed, avid readers) and they are clearly in search of aesthetic experience.  But what makes a book so transcendent that it removes the reader from the flux of day-to-day life into some other realm of experience depends on its experiential use value." (75-76)

"One could argue that reading and evaluating have obviously always been interdependent pleasures, but the desire to make those evaluations public in actual reading groups or via Amazon's virtual reading communities makes it abundantly clear that the need to demonstrate one's personal taste in terms of the books one chooses forms an essential part of the pleasures of reading." (78)

"While the terms 'high-brow' and 'middle-brow' still circulate throughout American popular discourse, they seem at best vestigial expressions of an earlier time, used most often from above and in a negative, disdainful way to reject a particular book or film." (78)

multiplicity of conflicting taste cultures not hierarchical but parallel

"If any figure is going to emerge as a taste maker on an international scale within this world of frenetic popular connoisseurship, that person would have to have massive reach in terms of media exposure, and would also have to be able to talk the talk of reading pleasure in a way that would establish him or her as an authority, and at the same time, still be completely of that community of amateur readers. And that person could have no vested interest in the selling of books whatsoever in order to function like a national librarian." (79)


2.  Book Clubs, Book Lust, and National Librarians: Literary Connoisseurship as Popular Entertainment

"charting the new locations of literary authority in the United States involves more than just moving the pins on the map from one coast to the other. The most striking change in this new cartography of literary taste making is where that expertise is now located and readily accessed -- deep in the heart of electronic culture." (81)

"a mini-industry in guidebooks about the pleasures of reading." (82)

"As cross-media phenomena they exemplify perfectly the way authority functions in what has come to be called convergence culture. At the same time, paradoxically, they represent a countervailing trend within the heart of that convergence -- the celebration of the absolute singularity of reading as a transformative cultural activity that can occur only in books and nowhere else in the hypermediated cultures where that reading takes place." (82)

"two media celebrities who, in very different venues, have managed to combine those characteristics so successfully that they have come to function as national librarians -- Nancy Pearl, reading adviser for National Public Radio, and Oprah Winfrey and her famous Book Club that appears regularly on her Web site and syndicated television program." (83)

Nancy Pearl on why she reads: "Because I am incurably interested in the lives of other people, both friends and strangers, I read to meet myriad folks and enter into their lives -- for me a way of vanquishing the 'otherness' we all experience." (qtd on 83) -- but should "vanquishing" that otherness be the goal? That's an awfully colonial-sounding project.  Better perhaps to think of experiencing otherness, recognizing the tensions it presents for us, the necessity of opening oneself to it and yet the impossibility of closing that gap?

spiritualization of pleasure to be found in reading

"My chief concern in this chapter will not be the sales figures but the way Oprah functions as the preeminent national librarian, seemingly outside the realm of commerce" (87)

"Like the local librarian, she recommends books as choices, not products, as expressions of taste, not mere commerce, and therefore she can be trusted implicitly.  She chooses these books because she loves them and knows you will too." (87)

"The success of Oprah as the consummate reliable authority, however, depends on more than her ability to pick appropriate titles.  She also provides a way of talking about literary titles that is nonacademic but thoroughly self-confident, thereby empowering readers to read and talk about her selections without performance anxiety." (88)

"television chat show book clubs and reading group discussions that make the reading activity into an explicitly communal interchange, dependent upon someone properly initiated to solve the mysteries hidden in the literary text" (89) -- I agree with the first part of that characterization but not the second; I don't think Oprah's audience is quite so beholden to her as a guide as this sounds

"Having been initiated into the mysteries of the Word, Winfrey takes the message to her viewers and provides a way of talking the talk of reading that renders the formerly opaque into the transparently meaningful, and the mysterious becomes transparent." (89)

"The book talk here is alternately deeply sincere and blithely ironic, with the tone changing practically every other sentence, and often within the same sentence, as if the assertion of seriousness about reading must come with near instantaneous disclaimer, only to be reasserted again almost immediately." (92)

"The incorporation of footage from the /Masterpiece Theatre/ production, combined with this voice-over, sums up the Oprah Book Club like an epigram, because the reading experience is visualized two times over -- we watch a television production of the novel within another television show dedicated to the successful reading of the novel." (94)

"Oprah is a full-service oral performer, selecting the books, narrating the story, providing 'handy-dandy reading strategies,' acting as our good-will ambassador to the world in need of books, even designing the right clothes to wear while reading those selections." (97)

relationship of OBC to "bibliotherapy" (and bibliotherapy as a peculiarly US phenomenon)

comparison of Oprah with Martha Stewart, as taste-maker: "while Stewart is there *with* you, televisually speaking she's not one of *us*, for her superiority is never in doubt; she has deigned to share her secrets with viewers, but those power relations remain firmly in place" (103)

"her conflict with Jonathan Franzen became a kind of national referendum on the legitimacy of popular literary culture in the United States" (104)

"What was at stake in the controversy, at the most fundamental level, was just who literary culture belonged to, who could function as its experts, and who got to be a player in the game of serious reading" (105)

"Miller feels that it is unfortunate that the two book cultures cannot overcome their mutual animosity, but their mutual disrespect is inevitable, given the mutually incommensurable nature of these metanarratives of reading." (110)

"Many of the factors associated with the reading of literary fiction, as opposed to popular visual media, were now being detached from literary experience and transferred to texts coming from the heart of that visual culture; that is, texts that demanded close reading possessed the density to justify repeated readings, and also required the specialized knowledge that cam with professionalized reading." (113-14)

"What is the relationship between print and visual culture in terms of what now constitutes a 'literary experience'? And dow *does* taste culture determine what counts as quality reading and what is recognized as quality writing?" (114)


Part II: The Literary Experience in Visual Cultures

3. The *Movie* Was Better: The Rise of the Cine-Literary

"The seamless, simultaneous, interconnection of novel, film, featurette, Web site, and digital reading device is the foundation of cine-literary culture, and within this culture, reading the book has become only one of a host of interlocking literary experiences." (119)

"The adaptation mania that exploded in the nineties, and that appears to be only intensifying a decade or more later, depends on the reconfiguration of those pleasures in an expansive 'cine-bibliophilia' that could be 'authorized' only be realignments in taste cultures that suggest profound changes in the relative status of both reading and watching." (120)

"While the fidelity approach makes the intentions of the author the foundation of the adaptation process, I will examine how the author is used to *authorize* a host of pleasures that complicate the simple transfer from page to screen." (122)

"if there is anything academic film study has avoided more strenuously than the adaptation film it is the entire category of taste" (122)

"By making taste a category akin to alchemy or some kind of black magic outside the discipline (or more specifically, the discursive formation that became a university education in film), the war of legitimation was won, but the vestiges of that victory have come to haunt the discipline in the form of intellectual class prejudices that foreclose certain ways of making sense of film as popular culture." (123)

roots of literary/cinematic adaptation practices in the need to produce "high-class educational pictures" in response to public censuring of nickelodeons

"The promotion of the adaptation during this period reflects a complicated interplay between financial and cultural capital.  During this period, 'high culture' was being marked off as such by cultural entrepreneurs who were determined to preserve it by moving it out of the realm of the marketplace." (124)

"When Hollywood faced another sort of image crisis in the early thirties, for its alleged sensationalizing of crime and sexuality, it responded with internal censorship in the form of the Hays Office, but also with a renewed emphasis on literary adaptations." (125)

waxing and waning of anglophilia in cinematic/literary culture: in the "cinephile taste cartography" of the 1970s, "Jane Austen, E.M. Forster, and company exemplified the sort of antiquated social and intellectual class distinctions that had to be rejected in order for a popular, visual medium to gain ascendancy as a medium of genuine culture" (128)

"This declaration of independence from the literary, specifically the rejection of anything that suggested that film needed to go to literature to acquire prestige, was also a vital component of the professionalization of film studies within the academy." (128)

"at no time in history has the adaptation been more ubiquitous, and at no time has American film studies been so poorly prepared to make sense of the causes, functions, or ramifications of this phenomenon." (129)

"What has occurred within American film culture, in terms of industry infrastructure and in terms of broader shifts in popular taste, for the adaptation to experience this unprecedented level of popularity? What has led to not just the use, but the near domination of literary prototypes with the category of the prestige picture? What happens, at the most fundamental level, to the relationship between film culture and literary culture when that occurs?" (130)

of Merchant-Ivory: "The appeal of these films for an American audience can be attributed to another crisis -- the realization that their expensive college educations have failed to provide the lessons in taste that they need to pursue upward mobility." (136)

"the finishing school of quality popular culture" (136)

"Just as the bestseller status of Tolstoy and Faulkner novels may be attributed to the ways in which they have been redefined by Oprah Winfrey's Book Club, the cinematic versions of Austen and James novels represent a comparable reframing that changes the picture quite drastically -- they *are* different novels, and not just because they have been transformed into images.  They are different experiences now that they've been given value within a particular taste culture." (137)

"The academy had sidelined itself by defining educated reading in terms of the appreciation of an author's vision or as a manifestation of a particular set of gender and class relations." (137)

"The legitimation of film study, in both the American and the British academies, could not have been accomplished without challenging the literary as the international gold standard of cultural capital.  Yet the inevitability of that challenge should not blind film studies to the fact that its institutionalization as a discipline was to a great extent the result of a taste war, a back story that can no longer be ignored, now that the vestiges of those conflicts have reemerged in the form of the high-profile literary adaptations that have become the dominant form of prestige picture for the past decade." (138-39)


4. "Miramaxing": Beyond Mere Adaptation

"Just as Amazon listmaniacs and television book clubs insist on their legitimacy within the realm of literary culture through their dedication to the love of literature, Miramax successfully realized a film version of that same passion by making the love of literature into one of its stable products -- products paradoxically made profitable through the use of strategies developed within the world of high-concept filmmaking, formerly considered to be the virtual antithesis of all things truly literary." (142)

"Miramax positioned itself as a counterattraction to the Industry, but only by taking the art house film (which was as close to quality nonprofit culture as cinema could get in the United States) out of that realm directly into the marketplace, namely, the multiplex." (144-45)

"The high-concept adaptation that Miramax hybridized so successfully depended on the combination of things thought to be not just mutually exclusive, but mutually antagonistic within the dominant taste categories of American culture.... perhaps the most important hybridization of what was formerly considered antagonistic is the way these films manage to radiate a quality *cultural* experience while being so intensively *marketed*.... In the case of Miramax, this was founded on two interdependent combinations -- the intertwining of sexual passion with a passion for the literary experience, and the collapsing of film company and audience into a shared community of book lovers." (149)

"For Miramax to fill out the quadrant sufficiently for a literary prestige picture to become a box office smash, taste cultures that might otherwise view each other antagonistically had to be encouraged to not just enjoy the same film but somehow regard it as *their own*." (159-60)

reading of the shifting location of the literary in the novel/film adaptation of /The English Patient/

"By combining the factory and the boutique, Miramax gave its audience what it expects in a world of 'good-design' chainstores, superstore bookstores, and Starbucks cafés -- increasingly easier access to what were formerly considered elite pleasures, which are carefully cultivated to retain the vestiges of exclusivity, even as they become increasingly ubiquitous." (176)

"Any sort of taste hierarchy that might have insisted on qualitative differences between the two [reading and watching] no longer holds sway -- quality reading and quality viewing have equal footing within cine-literary culture.  Because of this equal footing, 'adatation talk,' has apparently acquired an entertainment value unto itself for a quality readership/viewership." (179)


Part III: Popular Literary Fiction

5. Sex and the Post-Literary City

"The advent to chain store and Web site bookshops, high-concept literary adaptation films, and television book clubs have all changed where and how a literary experience occurs. They have also changed the ways in which one talks the talk of literary appreciation with a high degree of authority, largely by making reading a process of self-empowerment that no longer depends on acquiring the right sort of pedigree or professional training." (183)

popular novelistic representations of contemporary literary culture:  "While these novels may differ quite dramatically in terms of their literary aspirations, they all have two things in common -- first, they offer lessons in self-cultivation, now defined as an *informed consumerism* about love, culture, and material goods, and second, they make extensive use of canonical novels by Trollope, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Austen, James, Wharton, Forster, Alcott, and Charlotte Brontë as they very self-consciously reinvent the novel of manners for contemporary audiences." (186)

"here I want to explore the spectrum of quality fiction rather than make categorical distinctions about what is, and isn't, a literary bestseller, because it is the fluidity of this continuum that is most significant.  In this chapter, I provide a kind of tracking shot across popular literary culture, a scene filled with masses of readers who read quality fiction passionately, a publishing industry who caters to them just as lustily, and legions of novelists who are determined to prove the value of their novels for audiences in search of quality reading that will provide useful information."

the "Post-Literary Novel" versus the "Devoutly Literary Novel"

"the post-literary novel dismisses the avowedly literary in pursuit of a new kind of quality fiction, while the devoutly literary sanctifies the reading experience, but in doing so turns the most 'bookish' sorts of pleasures into the stuff of literary bestsellers." (188)

"The post-literary novels of manners I will be focusing on in this chapter all position themselves in a popular literary culture of their own creation, solidly ensconced between the realms of vulgar bestsellers and irrelevant serious fiction.... Literary authors may be impressive in some abstract sense within another taste culture, but they are unreadable, because they have no direct application in terms of offering advice about herself or her relationships." (191)

Michael Woods, /Literature and the Taste for Knowledge/ (2005): "in his introduction he makes a key point about the taste for knowledge that literary fiction offers: it can teach us certain things about the 'complexity of the world' in terms of ambiguities and 'obliquity' not available in other forms of discourse" (197)

"The discourse here is unashamedly therapeutic -- the novel's value is measured in terms of self-actualization: reading it makes us more fully ourselves." (199)

"When the Great American Author becomes the Great American Curator/Consumer, taste distinctions must be recorded time and time again, because they are, in effect, where the action is in terms of self-definition." (201)

"These oppositions between craft and identification, between reading as knowledge acquisition and reading as quality self-actualization, are at the center of the turf war over literary fiction" (216)

"the passionate reading that fuels the popular literary and allegedly sets it apart from the professionalized reading of academics and literary critics depends on more than the savoring of distinctive prose styles.  That being said, passionate reading of the wrong books (only 'ostensibly literary' books, for example) disqualifies all that passionate reading. But when is that passion not misspent?" (217)

"That which is called literary, then, is 'ostensibly' a matter of good writing, but also really dependent upon the promise of certain pleasures, the right cultural mise-en scène [sic], formed by a relatively stable set of recurring locations and characters animated by the same desires, as well as a remarkably similar set of sensibilities shared by novelists, characters, and avid readers" (22)


6. The Devoutly Literary Bestseller

"In these Devoutly Literary novels the act of reading becomes an all-sustaining pleasure that is available only between the covers of a book." (223)

"literary reading now comes with its own self-legitimating mythology that sanctifies the singularity of reading novels as an aesthetic experience, the way they *used* to be read, yet these same novels become global bestsellers only through the intervention of popular literary culture." (224-25)

"It is one thing to ponder whether watching Oprah's Book Club is an aesthetic experience, but quite another when we take up novels that insist, in no uncertain terms, that reading them will be a firsthand encounter with *beauty*.  How are these aesthetic experiences marked off as such? And why have they become so marketable?" (226)

"This sort of effaced consumerism that makes the pursuit of aesthetic experience something that may be explicitly advertised as such, without invalidating the experience, had to be solidly in place for the literary bestseller to thrive as a superior form of quality reading within the past decade." (236)

"a taste for things literary and things of a more material nature (furniture, houses, clothing) are no longer mutually exclusive but wholly interdependent pleasures" (236)

"Writing and reading literary fiction is not just foregrounded as one of the finer things in life -- it is woven into an entire web of interdependent aesthetic pleasures that form both the action and stage set for the quality literary experience, both within the novels and in the domestic space of the reading of those books." (237)

neo-aestheticism in affordable design movement, etc.

"what is at play here is the massification of elite tastes made possible by the mass production of goods and the mass dissemination of a new way of talking the talk of aesthetic appreciation, in which the aesthetic experience becomes explicitly designated as such" (243)

"Given the interplay between aestheticism and its marketability, it is not surprising that literary fiction has become a form of category fiction.  This transformation is, in part, attributable to the ways in which publishers now target quality audiences and present certain novels as books to be read for exactly those readers.  But it is also attributable to a remarkable consistency in the fictional worlds created and the pleasures that are offered there." (246)

"The readership of the Devoutly Literary novel doesn't *need* McEwan in the way that readers might need Roddy Doyle.  It's not a matter of needing instruction as much as of finding a kindred spirit who shares your sensibilities and believes in the power of reading." (247)

"My goal in demonstrating how these contemporary self-conscious literary novels resemble genre fiction more than metafiction is not to diminish either the quality of the writing or the quality of the pleasures they generate. But reading pleasure here is not some all-purpose pleasure of the text, or hymn to the joys of solitary reading; the exchange between this particular sort of literary novel and its readers is all about the celebration of an imagined reading community" (252-53)

"One of the most significant differences between the aesthetic writing of a century ago and contemporary neo-aesthetic novels is that the former was determined to make the reading of the text an intense aesthetic experience unto itself through flamboyantly 'artful' stylistic strategies, where the latter depicts characters having such experiences, in prose styles that feature anything but such stylistic virtuosity." (254)

"We are shown people enjoying the pleasures of reading, but the book we hold in our hands offers little more than the literary equivalent of these paintings -- the words only depict aesthetic pleasure felt by others, resulting in a bizarre pornography of reading in which pleasure comes from watching others lost in the pleasure of reading really great novels or looking at really great paintings." (254)

incredible description of "book binges" on p. 257: clearly preparation for sex-with-book; what makes me wonder is WHY -- again, as with the anxiety of obsolescence, cui bono? clearly there's some desire to make the work of the novelist desirable...

on perverse quotation of Julian Barnes in one of these novels: "In Barnes's novel, the 'book talk' never stops, but what literary reading fails to accomplish is detailed as extensively as what it might deliver in the best of circumstances.  In a Lit-lit novel like /Literacy and Longing in L.A./ there is only unequivocal celebration of literary reading, in which book talk becomes endless recommendation." (259)

"Lit-lit represents a thorough-going incorporation of reading into the textures of day-to-day life, a world where reading has indeed become part of the furniture.  And as such, it may well represent the best chance for literary reading to become the sort of lifelong activity that teachers and professors of English can only hope to inspire.
     So that's all to the good, right? Indeed it is, but there are also things about the Lit-lit phenomenon that are just as disturbing in regard to the future of reading literary fiction." (263)
 
"The best-friend coziness factor becomes especially pernicious when it is built on an ideology of reading that insists that the transformative power of words is available to all, but is really appreciated only by we few, we happy, tasteful few, who already know that power." (264)

"The imperiled clubbiness of the Devoutly Literary may consolidate a community of readers by validating their shared sensibilities, but it comes with an enormous risk -- that potential readers may not answer the call because they don't want to affiliate with a club that gives no validity to any aspect of their cultural life other than literary reading." (265)

-- the book desperately needs a conclusion; instead we get two paragraphs of "this is the way it is: pop culture and the literary, mixing!"
