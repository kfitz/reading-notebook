Barthes, Roland. The Pleasure of the Text. New York: Hill and Wang, 1975.

"A Note on the Text" -- Richard Howard (v-viii)

"the French have a vocabulary of eroticism, an amorous discourse which smells neither of the laboratory nor of the sewer, which just -- attentively, scrupulously -- puts the facts.  In English, we have either the coarse or the clinical, and by tradition our words for our pleasures, even for the intimate parts of our bodies where we may take those pleasures, come awkwardly when they come at all" (Howard v)

"Pleasure is a state, bliss (*jouissance*) an action, and both of them, in our culture, are held to be unspeakable, beyond words" (Howard vi)

"the design [of Barthes's book] is the simply staging of the question 'What do we enjoy in the text?'" (Howard vii)

"determined to affirm the pleasure we must take in our reading as against the indifference of (mere) knowledge, determined to instance our ecstasy, our bliss in the text against the prudery of ideological analysis, so that perhaps for the first time in the history of criticism we have not only a poetics of reading... but a much more difficult (because supposedly inexpressible, apparently ineffable) achievement:  *an erotics of reading*" (Howard vii-viii)


imagine someone who could endure every form of contradiction:  "Now this anti-hero exists:  he is he reader of the text at the moment he takes his pleasure" (Barthes 3)

"the text of pleasure is a sanctioned Babel" (Barthes 4)

on the distinction between plaisir and jouissance:  "terminologically, there is always a vacillation -- I stumble, I err.  In any case, there will always be a margin of indecision; the distinction will not be the source of absolute classifications, the paradigm will falter, the meaning will be precarious, revocable, reversible, the discourse incomplete" (Barthes 4)

"Does writing in pleasure guarantee -- guarantee me, the writer -- my reader's pleasure?  Not at all.  I must seek out this reader (must 'cruise' him) *without knowing where he is.*  A site of bliss is then created.  It is not the reader's 'person' that is necessary to me, it is this site: the possibility of a dialectics of desire, of an *unpredictability* of bliss" (Barthes 4)

of the author of a text:  "You address yourself to me so that I may read you, but I am nothing to you except this address.... It can be said that after all you have written this text quite apart from bliss; and this prattling text is then a frigid text, as any demand is frigid until desire, until neurosis forms in it" (Barthes 5)

"Neurosis is a makeshift... but this makeshift is the only one that allows for writing (and reading)" (Barthes 5)

"Thus every writer's motto reads: *mad I cannot be, sane I do not deign to be, neurotic I am*" (Barthes 6)

"The text you write must prove to me *that it desires me*" (Barthes 6)

redistribution of the text created by "cutting":  "Two edges are created: an obedient, conformist, plagiarizing edge... and *another edge*, mobile, blank (ready to assume any contours), which is never anything but the site of its effect: the place where the death of language is glimpsed" (Barthes 6)

"Neither culture nor its destruction is erotic; it is the seam between them, the fault, the flaw, which becomes so" (Barthes 7)

"Whence, perhaps, a means of evaluating the works of our modernity: their value would proceed from their duplicity.  By which it must be understood that they always have two edges" (Barthes 7)

"what pleasure wants is the site of a loss, the seam, the cut, the deflation, the *dissolve* which seizes the subject in the midst of bliss.  Culture thus recurs as an edge: in no matter what form" (Barthes 7)

"The dismantling of language is intersected by political assertion, is *edged* by the age-old culture of the signifier" (Barthes 8)

"all the signifiers are here and each scores a bull's-eye; the author (the reader) seems to say to them: *I love you all* (words, phrases, sentences, adjectives, discontinuities: pell-mell: signs and mirages of objects which they represent)" (Barthes 8)

"the pledge of continuous jubilation, the moment when by its very excess verbal pleasure chokes and reels into bliss" (Barthes 8)

"with Flaubert, for the first time, discontinuity is no longer exceptional, sporadic, brilliant, set in the base matter of common utterance" (Barthes 9)

"This is a very subtle and nearly untenable status for discourse: narrativity is dismantled yet the story is still readable: never have the two edges of the seam been clearer and more tenuous, never has pleasure been better offered to the reader" (Barthes 9)

"Is not the most erotic portion of a body *where the garment gapes*? In perversion (which is the realm of textual pleasure) there are no 'erogenous zones' (a foolish expression, besides); it is intermittence, as psychoanalysis has so rightly stated, which is erotic... it is this flash itself which seduces, or rather: the staging of an appearance-as-disappearance" (Barthes 9-10)

"The pleasure of the text is not the pleasure of the corporeal striptease or of narrative suspense.  In these cases, there is no tear, no edges: a gradual unveiling: the entire excitation takes refuge in the *hope* of seeing the sexual organ (schoolboy's dream) or in knowing the end of the story (novelistic satisfaction).  Paradoxically (since it is mass-consumed), this is a far more intellectual pleasure than the other: an Oedipal pleasure" (Barthes 10)

"our very avidity for knowledge impels us to skim or skip certain passages (anticipated as 'boring') in order to get more quickly to the warmer parts of the anecdote (which are always its articulations: whatever furthers the solution of the riddle, the revelation of fate): we boldly skip (no one is watching) descriptions, explanations, analyses, conversations; doing so, we resemble a spectator in a nightclub who climbs onto the stage and speeds up the dancer's striptease, tearing off her clothing, *but in the same order*, that is: on the one hand respecting and on the other hastening the episodes of the ritual" (Barthes 11)

"the author cannot predict tmesis: he cannot choose to write *what will not be read*.  And yet, it is the very rhythm of what is read and what is not read that creates the pleasure of the great narratives" (Barthes 11)

"Thus, what I enjoy in a narrative is not directly its content or even its structure, but rather the abrasions I impose upon the fine surface: I read on, I skip, I look up, I dip in again" (Barthes 11-12)

"Whence two systems of reading: one goes straight to the articulations of the anecdote, it considers the extent of the text, ignores the play of language... the other reading skips nothing; it weighs, it sticks to the text, it reads, so to speak, with application and transport, grasps at every point in the text the asyndeton which cuts the various languages" (Barthes 12)

"Now paradoxically (so strong is the belief that one need merely *go fast* in order not to be bored), this second, *applied* reading (in the real sense of the word 'application') is the one suited to the modern text, the limit-text.  Read slowly, read *all* of a novel by Zola, and the book will drop from your hands; read fast, in snatches, some modern next, and it becomes opaque, inaccessible to your pleasure" (Barthes 12)

"*what happens to the language does not happen to the discourse*" (Barthes 13)

"If I agree to judge a text according to pleasure, I cannot go on to say: this one is good, that bad.  No awards, no 'critique,' for this always implies a tactical aim, a social usage, and frequently an extenuating image-reservoir.... the text (the same is true of the singing voice) can wring from me only this judgment, in no way adjectival: *that's it!*  And further still:  *that's it for me!*" (Barthes 13)

"The *brio* of the text (without which, after all, there is no text) is its *will to bliss*" (Barthes 13)

"Text of pleasure: the text that contents, fills, grants euphoria; the text that comes from culture and does not break with it, is linked to a *comfortable* practice of reading.  Text of bliss:  the text that imposes a state of loss, the text that discomforts (perhaps to the point of a certain boredom), unsettles the reader's historical, cultural, psychological assumptions, the consistency of his tastes, values, memories, brings to a crisis his relation with language" (Barthes 14)

the reader "enjoys the consistency of his selfhood (that is his pleasure) and seeks its loss (that is his bliss).  He is a subject split twice over, doubly perverse" (Barthes 14)

"Conflict is nothing but the moral state of difference; whenever (and this is becoming frequent) conflict is not tactical (aimed at transforming a real situation), one can distinguish in it the failure-to-attain-bliss, the debacle of a perversion crushed by its own code and no longer able to invent itself: conflict is always coded, aggression is merely the most worn-out of languages" (Barthes 15)

"On the stage of the text, no footlights: there is not, behind the text, someone active (the writer) and out front someone passive (the reader); there is not a subject and an object" (Barthes 16)

"Does the text have human form, is it a figure, an anagram of the body?  Yes, but of our erotic body.  The pleasure of the text is irreducible to physiological need" (Barthes 17)

"The pleasure of the text is that moment when my body pursues its own ideas -- for my body does not have the same ideas I do" (Barthes 17)

"How can we take pleasure in a *reported* pleasure (boredom of all narratives of dreams, of parties)?  How can we read criticism?  Only one way: since I am here a second-degree reader, I must shift my position:  instead of agreeing to be confidant of this critical pleasure -- a sure way to miss it -- I can make myself its voyeur: I observe clandestinely the pleasure of others, I enter a perversion; the commentary then becomes in my eyes a text, a fiction, a fissured envelope" (Barthes 17)

"*Pleasure of the text, text of pleasure*: these expressions are ambiguous because French has no word that simultaneously covers pleasure (contentment) and bliss (rapture).  Therefore, 'pleasure' here (and without our being able to anticipate) sometimes extends to bliss, sometimes is opposed to it.  But I must accommodate myself to this ambiguity; for on the one hand I need a general 'pleasure' whenever I must refer to an excess of the text, to what in it exceeds any (social) function and and (structural) functioning; and on the other, I need a particular 'pleasure,' a simple part of Pleasure as a whole, whenever I need to distinguish euphoria, fulfillment, comfort (the feeling of repletion when culture penetrates freely), from shock, disturbance, even loss, which are proper to ecstasy, to bliss" (Barthes 19)

"Is pleasure only a minor bliss?  Is bliss nothing but extreme pleasure?  Is pleasure only a weakened, conformist bliss -- a bliss deflected through a pattern of conciliations?  Is bliss merely a brutal, immediate (without mediation) pleasure?  On the answer (yes or no) depends the way in which we shall write the history of our modernity.  For if I say that between pleasure and bliss there is only a difference of degree, I am also saying that the history is a pacified one: the text of bliss is merely the logical, organic, historical development of the text of pleasure; the avant-garde is never anything but the progressive, emancipated form of past culture: today emerges from yesterday, Robbe-Grillet is already in Flaubert, Sollers in Rabelais, all of Nicolas de Stael in two square centimeters of Cézanne.  But if I believe on the contrary that pleasure and bliss are parallel forces, that they cannot meet, and that between them there is more than a struggle: an *incommunication,* then I must certainly believe that history, our history, is not peaceable and perhaps not even intelligent, that the text of bliss always arises out of it like a scandal (an irregularity), that it is always the trace of a cut, of an assertion (and not a flowering), and that the subject of this history (this historical subject that I am among others), far from being pacified by combining my taste for works of the past with my advocacy of modern works in a fine dialectical movement of synthesis -- this subject is never anything but a 'living contradiction': a split subject, who simultaneously enjoys, through the text, the consistency of his selfhood and its collapse, its fall" (Barthes 20-21)

"Here moreover, drawn from psychoanalysis, is an indirect way of establishing the opposition between the text of pleasure and the text of bliss:  pleasure can be expressed in words, bliss cannot" (Barthes 21)

"The writer of pleasure (and his reader) accepts the letter; renouncing bliss, he has the right and the power to express it:  the letter is his pleasure; he is obsessed by it, as are all those who love language" (Barthes 21)

"*criticism always deals with the texts of pleasure, never the texts of bliss*" (Barthes 21)

"With the writer of bliss (and his reader) begins the untenable text, the impossible text.  This text is outside pleasure, outside criticism, *unless it is reached through another text of bliss*" (Barthes 22)

"An entire minor mythology would have us believe that pleasure (and singularly the pleasure of the text) is a rightist notion" (Barthes 22)

"On both sides, this peculiar idea that pleasure is *simple*, which is why it is championed or disdained.  Pleasure, however, is not an *element* of the text, it is not a naive residue; it does not depend on a logic of understanding and on sensation; it is a drift, something both revolutionary and asocial, and it cannot be taken over by any collectivity, any mentality, any ideolect" (Barthes 23)

"To be with the one I love and to think of something else:  this is how I have my best ideas, how I best invent what is necessary to my work.... I am not necessarily *capitvated* by the text of pleasure; it can be an act that is slight, complex, tenuous, almost scatterbrained" (Barthes 24)

"boredom is not simple.  We do not escape boredom (with a work, a text) with a gesture of impatience or rejection" (Barthes 25)

"Boredom is not far from bliss: it is bliss seen from the shores of pleasure" (Barthes 26)

"The text is a fetish object, and *this fetish desires me*.  The text chooses me, by a whole disposition of invisible screens, selective baffles: vocabulary, references, readability, etc.; and, lost in the midst of a text (not *behind* it, like a *deus ex machina*) there is always the other, the author" (Barthes 27)

"in the text, in a way, *I desire* the author: I need his figure (which is neither his representation nor his projection), as he needs mine (except to 'prattle')" (Barthes 27)

"The pleasure of the text does not prefer one ideology to another.  *However:* this impertinence does not proceed from liberalism but from perversion: the text, its reading, are split.  What is overcome, split, is the *moral unity* that society demands of every human product" (Barthes 31)

"can it be that pleasure makes us *objective*?" (Barthes 32)

"(Commonly said: 'dominant ideology.'  This expression is incongruous.  For what is ideology?  It is precisely the idea *insofar as it dominates*: ideology can only be dominant.  Correct as it is to speak of an 'ideology of the dominant class,' because there is certainly a dominated class, it is quite inconsistent to speak of a 'dominant ideology,' because there is no dominated ideology: where the 'dominated' are concerned, there is nothing, no ideology, unless it is precisely -- and this is the last degree of alienation -- the ideology they are forced (in order to make symbols, hence in order to live) to borrow from the class that dominates them.  The social struggle cannot be reduced to the struggle between two rival ideologies: it is the subversion of all ideology which is in question.)" (Barthes 32-33)

"No 'thesis' on the pleasure of the text is possible; barely an inspection (an introspection) that falls short.  *Eppure si gaude!*  And yet, against and in spite of everything, the text gives me bliss" (Barthes 34)

"bliss is never a taking: nothing separates it from *satori*, from losing" (Barthes 35)

"Paradox:  the writer suppresses this gratuitousness of writing (which approaches, by bliss, the gratuitousness of death): he stiffens, hardens his muscles, denies the drift, represses bliss: there are very few writers who combat *both* ideological repression and libidinal repression (the kind, of course, which the intellectual brings to bear upon himself: upon his own language)" (Barthes 35)

"Which is what the inter-text is:  the impossibility of living outside the infinite text -- whether this text be Proust or the daily newspaper or the television screen:  the book creates meaning, the meaning creates life" (Barthes 36)

"If you hammer a nail into a piece of wood, the wood has a different resistance according to the place you attack it; we say that the wood is not isotropic.  Neither is the text: the edges, the seam, are unpredictable" (Barthes 36)

"I am interested in language because it wounds or seduces me.  Can that be a class eroticism?  What class?  The bourgeoisie?  The bourgeoisie has no relish for language, which it no longer regards as even a luxury, an element of the art of living (death of 'great' literature), but merely as an instrument of decor (phraseology)" (Barthes 38)

"No significance (no bliss) can occur, I am convinced, in a mass culture (to be distinguished, like fire from water, from the culture of the masses), for the model of this culture is petit bourgeois.  It is characteristic of our (historical) contradiction that significance (bliss) has taken refuge in an excessive alternative:  either in a mandaring *praxis* (result of an *extenuation* of bourgeois culture), or else in an utopian idea (the idea of a future culture, resulting from a *radical, unheard of, unpredictable* revolution, about which anyone writing today knows only one thing: that, like Moses, he will not cross over into it)" (Barthes 38-39)

"The asocial character of bliss:  it is the abrupt loss of sociality, and yet there follows no recurrence to the subject (subjectivity), the person, solitude:  *everything* is lost, integrally.  Extremity of the clandestine, darkness of the motion-picture theater" (Barthes 39)

hermeneutic modes of literary criticism ("socio-ideological analyses") ignore "the formidable underside of writing:  bliss:  bliss which can erupt, across the centuries, out of certain texts that were nonetheless written to the glory of the dreariest, of the most sinister philosophy" (Barthes 39)

"bliss may come only with the *absolutely new*, for only the new disturbs (weakens) consciousness (easy? not at all: nine times out of ten, the new is only the stereotype of novelty)" (Barthes 40)

"There is only one way left to escape the alienation of present-day society: *to retreat ahead of it*:  every old language is immediately compromised, and every language becomes old once it is repeated" (Barthes 40)

"all official institutions of language are repeating machines" (Barthes 40)

"Whence the present configuration of forces:  on the one hand, a mass banalization (linked to the repetition of language) -- a banalization outside bliss but not necessarily outside pleasure -- and on the other, a (marginal, eccentric) impulse toward the New -- a desperate impulse that can reach the point of destroying discourse: an attempt to reproduce in historical terms the bliss repressed beneath the stereotype" (Barthes 41) -- **need to think about this in relationship to blogs; blogs as a potentially revolutionary mixing of the interminally banal and the relentlessly new**

"Yet one can make a claim for precisely the opposite (though I am not the one who would make such a claim): repetition itself creates bliss.... to repeat excessively is to enter into loss, into the zero of the signified.  But:  in order for repetition to be erotic, it must be formal, literal, and in our culture this flaunted (excessive) repetition reverts to eccentricity" (Barthes 41)

"The bastard form of mass culture is humiliated repetition:  content, ideological schema, the blurring of contradictions -- these are repeated, but the superficial forms are varied:  always new books, new programs, new films, news items, but always the same meaning" (Barthes 41-42)

"The stereotype is the word repeated without any magic, any enthusiasm, as though it were natural, as though by some miracle this recurring word were adequate on each occasion for different reasons, as though to imitate could no longer be sensed as an imitation: an unconstrained word that claims consistency and is unaware of its own insistence.  Nietzsche has observed that 'truth' is only the solidification of old metaphors.  So in this regard the stereotype is the present path of 'truth,' the palpable feature which shifts the invented ornament to the canonical, constraining form of the signified" (Barthes 42)

"Another bliss (other edges):  it consists in de-politicizing what is apparently political, and in politicizing what apparently is not. --Come now, surely one politicizes what *must* be politicized, and that's all" (Barthes 44)

"the text *does not give names* -- or it removes existing ones... the text undoes nomination, and it is this defection which approaches bliss" (Barthes 44-45)

"*That's it!*  This cry is not to be understood as an illumination of the intelligence, but as the very limit of nomination, of the imagination" (Barthes 45)

"One out of every two Frenchmen, it appears, does not read; half of France is deprived -- deprives itself of the pleasure of the text.  Now this national disgrace is never deplored except from a humanistic point of view, as though by ignoring books the French were merely forgoing some moral good, some noble value.  It would be better to write the grim, stupid, tragic history of all the pleasures which societies object to or renounce: there is an obscurantism of pleasure" (Barthes 46)

"the foreclosure of pleasure (and even more of bliss) in a society ridden by two moralities: the prevailing one, of platitude; the minority one, of rigor (political and/or scientific).  As if the notion of pleasure no longer pleases anyone.  Our society appears to be both staid and violent; in any event: frigid" (Barthes 46-47)

"Doesn't every narrative lead back to Oedipus?" (Barthes 47)

"Today, we dismiss Oedipus and narrative at one and the same time: we no longer love, we no longer fear, we no longer narrate" (Barthes 47)

"Of all readings, that of tragedy is the most perverse: I take pleasure in hearing myself tell a story *whose end I know*:  I know and I don't know, I act toward myself as though I did not know:  I know perfectly well Oedipus will be unmasked, that Danton will be guillotined, *but all the same*... Compared to a dramatic story, which is one whose outcome is unknown, there is here an effacement of pleasure and a progression of bliss (today, in mass culture, there is an enormous consumption of 'dramatics' and little bliss)" (Barthes 47-48, ellipsis in original)

"The Sentence is hierarchical: it implies subjections, subordinations, internal relations.  Whence its completion:  how can a hierarchy remain open?  The Sentence is complete: it is even precisely that language which is complete.  Practice, here, is very different from theory.  Theory (Chomsky) says that the sentence is potentially infinite (infinitely catalyzable), but practice always obliges the sentence to end" (Barthes 50)

"it is the power of completion which defines sentence mastery and marks, as with a supreme, clearly won, conquered *savoir-faire*, the agents of the Sentence" (Barthes 50)

"A writer is not someone who expresses his thoughts, his passion, or his imagination in sentences, but *someone who thinks sentences*" (Barthes 50-51)

"The pleasure of the sentence is to a high degree cultural" (Barthes 51)

"The pleasure of the text can be defined by *praxis* (without any danger of repression).... This pleasure can be *spoken*: whence criticism" (Barthes 51)

"*Texts of pleasure*.  Pleasure in pieces; language in pieces; culture in pieces.  Such texts are perverse in that they are outside any imaginable finality -- *even that of pleasure* (bliss does not constrain to pleasure; it can even apparently inflict boredom).  No alibi stands up, nothing is reconstituted, nothing recuperated.  The text of bliss is absolutely intransitive" (Barthes 51-52)

"Everyone can testify that the pleasure of the text is not certain:  nothing says that this same text will please us a second time; it is a friable pleasure, split by mood, habit, circumstance, a precarious pleasure....  The bliss of the text is not precarious, it is worse:  *precocious*; it does not come in its own good time, it does not depend on any ripening... as soon as it is understood, the principle of loss becomes ineffective, one must go on to something else.  Everything comes about; indeed in every sense everything *comes* -- *at first glance*" (Barthes 52-53)

on the quotidian:  "Why do some people, including myself, enjoy in certain novels, biographies, and historical works the representation of the 'daily life' of an epoch, of a character?  Why this curiosity about petty details: schedules, habits, meals, lodging, clothing, etc.?  Is it the hallucinatory relish of 'reality' (the very materiality of '*that once existed*'?)  And is it not the fantasy itself which invokes the 'detail,' the tiny private scene, in which I can easily take my place?  Are there, in short, 'minor hysterics' (these very readers) who receive bliss from a singular theater: not one of grandeur but one of mediocrity (might there not be dreams, fantasies of mediocrity)?" (Barthes 53)

"Art seems compromised, historically, socially.  Whence the effort on the part of the artist himself to destroy it" (Barthes 54)

"Unfortunately, this destruction is always inadequate; either it occurs outside the art, but thereby becomes impertinent, or else it consents to remain within the practice of the art, but quickly exposes itself to recuperation....  The awkwardness of this alternative is the consequence of the fact that destruction of discourse is not a dialectic term *but a semantic term*: it docilely takes its place within the great semiological 'versus' myth (*white* versus *black*); whence the destruction of art is doomed to only *paradoxical* formulae (those which proceed literally against the *doxa*): both sides of the paradigm are glued together in an ultimately complicitous fashion: there is a structural agreement between the contesting and the contested forms" (Barthes 54-55)

"The text of pleasure is not necessarily the text that recounts pleasures; the text of bliss is never the text that recounts the kind of bliss afforded literally by an ejaculation" (Barthes 55)

"We must, moreover, distinguish between *figuration* and *representation*. 
"Figuration is the way in which the erotic body appears (to whatever degree and in whatever form that may be) in the profile of the text.... All these movements attest to a *figure* of the text, necessary to the bliss of reading.  Similarly, and even more than the text, the film will *always* be figurative (which is why films are still worth making) -- even if it represents nothing. 
"Representation, on the other hand, is *embarrassed* figuration, encumbered with other meanings than that of desire: a space of alibis (reality, morality, likelihood, readability, truth, etc.)" (Barthes 55-56)

"any semiotics that keeps desire within the configuration of those upon whom it acts, however new it may be, is a semiotics of representation.  That is what representation is:  when nothing emerges, when nothing leaps out of the frame: of the picture, the book, the screen" (Barthes 57)

"No sooner has a word been said, somewhere, about the pleasure of the text, than two policemen are ready to jump on you:  the political policeman and the psychoanalytical policeman:  futility and/or guilt, pleasure is either idle or vain, a class notion or an illusion" (Barthes 57)

"Pleasure is continually disappointed, reduced, deflated, in favor os strong, noble values:  Truth, Death, Progress, Struggle, Joy, etc.  Its victorious rival is Desire:  we are always being told about Desire, never about Pleasure; Desire has an epistemic dignity, Pleasure does not" (Barthes 57)

"So-called 'erotic' books (one must add: of recent vintage, in order to except Sade and a few others) *represent* not so much the erotic scene as the expectation of it, the preparation for it, its ascent; that is what makes them 'exciting'; and when the scene occurs, naturally there is disappointment, deflation.  In other words, these are books of Desire, not Pleasure.  Or, more mischievously, they represent Pleasure *as seen by psychoanalysis*.  A like meaning says, in both instances, that *the whole thing is very disappointing*" (Barthes 58)

"Imagine an aesthetic (if the word has not become too depreciated) based entirely (completely, radically, in every sense of the word) on the *pleasure of the consumer*, whoever he may be, to whatever class, whatever group he may belong, without respect to cultures or languages: the consequences would be huge, perhaps even harrowing" (Barthes 59)

"We are scientific because we lack subtlety" (Barthes 61)

"What we are seeking to establish in various ways is a theory of the materialist subject.  This undertaking can pass through three stages:  first, taking an old psychological path, it can relentlessly criticize the illusions the imaginary subject surrounds itself with (classical moralists have excelled in this sort of criticism); next -- or simultaneously -- it can go further, acknowledge the dizzying schism in the subject, described as a pure alternation, the alternation of zero and of its effacement (this concerns the text, since, though incapable of being *spoken* there, bliss nonetheless transmits the shudder of its annihilation); finally, it can generalize the subject ('multiple soul,' 'moral soul') -- which does not mean collectivize it; and here again, we come back to the text, pleasure, bliss" (Barthes 61-62)

"Then perhaps the subject returns, not as illusion, but as *fiction*.  A certain pleasure is derived from a way of imagining oneself as *individual*, of inventing a final, rarest fiction: the fictive identity.  This fiction is no longer the illusion of a unity; on the contrary, it is the theater of society in which we stage our plural: our pleasure is *individual* -- but not personal" (Barthes 62)

in encountering the individual, one encounters the "body of bliss":  "this body of bliss is also *my historical subject*; for it is at the conclusion of a very complex process of biographical, historical, sociological, neurotic elements (education, social class, childhood configuration, etc.) that I control the contradictory interplay of (cultural) pleasure and (non-cultural) bliss, and that I write myself as a subject at present out of place, arriving too soon or too late (this *too* designating neither regret, fault, nor bad luck, but merely calling for a *non-site*): anachronistic subject, adrift" (Barthes 62-63)

an imagined "typology of the pleasures of reading... could only be psychoanalytic, linking the reading neurosis to the hallucinated form of the text" (Barthes 63)

"we are now emphasizing, in the tissue, the generative idea that the text is made, is worked out in a perpetual interweaving; lost in this tissue -- this texture -- the subject unmakes himself, like a spider dissolving in the constructive secretions of its web" (Barthes 64)

"the position of pleasure in a theory of the text is not certain.  Simply, a day comes when we feel a certain need to *loosen* the theory a bit, to shift the discourse, the ideolect which repeats itself, becomes consistent, and to give it the shock of a question.  Pleasure is this question.  As a trivial, unworthy name... it can embarrass the text's return to morality, to truth, to the morality of truth: it is an oblique, a drag anchor, so to speak, without which the theory of the text would revert to a centered system, a philosophy of meaning" (Barthes 64-65)

"If it were possible to imagine an aesthetic of textual pleasure, it would have to include:  *writing aloud*" (Barthes 66)
