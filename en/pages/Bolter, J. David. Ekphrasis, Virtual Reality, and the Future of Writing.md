"For the skeptics, one danger in electronic writing is its apparent detachment from the material basis of all writing." (Bolter 253)

"Technological determinism is anathema to contemporary historiography and to postmodern theory in general.  Nearly all postmodern theorists agree that technologies are socially constructed.  For them, therefore, the computer as a writing technology must be defined by social and economic needs and preferences, not the other way around." (Bolter 254)

"One (rather obvious) reply is that the skeptics are setting up a false dichotomy.  Technological constraints and social construction always interact in such a way that it is impossible to separate the two." (Bolter 254)

"A technology can also render certain social constructions easier and therefore more popular.  Electronic writing systems do promote flexibility and changeability, rather than monumentality and permanence.  However, within these limitations and tendencies, there is a broad range of choices open to each culture or to each group." (Bolter 254)

"In the history of writing, some techniques and technologies have gone almost completely out of use.  The codex practically replaced the roll in late antiquity.  Parchment replaced papyrus in the European Middle Ages.  More often perhaps, a new technology takes over one function and leaves other functions to an existing technology.  Printing replaced handwriting for the distribution of most kinds of texts, but it did not make handwriting obsolete.  Electronic technology has already taken over some functions that belonged to print or to handwriting (business communication, accounting, record keeping, and so on), and it seems likely to appropriate others.  But we cannot predict whether there are certain functions that will indefinitely remain the province of the printed book." (Bolter 255)

"What matters is whether the printed book will survive as a cultural idea.  For most of us today, perhaps, the printed book is still the embodiment of text.  Both as authors and as readers, we still regard printed books and journals as the place to locate our most prestigious texts.  However, the printed book as an ideal is already under challenge from various electronic media." (Bolter 255)

"Printed books could remain abundant or even superabundant, as they are now, and still lose their status as a defining symbolic communication." (Bolter 256)

"if literature and humanistic scholarship are left in print, while scientific and technical communications move to electronic form, the result would only be the further marginalization of literature in our culture.  For in that case the scientific and literary communities would not share an ideal of publication or a forum for dialogue." (Bolter 256)

focus on graphics as the future of computer-based writing; relations between text and image, and development of multimodal genres

intermedia relations -- early expression of notion of remediation

"It is interesting to speculate how photography, film, television, and multimedia might have been developed and used, if Western culture could somehow have jumped over the technology of printing and gone directly from medieval iconography to chemical and electronic visual presentation.  What did happen is that these visual technologies had to define themselves in a culture of printed materials, and in particular in a literary culture dominated by the printed novel.  They had to assume the task of subverting the dominant model of prose, of breaking free of the constraints of verbal rhetoric." (Bolter 263)

"the effect of turning a newspaper into a multimedia screen can be seen as an inversion of the classical device of the *ekphrasis*.  *Ekphrasis* is the description in prose or poetry of an artistic object or striking visual scene; it is the attempt to capture the visual in words.  Today, as the visual and the sensual are emerging out of verbal communications, images are given the task (as in the *Ulysses* program) of explaining words, rather than the reverse." (Bolter 264)

"It is possible that writing will be identified more and more as an 'elite' activity, while the more popular modes of communication will be ones that strive to restrict or eliminate the arbitrary sign." (Bolter 270)

"The new media also threaten to drain contemporary prose of its rhetorical possibilities.  Popular prose responds with a desire to emulate computer graphics.  Academic and other specialized forms respond by a retreat into jargon or into willful anachronisms." (Bolter 270)

"The verbal text must now struggle to assert its legitimacy in a space increasingly dominated by visual modes of representation." (Bolter 271)
