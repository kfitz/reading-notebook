McLuhan, Marshall. The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1962.


"We are as far into the electric age as the Elizabethans had advanced into the typographical and mechanical age.  And we are experiencing the same confusions and indecisions which they had felt when living simultaneously in two contrasted forms of society and experience." (McLuhan 1)

"That outering or uttering of sense which is language and speech..." (McLuhan 5)

"Now, in the electric age, the very instantaneous nature of co-existence among our technological instruments has created a crisis quite new in human history.  Our extended facilities and sense now constitute a single field of experience which demands that they become collectively conscious.  Our technologies, like our private senses, now demand an interplay and ratio that makes *rational* co-existence possible." (McLuhan 5)

"The role played by print in instituting new patterns of culture is not unfamiliar.  But one natural consequence of the specializing action of the new forms of knowledge was that all kinds of power took on a strongly centralist character." (McLuhan 12)

"Schizophrenia may be a necessary consequence of literacy" (McLuhan 22)

"No other kind of writing save the phonetic has ever translated man out of the possessive world of total interdependence and interrelation that is the auditory network" (McLuhan 22)

"Those who experience the first onset of a new technology, whether it be alphabet or radio, respond most emphatically because the new sense ratios set up at once by the technological dilation or eye or ear, present man with a surprising new world, which evokes a new 'closure,' or novel pattern of interplay, among all of the senses together.  But the initial shock gradually dissipates as the entire community absorbs the new habit of perception into all of its areas of work and association.  But the real revolution is in this later and prolonged phase of 'adjustment' of all personal and social life to the new model of perception set up by the new technology." (McLuhan 22-23)

"Civilization gives the barbarian or tribal man an eye for an ear and is now at odds with the electronic world." (McLuhan 26)

"This book will try to explain why print culture confers on man a language of thought which leaves him quite unready to face the language of his own electro-magnetic technology." (McLuhan 30)

"all reading in the ancient and medieval worlds was reading aloud.  With print the eye speeded up and the voice quieted down." (McLuhan 43)

"Printing was the first mechanization of an ancient handicraft and led easily to the further mechanization of all handicrafts." (McLuhan 44)

"Only one third of the history of the book in the Western world has been typographic." (McLuhan 74)

"we have tended to associate lip movements and mutterings from a reader with semi-literacy" (McLuhan 83)

"But if reading aloud favours synesthesia and tactility, so did the ancient and medieval manuscript." (McLuhan 83)

"Manuscript culture is conversational if only because the writer and his audience are physically related by the form of *publication as performance*." (McLuhan 84)

"The invention of typography confirmed and extended the new visual stress of applied knowledge, providing the first uniformly repeatable *commodity*, the first assembly-line, and the first mass-production." (McLuhan 124)

"The reader of print... stands in an utterly different relation to the writer from the reader of manuscript.  Print gradually made reading aloud pointless, and accelerated the act of reading till the reader could feel 'in the hands of' his author." (McLuhan 125)

"As might be expected, the printed book was a long time in being recognized as anything but a typescript, a more accessible and portable kind of manuscript.  It is this kind of transitional awareness that in our own century is recorded in words and phrases such as 'horseless carriage,' 'wireless,' or 'moving-pictures.'  'Telegraph' and 'television' seem to have registered a more direct impact than mechanical forms such as typography and movies.  Yet it would have been just as difficult to explain the Gutenberg innovation to a man in the sixteenth century as it is now to explain the utter diversity of TV and film images." (McLuhan 130)

E. P. Goldschmidt, in /Medieval Texts and Their First Appearance in Print/:  "the Middle Ages for various reasons and from various causes did not possess the concept of 'authorship' in exactly the same significance as we have it now." (qtd in McLuhan 131)

"Authorship before print was in large degree the building of a mosaic" (McLuhan 132)

"the hot medium of print enabled men to *see* their vernaculars for the first time, and to visualize national unity and power in terms of the vernacular bounds" (McLuhan 138)

"The sixteenth century Renaissance was an age on the frontier between two thousand years of alphabetic and manuscript culture, on the one hand, and the new mechanism of repeatability and quantification, on the other.  It would have been strange, indeed, if the age had not approached the new in terms of what it had learned from the old." (McLuhan 141)

"during the first two centuries of print, until the end of the seventeenth century, the great body of printed matter was of medieval origin.... As today, the insatiable needs of TV have brought down upon us the backlog of the old movies, so the needs of the new presses could only be met by the old manuscripts." (McLuhan 142) -- so should we be focusing on republishing print texts online?  or has project gutenberg already managed that?  was part of the issue that no one yet knew how to write for print?

"The new homogeneity of the printed page seemed to inspire a subliminal faith in the validity of the printed Bible as bypassing the traditional oral authority of the Church, on the one hand, and the need for rational critical scholarship on the other.  It was as if print, uniform and repeatable commodity that it was, had the power of creating a new hypnotic superstition of the book as independent of and uncontaminated by human agency." (McLuhan 144) -- but it also created authorship?

"today, the conflict goes the other way.  The highly literate and individualist liberal mind is tormented by the pressure to become collectively oriented.  The literate liberal is convinced that all real values are private, personal, individual.  Such is the message of mere literacy.  Yet the new electric technology pressures him towards the need for total human interdependence." (McLuhan 157)

"Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance.  Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition.  Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than manuscript culture could ever do.  Print is the technology of individualism." (McLuhan 158)

"The medieval Book of Nature was for *contemplatio* like the Bible.  THe Renaissance Book of Nature was for *applicatio* and use like movable types." (McLuhan 185)

"Henceforth, literature will be at war with itself and with the social mechanics of conscious goals and motivations.  For the matter of literary vision will be collective and mythic, while the forms of literary expression and communication will be individualist, segmental, and mechanical.  The vision will be tribal and collective, the expression private and marketable.  This dilemma continues to the present to rend the individual Western consciousness." (McLuhan 269)

"As the market society defined itself, literature moved into the role of consumer commodity.  The public became patron.  Art reversed its role from guide for perception into convenient amenity or package.  But the producer or artist was compelled, as never before, to study the effect of his art." (McLuhan 275)
