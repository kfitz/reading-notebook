McLuhan, Marshall.  Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. 1964. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1994.


INTRODUCTION TO THE MIT PRESS EDITION (Lewis Lapham)

book introduced contemporary usage of “media,” as well as “global village” and “Age of Information”

hot (print) v. cool (tv) media

“McLuhan’s thought meets the specifications of the epistemology that he ascribes to the electronic media — nonlineal, repetitive, discontinuous, intuitive, proceeding by analogy instead of by sequential argument” (Lapham xi)

two revolutions: movable type, electricity

print: visual, mechanical, sequence, composition, eye, active, expansion, complete, soliloquy, classification, center, continuous, syntax, self-expression, Typographic man
electronic: tactile, organic, simultaneity, improvisation, ear, reactive, contraction, incomplete, chorus, pattern recognition, margin, discontinuous, mosaic, group therapy, Graphic man

“television is not narrative . . . it bears more of a resemblance to symbolist poetry or the pointillist painting of Georges Seurat than it does to anything conceived by a novelist, a historican, an essayist, or even a writer of newspaper editorials.” (Lapham xiv-xv)

“The individual voice and singular point of view disappears into the chorus of a corporate and collective consciousness, which, in McLuhan’s phrase, doesn’t ‘postulate consciousness of anything in particular.’” (Lapham xxi)


PART I

INTRODUCTION

“After three thousand years of explosion, by means of fragmentary and mechanical technologies, the western world is imploding.” (McLuhan 3)

“Rapidly, we approach the final phase of the extensions of man — the technological simulation of consciousness, when the creative process of knowing will be collectively and corporately extended to the whole of human society” (McLuhan 3-4)

“If the nineteenth century was the age of the editorial chair, ours is the century of the psychiatrist’s couch.” (McLuhan 5)

"Every culture and every age has its favorite model of perception and knowledge that it is inclined to prescribe for everybody and everything.  The mark of our time is its revulsion against imposed patterns" (McLuhan 5)


1. THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE

“the medium is the message.  This is to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium — that is, of any extension of ourselves — result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology.” (McLuhan 7)

"Many people would be disposed to say that it was not the machine, but what one did with the machine, that was its meaning or message" (McLuhan 7)

“The electric light is pure information.  It is a medium without a message, as it were, unless it is used to spell out some verbal ad or name.  This fact, characteristic of all media, means that the ‘content’ or any medium is always another medium.” (McLuhan 8)

"the 'message' of any medium or technology is the change of scale or pace or pattern that it introduces into human affairs" (McLuhan 8)

“The electric light escapes attention as a communication medium just because it has no ‘content.’  And this makes it an invaluable instance of how people fail to study media at all. . . . The message of the electric light is like the message of electric power in industry, totally radical, pervasive, and decentralized.” (McLuhan 9)

"In accepting an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame a few years ago, General David Sarnoff made this statement: 'We are too prine to make technological instruments the scapegoats for the sins of those who wield them.  The products of modern science are not in themselves good or bad; it is the way they are used that determines their value.'  That is the voice of the current somnambulism.  Suppose we were to say, 'Apple pie is in itself neither good nor bad; it is the way it is used that determines its value.'  Or, 'The smallpox virus is in itself neither good nor bad; it is the way it is used that determines its value.' Again, 'Firearms are in themselves neither good nor bad; it is the way they are used that determines their value.'  That is, if the slugs reach the right people firearms are good.  If the TV tube fires the right ammunition at the right people it is good.  I am not being perverse.  There is simply nothing in the Sarnoff statement that will bear scrutiny, for it ignores the nature of the medium, of any and all media, in the true Narcissus style of one hypnotized by the amputation and extension of his own being in a new technical form" (McLuhan 11)

“Mechanization was never so vividly fragmented or sequential as in the birth of the movies, the moment that translated us beyond mechanism into the world of growth and organic interrelation.  The movie, by sheer speeding up of the mechanical, carried us from the world of sequence and connections into the world of creative configuration and structure.  The message of the movie medium is that of transition from lineal connections to configurations.” (McLuhan 12)

“with electric media Western man himself experiences exactly the same inundation as the remote native.” (McLuhan 16)

“Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot.  For the ‘content’ of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind.  The effect of the medium is made strong and intense just because it is given another medium as ‘content.’  The content of a movie is a novel or a play or an opera.  The effect of the movie form is not related to its program content.” (McLuhan 18)

"This is like the voice of the literate man, floundering in a milieu of ads, who boasts, 'Personally, I pay no attention to ads.'...  The effects of technology do not occur at the level of opinions or concepts, but alter sense ratios or patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance" (McLuhan 18)


2. MEDIA HOT AND COLD

“A hot medium is one that extends one single sense in ‘high definition.’  High definition is the state of being well filled with data.” (McLuhan 22)

“hot media do not leave so much to be finned in or completed by the audience.  Hot media are, therefore, low in participation, and cool media are high in participation or completion by the audience.” (McLuhan 23)

"The hotting-up of the medium of writing to repeatable print intensity led to nationalism and the religious wars of the sixteenth century" (McLuhan 23)

"Specialist technologies detribalize.  The nonspecialist electronic technology retribalizes" (McLuhan 24)

"myth *is* the instant vision of a complex process that ordinarilty extends over a long period.  Myth is contraction or implosion of any process, and the instant speed of electricity confers the mything dimension on ordinary industrial and social action today.  We *live* mythically but continue to think fragmentarily and on single planes" (McLuhan 25)

"In terms of the theme of media hot and cold, backward countries are cool, and we are hot.  The 'city slicker' is hot, and the rustic is cool.  But in terms of the reversal of procedures and values in the electric age, the past mechanical time was hot, and we of the TV age are cool.... The jazz of the period of the hot new media of movie and radio was hot jazz.... Cool jazz came in quite naturally after the first impact of radio and movie had been absorbed" (McLuhan 27)

"Whole cultures could now be programmed to keep their emotional climate stable in the same way that we have begun to know something about maintaining equilibrium in the commercial economies of the world" (McLuhan 28)

"to the literary person who is quite unaware of the intensely abstract nature of the typographic medium, it is the grosser and participant forms of art that seem 'hot,' and the abstract and intensely literary form that seems 'cool'" (McLuhan 32)


3. REVERSAL OF THE OVERHEATED MEDIUM

“during the stages of their development all things appear under forms opposite to those that they finally present” (McLuhan 34)

"The stepping-up of speed from the mechanical to the instant electric form reverses explosion into implosion.  In our present electric age the imploding or contracting energies of our world now clash with the old expansionist and traditional patterns of organization" (McLuhan 35)

"it is not the increase of numbers in the world that creates our concern with population.  Rather, it is the fact that everybody in the world has to live in the utmost proximity created by our electric involvement in one another's lives" (McLuhan 35)

“Electricity does not centralize, but decentralizes.” (McLuhan 36)

"This reverse pattern appeared quite early in electrical 'labor-saving' devices, whther a toaster or washing machine or vacuum cleaner.  Instead of saving work, these devices permit everybody to do his own work" (McLuhan 36)

“In the new electric Age of Information and programmed production, commodities themselves assume more and more the character of information” (McLuhan 36)

"As electric information levels rise, almost any kind of material will serve any kind of need or function, forcing the intellectual more and more into the role of social command and into the service of production" (McLuhan 36)

“One of the most common causes of breaks in any system is the cross-fertilization with another system, such as happened to print with the steam press, or with radio and movies (that yielded the talkies).” (McLuhan 39)


4. THE GADGET LOVER: NARCISSUS AS NARCOSIS

“men at once become fascinated by any extension of themselves in any material other than themselves.” (McLuhan 41)

“The principle of self-amputation as an immediate relief of strain on the central nervous system applies very readily to the origin of the media of communication from speech to computer.” (McLuhan 43)
 
"With the arrival of electric technology, man extended, or set outside himself, a live model of the central nervous system itself.  To the degree that this is so, it is a development that suggests a desperate and suicidal autoamputation, as if the central nervous system could no longer depend on the physical organs to be protective barriers against the slings and arrows of outrageous mechanism" (McLuhan 43)
 
"Any invention or technology is an extension or self-amputation of our physical bodies, and such extension also demands new ratios or new equilibriums among the other organs and extensions of the body.... But the effect of the entry of the TV image will vary from culture to culture in accourdance with the existing sense ratios in each culture.... In America, the intensely visual culture, TV has opened the doors of audile-tactile perception to the non-visual world of spoken languages and food and the plastic arts" (McLuhan 45)

“the *beholding* of idols, or the use of technology” (McLuhan 45)

"To behold, use or perceive any extension of ourselves in technological form is necessarily to embrace it.... It is this continuous embrace of our own technology in daily use that puts us in the Narcissus role of subliminal awareness and numbness in relation to these images of ourselves" (McLuhan 46)

“Man becomes, as it were, the sex organs of the machine world” (McLuhan 46)

“the age of anxiety and of electric media is also the age of the unconscious and of apathy.  But it is strikingly the age of consciousness of the unconscious, in addition.” (McLuhan 47)

“In the electric age we wear all mankind as our skin.” (McLuhan 47)

5. HYBRID ENERGY: LES LIAISON DANGEREUSES

"the interplay among media is only another name for this 'civil war' that rages in our society and our psyches alike" (McLuhan 48)

“The sudden crossings or hybridizations of the media release great new force and energy as by fission or fusion.” (McLuhan 48)

"media, or the extensions of man, are 'make happen' agents, but not 'make aware' agents" (McLuhan 48)

“this is especially true of our media.  They are put out long before they are thought out.” (McLuhan 49)

“nothing could be more subversive of the Marxian dialectic than the idea that linguistic media shape social development, as much as do the means of production.” (McLuhan 49)

"Not only does the visual, specialist, and fragmented Westerner have now to live in closest daily association with all the ancient oral cultures of the earth, but his own electric technology now begins to translate the visual or eye man back into the tribal and oral pattern with its seamless web of kinship and interdependence" (McLuhan 50)

"The immediate prospect for literate, fragmented Western man encountering the electric implosion within his own culture is his steady and rapid transformation into a complex and depth-structured person emotionally aware of his total interdependence with the rest of human society" (McLuhan 50-51)

"What I am saying is that media as extensions of our senses institute new ratios, not only among our private senses, but among themselves, when they interact among themselves" (McLuhan 53)

“from the point of view of the owners of the film and related media, the best seller is a form of insurance that some massive new gestalt or pattern has been isolated in the public psyche” (McLuhan 54)

"The hybrid or the meeting of two media is a moment of truth and revelation from which new form is born.  For the parallel between two media holds us on the frontiers between forms that snap us out of the Narcissus-narcosis" (McLuhan 55)


6. MEDIA AS TRANSLATORS

“technologies are ways of translating one kind of knowledge into another mode” (McLuhan 56)

“All media are active metaphors in their power to translate experience into new forms.” (McLuhan 57)

“In this electric age we see ourselves being translated more and more into the form of information, moving toward the technological extension of consciousness.” (McLuhan 57)

“all forms of wealth result from the movement of information.” (McLuhan 58)


7. CHALLENGE AND COLLAPSE: THE NEMESIS OF CREATIVITY

“Those who are concerned with the program ‘content’ of media and not with the medium proper, appear to be in the position of physicians who ignore the ‘syndrome of being just sick.’” (McLuhan 64)

“Perhaps the most obvious ‘closure’ or psychic consequence of any new technology is just the demand for it.  Nobody wants a motorcar till there are motorcars, and nobody is interested in TV until there are TV programs.  This power of technology to create its own world of demand is not independent of technology being first an extension of our own bodies and senses.” (McLuhan 67-68)

“Electric technology is directly related to our central nervous systems, so it is ridiculous to talk of ‘what the public wants’ played over its own nerves.’” (McLuhan 68)

"Once we have surrendered our senses and nervous systems to the private manipulation of those who would try to benefit from taking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves, we don't really have any rights left" (McLuhan 68)

"When the technology of a time is powerfully thrusting in one direction, wisdom may well call for a countervailing thrust.  The implosion of electric energy in our century cannot be met by explosion or expansion, but it can be met by decentralism and the flexibility of multiple small centers" (McLuhan 71)

“It was Macaulay who remarked that it was not pleasant to live in times about which it was exciting to read.” (McLuhan 72)


PART II

8. THE SPOKEN WORD: FLOWER OF EVIL?

“The written word spells out in sequence what is quick and implicit in the spoken word.” (McLuhan 79)

“Language extends and amplifies man but it also divides his faculties.” (McLuhan 79) — death of collective unconscious attributable to language?

9. THE WRITTEN WORD: AN EYE FOR AN EAR

“electric technology seems to favor the inclusive and participational spoken word over the specialist written word.  Our Western values, built on the written word, have already been considerably affected by the electronic media of telephone, radio, and TV.” (McLuhan 82)

“The easier alphabet and the light, cheap, transportable papyrun together effected the transfer of power from the priestly to the military class.” (McLuhan 83)

“the hidden cause of out Western bias toward sequence as ‘logic’ [is] is the all-pervasive technology of the alphabet.” (McLuhan 85)

“As we move out of the Gutenberg era of our own culture, we can more readily discern its primary features of honogeneity, uniformity, and continuity.” (McLuhan 87)

10. ROADS AND PAPER ROUTES

“The tern ‘communication’ has had an extensive use in connection with roads and bridges, sea routes, rivers, and canals, even before it became transformed into ‘information movement’ in the electric age.” (McLuhan 89)

“Speed-up creates what some economists refer to as a center-margin structure. . . . Electric speeds create centers everywhere.  Margins cease to exist on this planet.” (McLuhan 91)

“Is there an instance of any culture that understood the technology that sustained its structure and was prepared to keep it that way?” (McLuhan 93)

structural changes in organization of space resulting from wheel, road and papyrus:  village to city-state to empire

“The post roads of England were, for the most part, paid for by the newspapers.” (McLuhan 101)

electric extensions (railroad, car, plane; telephone, radio, television) bypass space and time

11. NUMBER: PROFILE OF THE CROWD

“Just as writing is an extension and separation of our most neutral and objective sense, the sense of sight, number is an extension and separation of our most intimate and interrelating activity, our sense of touch.” (McLuhan 107)

“the nonliterate digital computer substitutes ‘yes’ and ‘no’ for numbers.  The computer is strong on contours, weak on digits.” (McLuhan 110)

“the link between the medieval positional zero and the Renaissance vanishing point” (McLuhan 115)

“Print gave to men the concept of indefinite repetition so necessary to the mathematical concept of infinity.” (McLuhan 116)

12. CLOTHING: OUR EXTENDED SKIN

“Clothing, as an extension of the skin, can be seen as both a heat-control mechanism and as a means of defining the self socially.” (McLuhan 119)

13. HOUSING: NEW LOOK AND NEW OUTLOOK

“If clothing is an extension of our private skins to store and channel our own heat and energy, housing is a collective means of achieving the same end for the family or the group.” (McLuhan 123)

“Men live in round houses until they become sedentary and specialized in their work organization.” (McLuhan 125)

“If color photography has created ‘museums without walls,’ how much more has electric lighting created space without walls, and day without night.” (McLuhan 128)

14. MONEY: THE POOR MAN’S CREDIT CARD

“Money began in nonliterate cultures as a commodity. . . . In literate cultures, circumstances may reintroduce commodity money. . . . Money always retains something of its commodity and community character.” (McLuhan 131-32)

“Money, as a social means of extending and amplifying work and skill in an easily accessible and portable form, lost much of its magical power with the coming of representative money, or paper money.” (McLuhan 134)

“Automation, which is electronic, does not represent physical work so much as programmed knowledge.  As work is replaced by the sheer movement of information, money as a store of work merges with the informational formas of credit and credit card.” (McLuhan 137)

15. CLOCKS: THE SCENT OF TIME

“great cultural changes occurred in the West when it was found possible to fix time as something that happens between two points. . . . From our division of time into uniform, visualizable units comes our sense of duration and our impatience when we cannot endure the delay between events.” (McLuhan 145)

“The mechanical clock, in short, helps to create the image of a numerically quantified and mechanically powered universe.” (McLuhan 146)

“In the space-time world of electric technology, the older mechanical time begins to feel unacceptable, if only because it is uniform.” (McLuhan 147)

“Clocks are mechanical media that transform tasks and create new work and wealth by accelerating the pace of human association.  By coordinating and accelerating human meetings and goings-on, clocks increase the sheer quantity of human exchange.” (McLuhan 155)

16. THE PRINT: HOW TO DIG IT

“Repeatability is the core of the mechanical principle that has dominated our world, especially since the Gutenberg technology.  The message of the print and of typography is primarily that of repeatability.” (McLuhan 160)

“It may contradict popular ideas to say that typography as a hot medium involves the reader much less than did manuscript, or to point out that the comic book and TV as cool media involve the user, as maker and participant, a great deal.” (McLuhan 161)

“The increasing precision and quantity of visual information transformed the print into a three-dimensional world of perspective and fixed point of view.” (McLuhan 162)

17. COMICS: MAD VESTIBULE TO TV

“From three million dots per second on TV, the viewer is able to accept, in an iconic grasp, only a few dozen, seventy or so, from which to shape an image.  The image thus made is as crude as that of the comics. . . . The print is the clue to the comic cartoon, just as the cartoon is clue to understanding the TV image.” (McLuhan 164-65)

“Today our ten-year-olds, in voting for MAD, are telling us in their own way that the TV image has ended the consumer phase of American culture. . . . The pictorial consumer age is dead.  The iconic age is upon us.” (McLuhan 167)

18. THE PRINTED WORD: ARCHITECT OF NATIONALISM

“if seen merely as a store of information, or as a new means of speedy retrieval of knowledge, typography ended parochialism and tribalism, psychically and socially, both in space and in time.” (McLuhan 170)

“Electric means of moving of imformation are altering our typographic culture as sharply as print modified medieval manuscript and scholastic culture.” (McLuhan 171)

“The linearity precision and uniformisty of the arrangement of moveable types are inseparable from these great cultural forms and innovations of Renaissance experience.” (McLuhan 172)

“Perhaps the most significant of the gifts of typography to man is that of detachment and noninvolvement — the power to act without reacting.” (McLuhan 173)

“The uniformity and repeatability of print permeated the Renaissance with the idea of time and space as continuous measurable quantities.  The immediate effect of this idea was to desacralize the world of nature and the world of power alike.” (McLuhan 176)

19. WHEEL, BICYCLE, AND AIRPLANE

“One of the most advanced and complicated uses of the wheel occurs in the movie camera and in the movie projector.” (McLuhan 181)

“That the movie re-creates organic process and movement by pushing the mechanical principle to the point of reversal is a pattern that appears in all human extensions, whatever, as they reach a peak of performance.” (McLuhan 182)

“Humpty-Dumpty is the familiar example of the clown unsuccessfully imitating the acrobat.  Just because all the King’s horses and all the King’s men couldn’t put Humpty-Dumpty together again, it doesn’t follow that electromagnetic automation couldn’t have put Humpty-Dumpty back together.  The integral and unified egg had no business sitting on a wall, anyway.  Walls are made of uniformly fragmented bricks that arise with specialisms and bureaucracies.  They are the deadly enemies of integral beings like eggs.  Humpty-Dumpty met the challenge of the wall with a spectacular collapse.” (McLuhan 183)

“The wheel is an ablative absolute of feet, as chair is the ablative absolute of backside.” (McLuhan 184)

20. THE PHOTOGRAPH: THE BROTHEL-WITHOUT-WALLS

“It is one of the peculiar characteristics of the photo that it isolates single moments in time.  The TV camera does not.  The continuous scanning action of the TV camera provides, not the isolated moment or aspect, but the contour, the iconic profile and the transparency.” (McLuhan 188)

“the photograph extends and multiplies the human image to the proportions of mass-produced merchandise.” (McLuhan 189)

“The step from the age of Typographic Man to the age of Graphic Man was taken with the invention of photography.” (McLuhan 190)

“the logic of the photograph is neither verbal nor syntactical, a condition which renders literary culture quite helpless to cope with the photograph.” (McLuhan 197)

21. PRESS: GOVERNMENT BY NEWS LEAK

newspaper as mosaic

“It is for this reason that the press seems to be performing its function most when revealing the seamy side.  Real news is bad news — bad news about somebody or bad news for somebody.” (McLuhan 205)

 “The ads are by far the best part of any magazine or newspaper.  More pains and thought, more wit and art go into the making of an ad than into any prose feature of press or magazine.  Ads are news. What is wrong with them is that they are always good news.  In order to balance off the effect and to sell good news, it is necessary to have a lot of bad news.” (McLuhan 210)

22. MOTORCAR: THE MECHANICAL BRIDE

“as funny as the Viennese analysts have been able to get about the car as sex object, they have at last, in so doing, drawn attention to the fact that, like the bees in the plant world, men have always been the sex organs of the technological world.” (McLuhan 220)

23. ADS: KEEPING UPSET WITH THE JONESES

“The trend in ads, then, is away from the consumer picture of product to the producer image of process. The corporate image of process includes the consumer in the producer role as well.” (McLuhan 226-27)

“Any ad put into a new setting is funny.  This is a way of saying that any ad consciously attended to is comical.  Ads are not meant for conscious consumption.  They are intended as subliminal pills for the subconscious” (McLuhan 228)

“When the movies came, the entire pattern of American life went on the screen as a nonstop ad. . . . The result was that all ads in magazines and the press had to look like scenes from a movie.” (McLuhan 231)

24. GAMES: THE EXTENSIONS OF MAN

“Games are popular art, collective, social reactions to the main drive or action of any culture.” (McLuhan 235)

“Perhaps there is, just for this reason, a desperate need for games in a highly specialized industrial culture, since they are the only form of art accessible to many minds. . . . Men without art, and men without the popular arts of games, tend toward automatism.” (McLuhan 241)

25. TELEGRAPH: THE SOCIAL HORMONE

“Whereas all previous technology (save speech, itself) had, in effect, extended some part of our bodies, electricity may be said to have outered the central nervous system itself, including the brain.” (McLuhan 247)

“Electricity is only incidentally visual and auditory; it is primarily tactile.” (McLuhan 249)

“In big industry new ideas are invited to rear their heads so that they can be clobbered at once.  The idea department of a big firm is a sort of lab for isolating dangerous viruses.  When one is found, it is assigned to a group for neutralizing and immunizing treatment . . . no new idea ever starts from within a big operation.  It must assail the organization from outside” (McLuhan 251)

“Electric media, however, abolish the spatial dimension, rather than enlarge it.” (McLuhan 255)

26. THE TYPEWRITER: INTO THE AGE OF THE IRON WHIM

“the typewriter now fuses the functions of the pen and sword” (McLuhan 259)

“The typewriter fuses composition and publication, causing an entirely new attitude to the written and printed word.” (McLuhan 260)

27. THE TELEPHONE: SOUNDING BRASS OR TINKLING SYMBOL?

“With the telephone, there occurs the extension of ear and voice that is a kind of extra sensory perception.” (McLuhan 265)

telephone as cool medium; requires much participation

28. THE PHONOGRAPH: THE TOY THAT SHRANK THE NATIONAL CHEST

phonograph as extension of voice; hot medium

29. MOVIES: THE REEL WORLD

“Typographic man took readily to film just because, like books, it offers an inward world of fantasy and dreams.  The film viewer sits in psychological solitude like the silent book reader.  This was not the case with the manuscript reader, nor is it true of the watcher of television.” (McLuhan 292)

“the film medium as a monster ad for consumer goods” (McLuhan 294)

30. RADIO: THE TRIBAL DRUM

radio as hot medium: “The famous Orson Welles broadcast about the invasion from Mars was a simple demonstration of the all-inclusive, completely involving scope of the auditory image of radio.  It was Hitler who gave radio the Orson Welles treatment for real.” (McLuhan 299-300)

31. TELEVISION: THE TIMID GIANT

“As a cool medium TV has, some feel, introduced a kind of rigor mortis into the body politic.  It is the extraordinary degree of audience participation in the TV medium that explains its failure to tackle hot issues.” (McLuhan 309)

“Seen outside the United States, any American movie looks like subtle political propaganda.  Acceptable entertainment has to flatter and exploit the cultural and political assumptions of the land of its origin.” (McLuhan 310-11)

“Print is a hot medium.  It projects the author at the public as the movie did.  The manuscript is a cool medium that does not project the author, so much as involve the reader.  So with TV.  The viewer is involved and participant.  The role of the TV star, in this way, seems more fascinating than his private life.” (McLuhan 318)

“the mosaic is not uniform, continuous, or repetitive.  It is discontinuous, skew, and nonlineal, like the tactual TV image.” (McLuhan 334)

32. WEAPONS: WAR OF THE ICONS

“That is why the transition from mechanical to electric technology is so very traumatic and severe for us all.  The mechanical techniques, with their limited powers, we have long used as weapons.  The electric techniques cannot be used aggressively except to end all life at once, like the turning off of a light.” (McLuhan 342)

33. AUTOMATION: LEARNING A LIVING

“Whereas in the mechanical age of fragmentation leisure had been the absence of work, or mere idleness, the reverse is true in the electric age.  As the age of information demands the simultaneous use of all our faculties, we discover that we are most at leisure when we are most intensely involved.” (McLuhan 347)

“Automation is not an extension of the mechanical principles of fragmentation and separation of operations.  It is rather then invasion of the mechanical world by the instantaneous character of electricity.” (McLuhan 349)

“Automation brings in real ‘mass production,’ not in terms of size, but of an instant inclusive embrace.  Such is also the character of ‘mass media.’  They are an indication, not of the size of their audiences, but of the fact that everybody becomes involved in them at the same time.” (McLuhan 349)
