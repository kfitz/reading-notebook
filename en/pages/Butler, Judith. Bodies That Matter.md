Preface

return to the ground of Gender Trouble, this time taking into consideration the materiality of bodies

"Not only did bodies tend to indicate a world beyond themselves, but this movement beyond their own boundaries, a movement of boundary itself, appeared to be quite central to what bodies 'are'." (ix)

constructedness of bodies and performativity of gender appear to defy the materiality of bodies

"if I were to argue that genders are performative, that could mean that I thought that one woke in the morning, perused the closet or some more open space for the gender of choice, donned that gender for the day, and then restored the garment to its place at night.  Such a willful and instrumental subject, one who decides on its gender, is clearly not its gender from the start and fails to realize that its existence is already decided by gender.  Certainly, such a theory would restore a figure of a choosing subject -- humanist -- at the center of a project whose emphasis on construction seems to be quite opposed to such a notion. 
"But if there is no subject who decides on its gender, and if, on the contrary, gender is part of what decides the subject, how might one formulate a project that preserves gender practices as sites of critical agency?... If gender is not an artifice to be taken on or taken off at will and, hence, not an effect of choice, how are we to understand the constitutive and compelling status of gender norms without falling into the trap of cultural determinism?  How precisely are we to understand the ritualized repetition by which such norms produce and stabilize not only the effects of gender but the materiality of sex?" (x)

"why is what is constructed understood as an artificial and dispensable character?  What are we to make of constructions without which we would not be able to think, to live, to make sense at all, those which have acquired for us a kind of necessity?...  Thinking the body as constructed demands a rethinking of the meaning of construction itself." (xi)

Introduction

"Is there a way to link the question of the materiality of the body to the performativity of gender?  And how does the category of 'sex' figure within such a relationship?" (1)

"sex" as normative, regulatory, an ideal construct with which bodies never fully comply

"performativity must be understood not as a singular or deliberate 'act,' but, rather, as the reiterative and citational practice by which discourse produces the effects that it names." (2)

"once 'sex' itself is understood in its normativity, the materiality of the body will not be thinkable apart from the materialization of that regulatory norm.  'Sex' is, thus, not simply what one has, or a static description of what one is:  it will be one of the norms by which the 'one' becomes viable at all, that which qualifies a body for life within the domain of cultural intelligibility." (2)

exclusionary production of subjects via "sex" requires production of domain of abjection outside of subjectivity

"the mobilization of the categories of sex within political discourse will be haunted in some ways by the very instabilities that the categories effectively produce and foreclose." (4)
From Construction to Materialization

does rhetoric of construction that sets up a culture/nature, gender/sex binary relation suggest that sex=passive=feminine and gender=active=masculine?

"nature" has a history, first of all; relationship of "sex" to "nature" is troubled

problems of "construction":  what of materiality?  who is doing the constructing? -- both questions that misconstrue theoretical problems of constructivism

questions of agency as "the seductions of grammar" (6):  "I would suggest that it takes a certain suspicion toward grammar to reconceive the matter in a different light.  For if gender is constructed, it is not necessarily constructed by an 'I' or a 'we' who stands before that construction in any spatial or temporal sense of 'before.'  Indeed, it is unclear that there can be an 'I' or a 'we' who has not been submitted, subjected to gender, where gendering is, among other things, the differentiating relations by which speaking subjects come into being." (7)

but human subjects are not merely constructed; such construction is also an exclusion, a creation of the inhuman

also, construction often either claims structures (like Culture, Discourse, or Power) that achieve the lost agency of the human, or claims to be a singular deterministic act

"What I would propose in place of these conceptions of construction is a return to the notion of matter, not as site or surface, but as a process of materialization that stabilizes over time to produce the effect of boundary, fixity, and surface we call matter." (9)

construction as temporal, reiterative process; sex both produced and destabilized through reiteration -- a sedimented effect
Performativity as Citationality

"Performativity is thus not a singular 'act,' for it is always a reiteration of a norm or set of norms, and to the extent that it acquires an act-like status in the present, it conceals or dissimulates the conventions of which it is a repetition.  Moreover, this act is not primarily theatrical; indeed, its apparent theatricality is produced to the extent that its historicity remains dissimulated (and, conversely, its theatricality gains a certain inevitability given the impossibility of a full disclosure of its historicity)." (12-13)

"According to the biblical [read Austinian?] rendition of the performative, i.e., 'Let there be light!,' it appears that it is by virtue of the power of a subject or its will that a phenomenon is named into being.  In a critical reformulation of the performative, Derrida makes clear that this power is not the function of an originating will, but is always derivative" (13)

citational nature of the performative:  "could it be that the production of the subject as originator of his/her effects is precisely a consequence of this dissimulated citationality?" (13)

links psychoanalysis to discursive theory; Lacan's "assumption" of symbolic law as a kind of citation of the law; materialization of sex linked to performativity as citationality -- the law is not fixed, but rather created by its citations

constitutive constraints on subjectivity in construction relocate "agency as a reiterative or rearticulatory practice, immanent to power, and not a relation of external opposition to power." (15)

"How, then, can one think through the matter of bodies as a kind of materialization governed by regulatory norms in order to ascertain the workings of heterosexual hegemony in the formation of what qualifies as a viable body?  How does that materialization of the norm in bodily formation produce a domain of abjected bodies, a field of deformation, which, in failing to qualify as the fully human, fortifies those regulatory norms?  What challenge does that excluded and abjected realm produce to a symbolic hegemony that might force a radical rearticulation of what qualifies as bodies that matter, ways of living that count as 'life,' lives worth protecting, lives worth saving, lives worth grieving?" (16)
Trajectory of the Text

"It seems crucial to resist the model of power that would set up racism and homophobia and misogyny as parallel or analogical relations.  The assertion of their abstract or structural equivalence not only misses the specific histories of their construction and elaboration, but also delays the important work of thinking through the ways in which these vectors of power require and deploy each other for the purpose of their own articulation." (18)

rethinking the symbolic:  not quasi-permanent structure of signification, but the temporalized regulation; recasting Lacan via Foucault

Part One
1.  Bodies That Matter

"Within some quarters of feminist theory in recent years, there have been calls to retrieve the body from what is often characterized as the linguistic idealism of poststructuralism." (27)

need to rearticulate matter within poststructuralism in order to create of project of ethical and political value?

"In an effort to displace the terms of this debate, I want to ask how and why 'materiality' has become a sign of irreducibility, that is, how is it that the materiality of sex is understood as that which only bears cultural constructions and, therefore, cannot be a construction?" (28)

"the category of women does not become useless through deconstruction, but becomes one whose uses are no longer reified as 'referents,' and which stand a chance of being opened up, indeed, of coming to signify in ways that none of us can predict in advance." (29)

"Against the claim that poststructuralism reduces all materiality to linguistic stuff, an argument is needed to show that to deconstruct matter is not to negate or do away with the usefulness of the term.  And against those who would claim that the body's irreducible materiality is a necessary precondition for feminist practice, I suggest that that prized materiality may well be constituted through an exclusion and degradation of the feminine that is profoundly problematic for feminism." (29-30)

"To call a presupposition into question is not the same as doing away with it; rather, it is to free it from its metaphysical lodgings in order to understand what political interests were secured in and by that metaphysical placing, and thereby to permit the term to occupy and to serve very different political aims." (30)

"If the body signified as prior to signification is an effect of signification, then the mimetic or representational status of language, which claims that signs follow bodies as their necessary mirrors, is not mimetic at all.  On the contrary, it is productive, constitutive, one might even argue performative..." (30)
Matters of Femininity

classical associations of femininity with materiality (as opposed to form)

"Obviously, no feminist would encourage a simple return to Aristotle's natural teleologies in order to rethink the 'materiality' of bodies.  I want to consider, however, Aristotle's distinction between body and soul to effect a brief comparison between Aristotle and Foucault in order to suggest a possible contemporary redeployment of Aristotelian terminology." (32)
Aristotle/Foucault

"For Aristotle the soul designates the actualization of matter, where matter is understood as fully potential and unactualized." (32)

matter as inseparable from schema

Aristotle's link of materiality and intelligibility used to account for and restrict the female body within the realm of biology and reproduction

"To understand the schema of bodies as a historically contingent nexus of power/discourse is to arrive at something similar to what Foucault describes in Discipline and Punish as the 'materialization' of the prisoner's body." (33)

in D&P, "soul" becomes "an instrument of power through which the body is cultivated and formed" (33); this is "an implicit reworking of the Aristotelian formulation" (33)

soul as subjection, not only in the sense of subordination but also as subjectivation; soul brings the body into 'being'

power constitutes the subject in its materialization, both forming and regulating

to what extent does the materialization of subjects require and institute a domain of radical dematerialization or unintelligibility?

Irigaray:  binary oppositions like form/matter are created through the exclusion of disruptive possibilities; feminine erased in its representation
Irigaray/Plato

Irigaray's occupation of the paternal voice in the history of philosophy -- repeats the same errors, but with intent to expose

"how can one read a text for what does not appear within its own terms, but which nevertheless constitutes the illegible conditions of its own legibility?" (37)

Plato's Timaeus; chora/receptacle associated with feminine body; Irigaray's critique

"In other words, taken as a figure, the nurse-receptable freezes the feminine as that which is necessary for the reproduction of the human but which itself is not human, and which is in no way to be construed as the formative principle of the human form that is, as it were, produced through it." (42); feminine cast outside form/matter binarism

Irigaray's citational relationship with Plato as insubordination; "miming" as the operation of the feminine in language

"figuration of masculine reason as disembodied body" (49)
Improper Entry:  Protocols of Sexual Difference

"The above analysis has considered not the materiality of sex, but the sex of materiality.  In other words, it has traced materiality as the site at which a certain drama of sexual difference plays itself out." (49)

anxieties about improper penetration
Formless Femininity

"...Plato's discourse on materiality (if we take the discourse on hypodoche to be that), is one which does not permit the notion of the female body as a human form." (53)

"Moreover, within Plato, there is a disjunction between a materiality which is feminine and formless and, hence, without a body, and bodies which are formed through -- but not of -- that feminine materiality." (53)

"Here the question is not simply what Plato thought bodies might be, and what of the body remained for him radically unthinkable; rather, the question is whether the forms which are said to produce bodily life operate through the production of an excluded domain that comes to bound and to haunt the field of intelligible bodily life." (54)

2.  The Lesbian Phallus and the Morphological Imaginary

Freud's "On Narcissism" and the relationship of illness to libido, esp. hypochondria -- has "consequences for determining what constitutes a body part at all, and, as we shall see, what constitutes an erotogenic body part in particular." (58)

connection of the formation of the ego to the externalized idea of the body, esp. through pain; rel. of temporal causality which requires the preexistence of the body, actually becomes mutually constitutive

rel. between genitals (male) and other erotogenous zones

phallus as "that which originates or generates significations" (60); to attempt to define is to pose as having the phallus

Freud's attempt to conflate or collapse the distinction between phallus and penis

"Hypochondria here denotes something like a theatrical delineation or production of the body, one which gives imaginary contours to the ego itself, projecting a body which becomes the occasion of an identification which in its imaginary or projected status is fully tenuous." (63)

"The pathologization of erotogenic parts in Freud calls to be read as a discourse produced in guilt, and although the imaginary and projective possibilities of hypochondria are useful, they call to be dissociated from the metaphorics of illness that pervade the description of sexuality.  This is especially urgent not that the pathologization of sexuality generally, and the specific description of homosexuality as the paradigm for the pathological as such, are symptomatic of homophobic discourse on AIDS." (64)

if descriptions of the body occur through imaginary schema, is there a body that escapes such schematization?
"Are Bodies Purely Discursive?"

"To posit a materiality outside of language, where that materiality is considered ontologically distinct from language, is to undermine the possibility that language might be able to indicate or correspond to that domain of radical alterity." (68)

language and materiality as deeply interconnected:  "it is not that one cannot get outside of language in order to grasp materiality in an of itself; rather, every effort to refer to materiality takes place through a signifying process which, in its phenomenality, is always already material." (68)

but what about the specific materiality of the body?

"materiality is constituted in and through iterability" (70)

"The mirror stage is not a developmental account of how the idea of one's own body comes into being.  It does suggest, however, that the capacity to project a morphe, a shape, onto a surface is part of the psychic (and phantasmatic) elaboration, centering, and containment of one's own bodily contours." (71)

"What constitutes the integral body is not a natural boundary or organic telos, but the law of kinship that works through the name.  In this sense, the paternal law produces versions of bodily integrity; the name, which installs gender and kinship, thus works as a politically invested and investing performative." (72)
Rewriting the Morphological Imaginary

"Insofar as the ego is formed from the psyche through projecting the body, and the ego is that projection, the condition of reflexive (mis)knowing, it is invariably a bodily ego." (73)

two problems with Lacanian trajectory:  it is explicitly masculine, and it connects the idealization of the body to the phallus -- the lesbian phallus intervenes to contest these relationships

formation of the ego in relation not to the actual body but to the idealized image of the body

"some parts of the body become the tokens for the centering and controlling function of the bodily imago" (76) -- esp. the organs that become the site of masculine narcissism

in that narcissistic relation, organs cease to be organs and become instead imaginary effects -- one might suggest this is how the penis becomes the phallus, but Lacan insists that the phallus is neither an organ nor an imaginary effect, but a privileged signifier

"this account of the genesis of epistemological relations implies that all knowable objects will have an anthropomorphic and androcentric character.  Secondly, this androcentric character will be phallic." (78)

Lacan's attempts to control the meaning of the term phallus instate him as the one with it

"To claims for the phallus the status of a privileged signifier performatively produces and effects this privilege." (83)

"If the phallus is that which is excommunicated from the feminist orthodoxy on lesbian sexuality as well as the 'missing part,' the sign of an inevitable dissatis-faction that is lesbianism in homophobic and misogynist constructions, then the admission of the phallus into that exchange faces two convergent prohibitions: first, the phallus signifies the persistence of the 'straight mind,' a masculine or hetero-sexist identification and, hence, the defilement or betrayal of lesbian specificity; secondly, the phallus signifies the insuperability of heterosexuality and constitutes lesbianism as a vain and/or pathetic effort to mime the real thing." (85-86)
Conclusion

"Inasmuch as the phallus signifies, it is also always in the process of being signified and resignified.  In this sense, it is not the incipient moment or origin of a signifying chain, as Lacan would insist, but part of a reiterable signifying practice and, hence, open to resignification" (89)

3.  Phantasmatic Identification and the Assumption of Sex

"sexuality cannot be summarily made or unmade, and it would be a mistake to associate 'constructivism' with 'the freedom of a subject to form her/his sexuality as s/he pleases.'  A construction is, after all, not the same as an artifice.  On the contrary, constructivism needs to take account of the domain of constraints without which a certain living and desiring being cannot make its way." (94)

"The 'performative' dimension of construction is precisely the forced reiteration of norms.  In this sense, then, it is not only that there are constraints to performativity; rather, constraint calls to be rethought as the very condition of performativity.  Performativity is neither free play nor theatrical self-presentation; nor can it simply be equated with performance." (94-95)
Identification, Prohibition, and the Instability of "Positions"

"If to assume a sexed position is to identify with a position marked out within the symbolic domain, and if to identify involves fantasizing the possibility of approximating that symbolic site, then the heterosexist constraint that compels the assumption of sex operates through the regulation of phantasmatic identification." (96-97)

identification is always incomplete, not achieved

"Paradoxically, what is invoked by the one who speaks or inscribes the law is the fiction of a speaker who wields the authority to make his words binding, the legal incarnation of the divine utterance." (107)

"the heterosexual presumption of the symbolic domain is that apparently inverted identifications will effectively and exclusively signal abjection rather than pleasure, or signal abjection without at once signaling the possibility of a pleasurable insurrection against the law or an erotic turning of the law against itself." (110)

"the entrance of homosexuality into the symbolic will alter very little if the symbolic itself is not radically altered in the course of that admission.  Indeed, the legitimation of homosexuality will have to resist the force of normalization for a queer resignificaation of the symbolic to expand and later the normativity of its terms." (111)
Political Affiliation Beyond the Logic of Repudiation
Critically Queer

question of "queer" and the reappropriation of slurs; hate speech

"it is not only a question of how discourse injures bodies, but how certain injuries establish certain bodies at the limits of available ontologies, available schemes of intelligibility" (224)
Performative Power

Eve Sedgwick on queer performativity

Austin's focus on marriage ceremony indicates heterosexualization as paradigmatic speech act

performative speech acts are authoritative, but not the product of an individual will; they are rather citational; "will" is produced through citation

performativity as connected to Althusserian interpellation; "recognition is not conferred on a subject, but forms that subject" (226)
Queer Trouble

"a performative 'works' to the extent that it draws on and covers over the constitutive conventions by which it is mobilized" (227)

historicity of discourse suggests that terms can shift meanings, but we may not entirely control those shifts

"We no more create from nothing the political terms that come to represent our 'freedom' than we are responsible for the terms that carry the pain of social injury.  And yet, neither of these terms are as a result any less necessary to work and rework within political discourse." (229)
Gender Performativity and Drag

"what is meant by understanding gender as impersonation?  Does this mean that one puts on a mask or persona, that there is a 'one' who precedes that 'putting on,' who is something other than its gender from the start?  Or does this miming, this impersonating precede and form the 'one,' operating as its formative precondition rather than its indispensable artifice?"  (230)

acknowledgement that in GT she confused matters by "citing drag as an example of performativity, a move that was taken then, by some, to be exemplary of performativity" (230)

"It may seem, however, that there is a difference between the embodying or performing of gender norms and the performative use of discourse.  Are these two different senses of 'performativity,' or do they converge as modes of citationality in which the compulsory character of certain cultural imperatives becomes subject to a more promising deregulation?" (231)
Melancholia and the Limits of Performance

"In no sense can it be concluded that the part of gender that is performed is therefore the 'truth' of gender; performance as bounded 'act' is distinguished from performativity insofar as the latter consists in a reiteration of norms which precede, constrain, and exceed the performer and in that sense cannot be taken as the fabrication of the performer's 'will' or 'choice'; further, what is 'performed' works to conceal, if not to disavow, what remains opaque, unconscious, unperformable.  The reduction of performativity to performance would be a mistake." (234)

"drag exposes or allegorizes the mundane psychic and performative practices by which heterosexual genders form themselves through the renunciation of the possibility of homosexuality, a foreclosure that produces a field of heterosexual objects at the same time that it produces a domain of those whom it would be impossible to love.  Drag thus allegorizes heterosexual melancholy..." (235)
Gendered and Sexual Performativity

"How then does one link the trope by which discourse is described as "performing" and that theatrical sense of performance in which the hyperbolic status of gender norms seems central?  What is 'performed' in drag is, of course, the sign of gender, a sign that is not the same as the body that it figures, but that cannot be read without it." (237)
