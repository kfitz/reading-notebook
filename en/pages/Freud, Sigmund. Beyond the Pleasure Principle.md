Introduction, by Gregory Zilboorg, M.D. (xxv-xxxv)

"Of recent years we have become so accustomed to the atmosphere of controversy which surrounds psychoanalysis and Freud that we have almost lost our capacity to pick up a book on psychoanalysis without wanting to know in advance whether the book is for or against it, or, if it is for it, whether it is for Freud or for Jung, or, if it is Freudian, whether it is orthodox or now-Freudian." (Zilboorg xxv)

"No one, and particularly no genius, is really free of the ideological inheritance which he carries within himself as a child of a given generation.  He may not be aware of it, of course, but Freud would have been the last man in the world to equate not being aware of something with its nonexistence." (Zilboorg xxvii)

"Freud's apparent readiness to change his mind added a great number of dissenters and detractors -- as if the scientist who has the courage to change his mind about some of his own ideas has gained a point against himself.  The great majority of people do confuse stubbornness for consistency, and rigidity of scientific ideas for soundness of position." (Zilboorg xxviii)

"It is because of Freud's aggressive candor, it seems to me, that his earliest followers seem more to have stood in awe, listening to his pronouncements, than actually to have assimilated his thought like true disciples, ready to ask friendly critical questions in order to deepen and broaden the understanding of their master's thought." (Zilboorg xxx)

what is new in _Beyond the Pleasure Principle_: "The concept of 'compulsive repetition' or 'repetition compulsion.'...  Freud discovered the repetitiveness of certain patterns of human behavior and the inevitability or, if you with, the inescapable nature of this repetitiveness.... It is hardly necessary to go into more detail to observe that the compulsive element of which Freud speaks when he speaks of compulsive repetition is something that the individual is *not* conscious of, that the compulsive element in this concept is something which is not neurotic at all, or not necessarily, and that it is just as or no more compulsive than breathing or the changing of the seasons." (Zilboorg xxxi-xxxii)


I.

"... the course taken by mental events is automatically regulated by the pleasure principle.  We believe, that is to say, that the course of those events is invariably set in motion by an unpleasurable tension, and that it takes a direction such that its final outcome coincides with a lowering of that tension -- that is, with an avoidance of unpleasure or a production of pleasure" (Freud 3)

"We have decided to relate pleasure and unpleasure to the quantity of excitation that is present in the mind but is not in any way 'bound'; and to relate them in such a manner that unpleasure corresponds to an *increase* in the quantity of excitation and pleasure to a *diminution*." (Freud 4)

"The facts which have caused us to believe in the dominance of the pleasure principle in mental life also find expression in the hypothesis that the mental apparatus endeavours to keep the quantity of excitation present in it as low as possible or at least to keep it constant." (Freud 5)

"The pleasure principle follows from the principle of constancy: actually, the latter principle was inferred from the facts which forced us to adopt the pleasure principle." (Freud 6)

"It must be pointed out, however, that strictly speaking it is incorrect to talk of the dominance of the pleasure principle over the course of mental processes.  If such a dominance existed, the immense majority of our mental processes would have to be accompanied by pleasure or to lead to pleasure, whereas universal experience completely contradicts any such conclusion.  The most that can be said, therefore, is that there exists in the mind a strong *tendency* towards the pleasure principle, but that that tendency is opposed by certain other forces or circumstances, so that the final outcome cannot always be in harmony with the tendency towards pleasure." (Freud 6)

"We know that the pleasure principle is proper to a *primary* method of working on the part of the mental apparatus, but that, from the point of view of the self-preservation of the organism among the difficulties of the external world, it is from the very outset inefficient and even highly dangerous.  Under the influence of the ego's instincts of self-preservation, the pleasure principle is replaced by the *reality principle*.  This latter principle does not abandon the intention of ultimately obtaining pleasure, but it nevertheless demands and carries into effect the postponement of satisfaction, the abandonment of a number of possibilities of gaining satisfaction and the temporary toleration of unpleasure as a step on the long indirect road to pleasure." (Freud 7)

"The details of the process by which repression turns a possibility of pleasure into a source of unpleasure are not yet clearly understood or cannot be clearly represented; but there is no doubt that all neurotic unpleasure is of that kind -- pleasure that cannot be felt as such." (Freud 8)

"Most of the unpleasure that we experience is *perceptual* unpleasure." (Freud 9)


II.

"A condition has long been known and described which occurs after severe mechanical concussions, railway disasters and other accidents involving a risk to life; it has been given the name of 'traumatic neurosis'." (Freud 10)

"In the case of ordinary traumatic neuroses two characteristics emerge prominently: first, that the chief weight in their causation seems to rest upon the factor of surprise, of fright; and secondly, that a wound or injury inflicted simultaneously works as a rule *against* the development of a neurosis." (Freud 11)

"I do not believe that anxiety can produce a traumatic neurosis.  There is something about anxiety that protects its subject against fright and so against fright-neuroses." (Freud 11)

"If we are not to be shaken in our belief in the wish-fulfilling tenor of dreams by the dreams of traumatic neurotics, we still have one resource open to us: we may argue that the function of dreaming, like so much else, is upset in this condition and diverted from its purposes, or we may be driven to reflect on the mysterious masochistic trends of the ego." (Freud 12)

"Without wishing to include the whole field covered by these phenomena, I have been able, through a chance opportunity which presented itself, to throw some light upon the first game played by a little boy of one and a half and invented by himself.  It was more than a mere fleeting observation, for I lived under the same roof as the child and his parents for some weeks, and it was some time before I discovered the meaning of the puzzling activity which he constantly repeated." (Freud 13)

"above all he never cried when his mother left him for a few hours.  At the same time, he was greatly attached to his mother, who had not only fed him herself but had also looked after him without any outside help.  This good little boy, however, had an occasional disturbing habit of taking any small objects he could get hold of and throwing them away from him into a corner, under the bed, and so on, so that hunting for his toys and picking them up was often quite a business.  As he did this he gave vent to a loud, long-drawn-out 'o-o-o-o', accompanied by an expression of interest and satisfaction.  His mother and the writer of the present account were agreed in thinking that this was not a mere interjection but represented the German word 'fort' ['gone']." (Freud 13-14)

"What he did was to hold the reel by the string and very skilfully throw it over the edge of his curtained cot, so that it disappeared into it, at the same time uttering his expressive 'o-o-o-o'.  He then pulled the reel out of the cot again by the string and hailed its reappearance with a joyful '*da*' ['there'].  This, then, was the complete game -- disappearance and return." (Freud 14)

"The interpretation of the game then became obvious.  It was related to the child's great cultural achievement -- the instinctual renunciation (that is, the renunciation of instinctual satisfaction) which he had made in allowing his mother to go away without protesting.  He compensated himself by staging the disappearance and return of the objects within his reach." (Freud 14)

"The child cannot possibly have felt his mother's departure as something agreeable or even indifferent.  How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?" (Freud 15)

"At the outset he was in a *passive* situation -- he was overpowered by the experience; but, by repeating it, unpleasurable though it was, as a game, he took on and *active* part.  These efforts might be put down to an instinct for mastery that was acting independently of whether the memory was in itself pleasurable or not.  But still another interpretation may be attempted.  Throwing away the object so that it was 'gone' might satisfy an impulse of the child's, which was suppressed in his actual life, to revenge himself on his mother for going away from him.  In that case it would have a defiant meaning:  'All right, then, go away!  I don't need you.  I'm sending you away myself.'  A year later, the same boy whom I had observed at his first game used to take a toy, if he was angry with it, and throw it on the floor, exclaiming 'Go to the fwont!'  He had heard at that time that his absent father was 'at the front', and was far from regretting his absence; on the contrary he made it quite clear that he had no desire to be disturbed in his sole possession of his mother.  We know of other children who liked to express similar hostile impulses by throwing away objects instead of persons.  We are therefore left in doubt as to whether the impulse to work over in the mind some overpowering experience so as to make oneself master of it can find expression as a primary event, and independently of the pleasure principle." (Freud 15-16)

"As the child passes over from the passivity of the experience to the activity of the game, he hands on the disagreeable experience to one of his playmates and in this way revenges himself on a substitute." (Freud 16-17)

"even under the dominance of the pleasure principle, there are ways and means enough of making what is in itself unpleasurable into a subject to be recollected and worked over in the mind." (Freud 17)


III.

"At first the analysing physician could do no more than discover the unconscious material that was concealed from the patient, put it together, and, at the right moment, communicate it to him.  Psycho-analysis was then first and foremost an art of interpreting." (Freud 18)

"a further aim quickly came into view: to oblige the patient to confirm the analyst's construction from his own memory.  In that endeavour the chief emphasis lay upon the patient's resistances: the art consisted now in uncovering these as quickly as possible, in pointing them out to the patient and in inducing him by human influence -- this was where suggestion operating as 'transference' played its part -- to abandon his resistances." (Freud 18)

"He is obliged to *repeat* the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of, as the physician would prefer to see, *remembering* it as something belonging to the past." (Freud 19)

"It has been the physician's endeavour to keep this transference neurosis within the narrowest limits: to force as much as possible into the channel of memory and to allow as little as possible to emerge as repetition." (Freud 19)

"In order to make it easier to understand this 'compulsion to repeat', which emerges during the psycho-analytic treatment of neurotics, we must above all get rid of the mistaken notion that what we are dealing with in our struggle against resistances is resistance on the part of the *unconscious*." (Freud 19-20)

"Resistance during treatment arises from the same higher strata and systems of the mind which originally carried out repression.  But the fact that, as we know from experience, the motives of the resistances, and indeed the resistances themselves, are unconscious at first during the treatment, is a hint to use that we should correct a shortcoming in our terminology.  We shall avoid a lack of clarity if we make our contrast not between the conscious and the unconscious but between the coherent *ego* and the *repressed*." (Freud 20)

"we can say that the patient's resistance arises from his ego, and we than at once perceive that the compulsion to repeat must be ascribed to the unconscious repressed." (Freud 20)

"There is no doubt that the resistance of the conscious and unconscious ego operates under the sway of the pleasure principle: it seeks to avoid the unpleasure which would be produced by the liberation of the repressed.  *Our* efforts, on the other hand, are directed towards procuring the toleration of that unpleasure by an appeal to the reality principle.  But how is the compulsion to repeat -- the manifestation of the power of the repressed -- related to the pleasure principle?" (Freud 21)

"the compulsion to repeat also recalls from the past experiences which include no possibility of pleasure, and which never, even long ago, have brought satisfaction even to instinctual impulses which have since been repressed." (Freud 21)

"Patients repeat all of these unwanted situations and painful emotions in the transference and revive them with the greatest ingenuity.  They seek to bring about the interruption of the treatment while it is still incomplete; they contrive once more to feel themselves scorned, to oblige the physician to speak severely to them and treat them coldly; they discover appropriate objects for their jealousy; instead of the passionately desired baby of their childhood, they produce a plan or a promise of some grand present -- which turns out as a rule to be unreal.  None of these things can have produced pleasure in the past, and it might be supposed that they would cause less unpleasure to-day if they emerged as memories or dreams instead of taking the form of fresh experiences." (Freud 22)

"we have come across people all of whose human relationships have the same outcome: such as the benefactor who is abandoned in anger after a time by each of his *protégés*, however much they may otherwise differ from one another, and who thus seems doomed to taste all the bitterness of ingratitude; or the man who [sic] friendships all end in betrayal by his friend; or the man who time after time in the course of his life raises someone else into a position of great private or public authority and then, after a certain interval, himself upsets that authority and replaces him by a new one; or, again, the lover each of whose love affairs with a woman passes through the same phases and reaches the same conclusion." (Freud 23)

"We are much more impressed by cases where the subject appears to have a *passive* experience, over which he has no influence, but in which he meets with a repetition of the same fatality." (Freud 24)

"there really does exist in the mind a compulsion to repeat which overrides the pleasure principle." (Freud 24)


IV.

"Psycho-analytic speculation takes as its point of departure the impression, derived from examining unconscious processes, that consciousness may be, not the most universal attribute of mental processes, but only a particular function of them.  Speaking in metapsychological terms, it asserts that consciousness is a function of a particular system which it describes as *Cs*.  What consciousness yields consists essentially of perceptions of excitations coming form the external world and of feelings of pleasure and unpleasure which can only arise from within the mental apparatus" (Freud 26)

"Thus we should be able to say that the excitatory process becomes conscious in the system *Cs* but leaves no permanent trace behind there; but that the excitation is transmitted to the systems lying next within and that it is in *them* that its traces are left."  (Freud 28)

"embryology, in its capacity as a recapitulation of developmental history, actually shows us that the central nervous system originates from the ectoderm; the grey matter of the cortex remains a derivative of the primitive superficial layer of the organism and may have inherited some of its essential properties." (Freud 29)

"This little fragment of living substance is suspended in the middle of an external world charged with the most powerful energies; and it would be killed by the stimulation emanating from these if it were not provided with a protective shield against stimuli.  It acquires the shield in this way:  its outermost surface ceases to have the structure proper to living matter, becomes to some degree inorganic and thenceforward functions as a special envelope or membrane resistant to stimuli.  In consequence, the energies of the external world are able to pass into the next underlying layers, which have remained living, with only a fragment of their original intensity; and these layers can devote themselves, behind the protective shield, to the reception of the amounts of stimulus which have been allowed through it.  By its death, the outer layer has saved all the deeper ones from a similar fate -- unless, that is to say, stimuli reach it which are so strong that they break through the protective shield.  *Protection against* stimuli is an almost more important function for the living organism than *reception of* stimuli." (Freud 30)

"This state of things produces two definite results.  First, the feelings of pleasure and unpleasure (which are an index to what is happening in the interior of the apparatus) predominate over all external stimuli.  And secondly, a particular way is adopted of dealing with any internal excitations which produce too great an increase of unpleasure: there is a tendency to treat them as though they were acting, not from the inside, but from the outside, so that it may be possible to bring the shield against stimuli into operation as a means of defence against them.  This is the origin of *projection*, which is destined to play such a large part in the causation of pathological processes." (Freud 33)

"We describe as 'traumatic' any excitations from outside which are powerful enough to break through the protective shield." (Freud 33)

"Nor do the very violent phenomena of discharge to which pain gives rise affect our explanation, for they occur in a reflex manner -- that is, they follow without the intervention of the mental apparatus." (Freud 35)

"We may, I think, tentatively venture to regard the common traumatic neurosis as a consequence of an extensive breach being made in the protective shield against stimuli." (Freud 35)

"The fulfilment of wishes is, as we know, brought about in a hallucinatory manner by dreams, and under the dominance of the pleasure principle this has become their function.  But it is not in the service of that principle that the dreams of patients suffering from traumatic neuroses lead them back with such regularity to the situation in which the trauma occurred.  We may assume, rather, that dreams are helping to carry out another task, which must be accomplished before the dominance of the pleasure principle can even begin." (Freud 36)

"This would seem to be the place, then, at which to admit for the first time an exception to the proposition that dreams are fulfilments of wishes.  Anxiety dreams, as I have shown repeatedly and in detail, offer no such exception.  Nor do 'punishment dreams', for they merely replace the forbidden wish-fulfilment by the appropriate punishment for it; that is to say, they fulfil the wish of the sense of guilt which is the reaction to the repudiated impulse.  But it is impossible to classify as wish-fulfilments the dreams we have been discussing which occur in traumatic neuroses, or the dreams during psycho-analyses which bring to memory the psychical traumas of childhood.  They arise, rather, in obedience to the compulsion to repeat....  Thus it would seem that the function of dreams, which consists in setting aside any motives that might interrupt sleep, by fulfilling the wishes of the disturbing impulses, is not their *original* function." (Freud 37)

"May not dreams which, with a view to the psychical binding of traumatic impressions, obey the compulsion to repeat -- may not such dreams occur *outside* analysis as well?  And the reply can only be a decided affirmative." (Freud 38)

"The fact to which I have referred on pages 10-11, that a gross physical injury caused simultaneously by the trauma diminishes the chances that a neurosis will develop, becomes intelligible if one bears in mind two facts which have been stressed by psycho-analytic research: firstly, that mechanical agitation must be recognized as one of the sources of sexual excitation, and secondly, that painful and feverish illnesses exercise a powerful effect, so long as they last, on the distribution of libido." (Freud 38)


V.

"The most abundant sources of this internal excitation are what are described as the organism's 'instincts' -- the representatives of all the forces originating in the interior of the body and transmitted to the mental apparatus -- at once the most important and the most obscure element of psychological research." (Freud 40)

"I described the type of process found in the unconscious as the 'primary' psychical process, in contradistinction to the 'secondary' process which is the one obtaining in our normal waking life.  Since all instinctual impulses have the unconscious systems as their point of impact, it is hardly an innovation to say that they obey the primary process." (Freud 41)

"Novelty is always the condition of enjoyment.  But children will never tire of asking an adult to repeat a game that he has shown them or played with them, till he is too exhausted to go on." (Freud 42)

"None of this contradicts the pleasure principle; repetition, the re-experiencing of something identical, is clearly in itself a source of pleasure.  In the case of a person in analysis, on the contrary, the compulsion to repeat the events of his childhood in the transference evidently disregards the pleasure principle in every way." (Freud 42)

"It may be presumed, too, that when people unfamiliar with analysis feel an obscure fear -- a dread of rousing something that, so they feel, is better left sleeping -- what they are afraid of at bottom is the emergence of this compulsion with its hint of possession by some 'daemonic' power." (Freud 43)

"a universal attribute of instincts and perhaps of organic life in general which has not hitherto been clearly recognized or at least not explicitly stressed.  *It seems, then, that an instinct is an urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things* which the living entity has been obliged to abandon under the pressure of external disturbing forces; that is, it is a kind of organic elasticity, or, to put it another way, the expression of the inertia inherent in organic life."  (Freud 43)

"an expression of the *conservative* nature of living substance." (Freud 43)

"We see how the germ of a living animal is obliged in the course of its development to recapitulate (even if only in a transient and abbreviated fashion) the structures of all the forms from which it is sprung, instead of proceeding quickly by the shortest path to its final shape." (Freud 44)

"We shall be met by the plausible objection that it may very well be that, in addition to the conservative instincts which impel towards repetition, there may be others which push forward towards progress and the production of new forms.  This argument must certainly not be overlooked, and it will be taken into account at a later stage." (Freud 44)

"Those instincts are therefore bound to give a deceptive appearance of being forces tending toward change and progress, whilst in fact they are merely seeking to reach an ancient goal by paths alike old and new.  Moreover, it is possible to specify this final goal of all organic striving.  It would be in contradiction to the conservative nature of the instincts if the goal of life were a state of things which had never yet been attained.  On the contrary, it must be an *old* state of things, an initial state from which the living entity has at one time or other departed and to which it is striving to return by the circuitous paths along which its development leads.  If we are to take it as a truth that knows no exception that everything living dies for *internal* reasons -- becomes inorganic once again -- then we shall be compelled to say that '*the aime of all life is death*' and, looking backwards, that '*inanimate things existed before living ones*'." (Freud 45-46)

"In this way the first instinct came into being: the instinct to return to the inanimate state." (Freud 46)

"For a long time, perhaps, living substance was thus being constantly created afresh and easily dying, till decisive external influences altered in such a way as to oblige the still surviving substance to diverge ever more widely from its original course of life and to make ever more complicated *détours* before reaching its aim of death." (Freud 46)

"The hypothesis of self-preservative instincts, such as we attribute to all living beings, stands in marked opposition to the idea that instinctual life as a whole serves to bring about death.  Seen in this light, the theoretical importance of the instincts of self-preservation, of self-assertion and of mastery greatly diminishes.  They are component instincts whose function it is to assure that the organism shall follow its own path to death, and to ward off any possible ways of returning to inorganic existence other than those which are immanent in the organism itself." (Freud 46-47)

"the organism wishes to die only in its own fashion.... Hence arises the paradoxical situation that the living organism struggles most energetically against events (dangers, in fact) which might help it to attain its life's aim rapidly -- by a kind of short-circuit.  Such behaviour is, however, precisely what characterizes purely instinctual as contrasted with intelligent efforts." (Freud 47)

"These germ-cells, therefore, work against the death of the living substance and succeed in winning for it what we can only regard as potential immortality, though that may mean no more than a lengthening of the road to death.  We must regard as in the highest degree significant the fact that this function of the germ-cell is reinforced, or only made possible, if it coalesces with another cell similar to itself and yet differing from it." (Freud 48) -- see Lee Edelman, _No Future_

"the sexual instincts.  They are conservative in the same sense as the other instincts in that they bring back earlier states of living substance; but they are conservative to a higher degree in that they are peculiarly resistant to external influences; and they are conservative too in another sense in that they preserve life itself for a comparatively long period.  They are the true life instincts.  They operate against the purpose of the other instincts, which leads, by reason of their function, to death; and this fact indicates that there is an opposition whose importance was long ago recognized by the theory of the neuroses." (Freud 48-49)

"What appears in a minority of human individuals as an untiring impulsion towards further perfection can easily be understood as a result of the instinctual repression upon which is based all that is most precious in human civilization." (Freud 50)


VI.

"The upshot of our enquiry so far has been the drawing of a sharp distinction between the 'ego-instincts' and the sexual instincts, and the view that the former exercise pressure towards death and the latter towards a prolongation of life.  But this conclusion is bound to be unsatisfactory in many respects even to ourselves." (Freud 52)

"If we are to die ourselves, and first to lose in death those who are dearest to us, it is easier to submit to a remorseless law of nature, to the sublime Necessity, than to a chance which might perhaps have been escaped." (Freud 53)

[lots of stuff about reproduction amongst single-celled organisms and the ways that sexual reproduction seems to lend longer life]

"Advancing more cautiously, psycho-analysis observed the regularity with which libido is withdrawn from the object and directed onto the ego (the process of introversion); and, by studying the libidinal development of children in its earliest phases, came to the conclusion that the ego is the true and original reservoir of libido, and that it is only from that reservoir that libido is extended onto objects." (Freud 62)

"Thus the original opposition between the ego-instincts and the sexual instincts proved to be inadequate.  A portion of the ego-instincts was seen to be libidinal; sexual instincts -- probably alongside others -- operated in the ego.  Nevertheless we are justified in saying that the old formula which lays it down that psychoneuroses are based on a conflict between ego-instincts and sexual instincts contains nothing that we need reject to-day." (Freud 62)

"If the self-preservative instincts too are of a libidinal nature, are there perhaps no other instincts whatever but the libidinal ones?" (Freud 63)

"Our views have from the very first been *dualistic*, and to-day they are even more definitely dualistic than before -- now that we describe the opposition as being, not between ego-instincts and sexual instincts but between life instincts and death instincts." (Freud 63-64)

"We started out with the great opposition between the life and death instincts.  Now object-love presents us with a second example of a similar polarity -- that between love (or affection) and hate (or aggressiveness).  If only we could succeed in relating these two polarities to each other and in deriving one from the other!  From the very first we recognized the presence of a sadistic component in the sexual instinct." (Freud 64)

"But how can the sadistic instinct, whose aim it is to injure the object, be derived from Eros, the preserver of life?  Is it not plausible to suppose that this sadism is in fact a death instinct which, under the influence of the narcissistic libido, has been forced away from the ego and has consequently only emerged in relation to the object?"  (Freud 65)

"Clinical observations led us at that time to the view that masochism, the component instinct which is complementary to sadism, must be regarded as sadism that has been turned around upon the subject's own ego.  But there is no difference in principle between and instinct turning from an object to the ego and its turning from the ego to an object -- which is the new point now under discussion.  Masochism, the turning round of the instinct upon the subject's own ego, would in that case be a return to an earlier phase of the instinct's history, a regression." (Freud 66)

"This tallies well with the hypothesis that the life process of the individual leads for internal reasons to an abolition of chemical tensions, that is to say, to death, whereas union with the living substance of a different individual increases those tensions, introducing what may be described as fresh 'vital difference' which must then be lived off." (Freud 67)

"It may be asked whether and how far I am myself convinced of the truth of the hypotheses that have been set out in these pages.  My answer would be that I am not convinced myself and that I do not seek to persuade other people to believe in them.  Or, more precisely, that I do not know how far I believe in them.  There is no reason, as it seems to me, why the emotional factor of conviction should enter into this question at all." (Freud 71)


VII.

"The pleasure principle, then, is a tendency operating in the service of a function whose business it is to free the mental apparatus entirely from excitation or to keep the amount of excitation in it constant or to keep it as low as possible." (Freud 76)

"We have all experienced how the greatest pleasure attainable by us, that of the sexual act, is associated with a momentary extinction of a highly intensified excitation.  The binding of an instinctual impulse would be a preliminary function designed to prepare the excitation for its final elimination in the pleasure of discharge."  (Freud 76)

"Another striking fact is that the life instincts have so much more contact with our internal perception -- emerging as breakers of the peace and constantly producing tensions whose release is felt as pleasure -- while the death instincts seem to do their work unobtrusively.  The pleasure principle seems actually to serve the death instincts." (Freud 77)
