Lessig, Lawrence. Code: Version 2.0. New York: Basic Books, 2006.  (Originally published as Code, 1999.)


"much of this book is about the expanding architecture of regulation that the Internet will become" (Lessig xv)

"How do we protect liberty when the architectures of control are managed as much by the government as by the private sector?  How do we assure privacy when the ether perpetually spies?  How do we guarantee free thought when the push is to propertize every idea?  How do we guarantee self-determination when the architectures of control are perpetually determined elsewhere?" (Lessig xv)

"Why was cyberspace incapable of regulation?  What made it so?  The word itself suggests not freedom but control.  Its etymology reaches beyond a novel by William Gibson (*Neuromancer*, published in 1984) to the world of 'cybernetics,' the study of control at a distance through devices.  So it was doubly puzzling to see this celebration of 'perfect freedom' under a banner that aspires (to anyone who knows the origin, at least) to perfect control." (Lessig 3)

"I believe that these first thoughts about government and cyberspace were just as misguided as the first thoughts about government after communism.  Liberty in cyberspace will not come from the absence of the state.  Liberty there, as anywhere, will come from a state of a certain kind.  We build a world where freedom can flourish not by removing from society any self-conscious control, but by setting it in a place where a particular kind of self-conscious control survives.  We build liberty as our founders did, by setting society upon a certain *constitution*." (Lessig 4)

"the argument of this book is that the invisible hand of cyberspace is building an architecture that is quite the opposite of its architecture at its birth.  This invisible hand, pushed by government and by commerce, is constructing an architecture that will perfect control and make highly efficient regulation possible.  The struggle in that world will not be the government's.  It will be to assure that essential liberties are preserved in this environment of perfect control." (Lessig 4)

"This book is about the change from a cyberspace of anarchy to a cyberspace of control." (Lessig 5)

"In real space, we recognize how laws regulate -- through constitutions, statutes, and other legal codes.  In cyberspace we must understand how a different 'code' regulates -- how the software and hardware (i.e., the 'code' of cyberspace) that make cyberspace what it is also regulate cyberspace as it is." (Lessig 5)

"Both 'on the Internet' and 'in cyberspace,' technology constitutes the environment of the space, and it will give us a much wider range of control over how interactions work in that space than in real space.  Problems can be programmed or 'coded' into the story, and they can be 'coded' away." (Lessig 15)

four themes: regulability, regulation by code, latent ambiguity, competing sovereigns

"underlying everything in this book is a single normative plea:  that all of us must learn at least enough to see that technology is plastic.  It can be remade to do things differently.  And that if there is a mistake that we who know too little about technology should make, it is the mistake of imagining technology to be too plastic, rather than not plastic enough.  We should expect -- and demand -- that it can be made to reflect any set of values that we think important.  The burden should be on the technologists to show us why that demand can't be met." (Lessig 32)

"Code is a regulator in cyberspace because it defines the terms upon which cyberspace is offered.  And those who set those terms increasingly recognize the code as a means to achieving the behaviors that benefit them best."  (Lessig 84)

"However much one romanticizes the old days when the Net was a place for conversation and exchange, this is not its function for most of its users now.  There are exploding communities of bloggers and creativity.  But bloggers are still just 3 percent of Internet users; the vast majority of Internet use has no connection to any ideal of community." (Lessig 85) -- this was published in 2006; how would his reading change now?  Interestingly this comment seems to resituate BBS culture as the prehistory of blogging/social network systems/etc

"What means would bring about the most efficient set of protections for property interests in cyberspace? Two sorts of protections are possible. One is the traditional protection of law — the law defines a space where others should not enter and punishes people who enter nonetheless. The other protection is a fence, a technological device (a bit of code) that (among other things) blocks the unwanted from entering." (Lessig 169)

"Roughly put, copyright gives a copyright holder certain exclusive rights over the work, including, most famously, the exclusive right to copy the work. I have a copyright in this book. That means, among other rights, and subject to some important exceptions, you cannot copy this book without my permission." (Lessig 171)

"copyright has always been at war with technology. Before the printing press, there was not much need to protect an author’s interest in his creative work. Copying was so expensive that nature itself protected that interest. But as the cost of copying decreased, and the spread of technologies for copying increased, the threat to the author’s control increased. As each generation has delivered a technology better than the last, the ability of the copyright holder to protect her intellectual property has been weakened." (Lessig 172)

the power of digital rights management schemes and other code to control intellectual property:  "We are not entering a time when copyright is more threatened than it is in real space. We are instead entering a time when copyright is more effectively protected than at any time since Gutenberg. The power to regulate access to and use of copyrighted material is about to be perfected. Whatever the mavens of the mid-1990s may have thought, cyberspace is about to give holders of copyrighted property the biggest gift of protection they have ever known." (Lessig 175)

"the lesson in the future will be that copyright is protected far too well. The problem will center not on copy-right but on copy-duty—the duty of owners of protected property to make that property accessible." (Lessig 175)

"Things are different with intellectual property. If you 'take' my idea, I still have it. If I tell you an idea, you have not deprived me of it. An unavoidable feature of intellectual property is that its consumption, as the economists like to put it, is 'nonrivalrous.' Your consumption does not lessen mine." (Lessig 181)

"If a novelist cannot stop you from copying (rather than buying) her book, then she may have very little incentive to produce more books. She may have as much as she had before you took the work she produced, but if you take it without paying, she has no monetary incentive to produce more." (Lessig 183)

"Intellectual property rights are a monopoly that the state gives to producers of intellectual property in exchange for their production of it. After a limited time, the product of their work becomes the public’s to use as it wants. This is Communism at the core of our Constitution’s protection of intellectual property. This 'property' is not property in the ordinary sense of that term." (Lessig 184)

conventional intellectual property law balances the rights of the creator with the rights of the user; "When intellectual property is protected by code, nothing requires that the same balance be struck. Nothing requires the owner to grant the right of fair use." (Lessig 185)

"This technical fact about digital technologies, tied to the technical architecture of the law, produces a profound shift in the scope or reach of the law of copyright that too many simply miss: While in the analog world, life was sans copyright law; in the digital world, life is subject to copyright law. Every single act triggers the law of copyright. Every single use is either subject to a license or illegal, unless deemed to be 'fair use.' The emergence of digital technologies has thus radically increased the domain of copyright law — from regulating a tiny portion of human life, to regulating absolutely every bit of life on a computer." (Lessig 193)

"digital technologies have radically expanded the scope of this amateur culture. Now the clever remix of some political event or the latest song by your favorite band are not just something you can share with your friends. Digital technologies have made it simple to capture and share this creativity with the world. The single most important difference between the Internet circa 1999 and the Internet circa today is the explosion of user-generated creativity — from blogs, to podcasts, to videocasts, to mashups, the Internet today is a space of extraordinary creativity." (Lessig 194)

"to the extent this creativity finds its expression on the Net, it is now subject to the regulation of copyright law. To the extent it uses others’ creativity, it needs the permission of others. To the extent it builds upon the creativity of others, it needs to be sure that that creativity can be built upon legally. A whole system of regulation has now been grafted upon an economy of creativity that until now has never known regulation. Amateur culture, or bottom up culture, or the culture that lives outside of commercial transactions — all of this is subject to regulation in a way that 30 years ago it was not." (Lessig 195)

"As the architecture of the Internet changes, it will allow for a greater protection of intellectual property than real-space architectures allowed; this greater protection will force a choice on us that we do not need to make in real space. Should the architecture allow perfect control over intellectual property, or should we build into the architecture an incompleteness that guarantees a certain aspect of public use or a certain space for individual freedom?" (Lessig 196)

"Our past had a commons that could not be designed away; that commons gave our culture great value. What value the commons of the future could bring us is something we are just beginning to see." (Lessig 198)

"While the monopoly right of copyright makes sense in certain commercial contexts, or more broadly, makes sense where it is necessary to 'promote... progress,' there is no legitimate reason to burden the vast majority of creative expression with the burdens of copyright law.  That a kid making a video book report needs to clear permissions with the author of the book, or that friends making a mashup of a favorite artist can't do so unless the label has granted them permission, extends the reach of copyright beyond any legitimate purpose." (Lessig 269-70)

"But the single most interesting nondevelopment in cyberspace is that, again, as Castronova puts it, 'one does not find much democracy at all in synthetic worlds.'" (Lessig 285)
