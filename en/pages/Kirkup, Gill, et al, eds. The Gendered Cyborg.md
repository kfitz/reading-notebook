Introduction

“the interrelationship between representation, technoscience, and gender, explored through the metaphor of the cyborg” (Kirkup xiii)


Part One:  Representing gender in technoscience

Kirkup, Gill.  “Introduction to Part One.” 3-10.

Sandra Harding:  gender as a property of individuals, social structures, and symbolic systems; gender relations are power relations

“Technoscientific knowledge contributes to the production of gender through its forms of representation, while itself being a gendered practice.” (Kirkup 3)

gender seen in 70s/80s as social construction based on biology; biology has come to be seen as a discourse that creates sex difference — leading to the uncomfortable sense of having deconstructed the category “woman,” on which second-wave feminism was based

feminist critiques work to deconstruct and undermine patriarchal dichotomies of gender, but new conceptual tools must replace them; enter the cyborg

“Although Haraway famously concludes her article ‘I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess’, the question remains:  Is it better to be a cyborg than a woman?” (Kirkup 5)

Schiebinger:  Linnaeus’s taxonomy asserts that it is a masculine characteristic (reason) that differentiates human beings from animals, and a feminine characteristic (suckling young) that provides commonality with them

“For Descartes, animals were a kind of machine, made by God, with very small parts.  Human beings were not machines/automata like animals because of the power of rational thought and consciousness.  When women are put closer to animals they are also placed closer to machines.” (Kirkup 6)

Kaufman-Osborn:  “tools and machines should not be seen as in a different category to bodies but as extensions of them” (Kirkup 8)

how is the cyborg’s dissolution of the animal/human, animate/inanimate boundaries useful to a consideration of gender?

González:  challenges Haraway’s contention that the cyborg is a creature outside history, and that the cyborg transcends gender and race categories; cyborg failing in its promise

Lykke:  cyborg metaphor helps feminism transcend the Snovian disjunction, addressing the boundary between objectivity and constructionism


Schiebinger, Londa.  “Taxonomy for Human Beings.” 11-37.

Linnaeus introduces mammalia into zoological taxonomy in 1758; means “of the breast” — political act of naming:  mammalness is inherent in the female

historical moment of political realignment: elimination of wet-nursing; redefinition of the maternal role; undermining women’s public power

could appear to be a new valuation of the female principle; but must note that same volume introduces the term Homo sapiens to distinguish humans from other primates/mammals, thus labeling reason as the uniquely human quality

thus:  a feminine characteristic makes humans part of a group of animals, but a masculine characteristic distinguishes humans from that group

ergo, woman resides nearer the beast than man

politics of focus on breast: redefining women in terms of maternalness and domesticity; naturalizing the withdrawal of public power from women

role of the great chain of being in reifying hierarchies of race and gender

the Hottentot Venus; obsession with black women’s breasts and genitalia


Stepan, Nancy Leys.  “Race and Gender:  The Role of Analogy in Science.” 38-49.

role of metaphor in scientific theory unexamined, because of science’s assumptions of empiricism, neutrality, and universalism

“Because science has been identified with truthfulness and empirical reality, the metaphorical nature of much modern science tended to go unrecognized.  And because it went unrecognized, as Colin Turbayne has pointed out, it has been easy to mistake the model in science ‘for the thing modelled’ — to think, to take his example, that nature was mechanical, rather than to think it was, metaphorically, seen as mechanical.” (Stepan 38)

analogy linking race to gender: “In short, lower races represented the ‘female’ type of the human species, and females the ‘lower race’ of gender.” (Stepan 39)

but analogy is about more than race and gender:  “Through an intertwined and overlapping series of analogies, involving often quite complex comparisons, identifications, cross-references, and evoked associations, a variety of ‘differences’ — physical and psychical, class and national — were brought together in a biosocial science of human variation.” (Stepan 40)

Lakoff and Johnson on metaphor; Max Black on “interaction” theory of metaphor (metaphors do not tell us factual things, but instead bring two unrelated things into interaction)

“because a metaphor or analogy does not directly present a pre-existing nature but instead helps ‘construct’ that nature, the metaphor generates data that conform to it, and accommodates data that are in apparent contradiction to it, so that nature is seen via the metaphor and the metaphor becomes part of the logic of science itself.” (Stepan 47)


Haraway, Donna J.  “A Manifesto for Cyborgs:  Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s.” 50-57.

(see notes elsewhere)


González, Jennifer.  “Envisioning Cyborg Bodies:  Notes from Current Research.” 58-73.

cyborg not merely fantasy, but real; “Visual representations of cyborgs are thus not only utopian or dystopian prophecies, but are rather reflections of a contemporary state of being.” (González 58)

types of cyborgs:  organic and mechanical; representations of both are metaphors for cyborg consciousness


Julien Offray de la Mettrie, “L’Homme Machine” (1748)

“artists, depicting an experience already lived by a large portion of the population, were reflecting a situation in which the relation — and the distinction — between the machine and the human became a question of gender and class.  Those who had access to certain machines were privileged, those who were expected to behave like certain machines were subjugated.” (González 60)

reading of L’Horlogère — “The woman is a clock, the clock is a woman — complex, mechanical, serviceable, decorative.” (González 60)

“L’Horlogère is not merely an automaton.  As part human, she should have human agency, or some form of human being.  Her implied space of agency is, nevertheless, tightly circumscribed.  This cyborg appears more trapped by her mechanical parts than liberated through them.” (González 61)

“despite the potentially progressive implications of a cyborg subject position, the cyborg is not necessarily more likely to exist free of the social constraints which apply to humans and machines already.” (González 61)

“The image of the cyborg has historically recurred at moments of radical social and cultural change.” (González 61); “when the current ontological model of human being does not fit a new paradigm, a hybrid model of existence is required to encompass a new, complex and contradictory lived experience.  The cyborg body thus becomes the historical record of changes in human perception.” (González 61)

relationship between representations of cyborgs and representations of “race” and racial mixtures; “a general tendency to link the ‘otherness’ of the machine with the otherness of racial and sexual difference” (González 68)


Lykke, Nina.  “Between Monsters, Goddesses and Cyborgs:  Feminist Confrontations with Science.” 74-87.

explorations of the discursive spaces in which feminism can confront science via the metaphors of monsters, goddesses, and cyborgs

monster metaphor as representation of boundary between cultural and natural sciences, and between human and nonhuman; goddesses and cyborgs used to invoke the border between the artefactual and the natural

“My purpose is to map out a space for a non-dichotomic conversation about feminist alternatives to the traditional scientific reduction of the non-human world to resources and mere objects without subjectivity.” (Lykke 75)

Snow’s two cultures still applicable, despite interdisciplinary attempts to break down divide

“When science is reconsidered as a socio-cultural and textual construct, plenty of space is opened for feminist perspectives.  At the same time, however, a new problem appears:  constructionism threatens to bracket the question of scientific objectivity.” (Lykke 79)

Amy Thomson, Virtual Girl


Part Two:  Alien m/others:  representing the feminine in science fiction film

Janes, Linda.  “Introduction to Part Two.” 91-100.

Constance Penley:  reinforcing link between technology and gendered subjectivity

Mary Ann Doane:  tension between potentially liberatory aspects of cyborg metaphor and tendency for its appropriation and use in manners that reinforce gender hierarchy

SF’s technophilia underpins an obsession with issues of reproduction and the maternal


Bundtzen, Lynda K.  “Monstrous Mothers:  Medusa, Grendel, and now Alien.” 101-109.

Aliens as “disturbing allegory” of contemporary feminism (Bundtzen 102)

Alien mama as “the phallic mother of nightmare” (Bundtzen 104)

Ripley as chosen, cultural maternal v. mama as biological-maternal

Ripley’s early fear of alien pregnancy:  “If this is the fear she wishes to defeat in her return — a fear of giving birth — coupled with a ferocious determination to protect Newt, and defending her twice from impregnation-implantation, then Aliens’ story pivots around a feminist guérillère doing battle with the premise that female anatomy is destiny.” (Bundtzen 106)

except that the opposition is the female principle — penultimate fight as “technological disembodiment of the maternal principle from the female body” (107); repugnance of female body


Doane, Mary Ann.  “Technophilia:  Technology, Representation, and the Feminine.”  110-121.

“when technology intersects with the body in the realm of representation, the question of sexual difference is inevitably involved” (Doane 110)

while tech makes possible the destabilizing of sexual identity, often it merely reifies conventional understandings

despite apparent emphasis on machine’s relationship with production, reproduction may be more crucial

Villiers de l’Isle-Adam, L’Eve future (1886) — Edison creates mechanical woman; needs maternal principle to animate here:  “the persistence of the maternal as a sub-theme accompanying these fantasies of artificial femininity” (Doane 112)

Metropolis:  mechanization of male workers’ bodies literalized in Maria — robot originally built as instrument of production, transformed into instrument of destruction via excessive and dangerous sexuality

opposition of robot (sexual) Maria and human (maternal) Maria

Stepford Wives:  banalization of machine-woman relationship

Blade Runner:  emphasis on vision and visuality; visual imaging machine; photographs as record of reality

“It is not surprising, then, that the genre that highlights technological fetishism — science fiction — should be obsessed with the issues of the maternal, reproduction, representation, and history.” (Doane 119)


Creed, Barbara.  “Alien and the Monstrous-Feminine.”  122-135.

reproduction of the Freudian primal scene in opening of film (Mother awakening crew), Kane’s penetration — coition as violent, monstrous

mother-goddesses; matriarchy; psychoanalytic readings of maternal

presence of the archaic mother in horror films; repeatedly staging a repudiation of the maternal


Sobchack, Vivian.  “Postfuturism.”  136-147.  (from Screening Space)

extraterrestrials are less “alien,” less Other than they were in the fifties; they are now our simulacra, “literally alienated images of our alienated selves” (Sobchack 137)

in conservative versions, “the ‘difference’ of the alien Other becomes absorbed in the homogeneity of a new universal ‘humanism’ ” (Sobchack 137); more postmodern and marginal versions suggest that the alien’s Otherness is not so much absorbed as diffused in postmodernism’s homogeneity

both are simultaneously progressive and regressive


Balsamo, Anne.  “Reading Cyborgs Writing Feminism.”  148-158.

“cyborgs fascinate us by technologically refashioning human difference.  It is in this sense that cyborgs disrupt notions of otherness.” (Balsamo 150)

though both male and female cyborg figures reproduce cultural gender stereotypes, argues that “female cyborg images do more to challenge the opposition between human and machine than do male cyborgs because femininity  is culturally imagined as less compatible with technology than is masculinity.  This is to say that because our cultural imagination aligns masculinity and rationality with technology and science, male gendered cyborgs fail to radically challenge the distinction between human and machine.  Female cyborgs, on the other hand, are culturally coded as emotional, sexual, and often, naturally maternal.  It is these very characteristics which more radically challenge the notion of an organic-mechanical hybrid.” (Balsamo 151)


Part Three:  Representing reproduction:  reproducing representation

Woodward, Kathryn.  “Introduction to Part Three.”  161-170.

reproductive technologies as illustration of the interrelationship between gender, technoscience, and representation

“Reproductive technologies offer a focus on motherhood and the mother-child relationship which includes the social and cultural relations which inform our understanding of motherhood:  of good and bad mothers, of who is allowed to be a mother and who is not, who is allowed to speak and who has the power to make decisions.” (Woodward 162)


Petchesky, Rosalind Pollack.  “Foetal Images:  The Power of Visual Culture in the Politics of Reproduction.”  171-192.

using of visual imagery in pro-life politics; “finding ‘positive’ images and symbols of abortion hard to imagine, feminists and other pro-choice activists have all too readily ceded the visual terrain.” (Petchesky 172)

The Silent Scream’s transformation of anti-abortion rhetoric from religious to technological mode

“Foetal imagery epitomizes the distortion inherent in all photographic images:  their tendency to slice up reality into tiny bits wrenched out of real space and time.” (Petchesky 175), in this case, slicing out the woman

link of photography to positivism, “that flawed epistemology that sees ‘reality’ as discrete bits of empirical data divorced from historical process or social relationships” (Petchesky 175) — drawing on Trachtenberg

Susan Sontag on link between photography and the state

obstetrical imaging as part of the expanding “management” of pregnancy, leading to an increasing medical view of fetal autonomy; “the pregnant woman is increasingly put in the position of adversary to her own pregnancy/foetus, either by having presented a ‘hostile environment’ to its development or by actively refusing some medically proposed intervention” (Petchesky 177)

relationship of ultrasound to military sonar technologies:  “Like penetrating Cuban territory with reconnaissance satellites and Radio Marti, treating a foetus as if it were outside a woman’s body, because it can be viewed, is apolitical act.” (Petchesky 177)

ultrasound as the “panoptics of the womb” (Petchesky 180)

pregnant women as viewers of foetal images: generally do not feel victimized, but rather elated at early connection with baby;  “How are we to understand this contradiction between the feminist decoding of male ‘cultural dreamworks’ and (some) women’s actual experience of reproductive techniques and images?” (Petchesky 182); women not the victims some would have them be

but:  “women may see in foetal images what they are told they ought to see.” (Petchesky 183)

conclusions:  need to restore women to “central place in the pregnancy scene,” (Petchesky 187) recontextualizing the fetus; need to “separate the power relations within which reproductive technologies…are applied from the technologies themselves” (Petchesky 187); need to pursue a “feminist ethic of reproductive freedom that complements feminist politics” (Petchesky 188)


Steinberg, Deborah Lynn.  “Feminist Approaches to Science, Medicine and Technology.” 193-208.

feminist empiricism (critiques of bad science) versus feminist standpoint theory (critiques of science-as-usual)

two volumes of essays on IVF, one from feminist empiricist perspective and one from feminist standpoint approach

argues for move toward “anti-oppressive feminist standpoint” position (Steinberg 197)


Farquhar, Dion.  “(M)Other Discourses.” 209-220.

a third path toward interrogating reproductive technologies that is neither liberal celebration nor fundamentalist (either feminist or religious) condemnation, nor is it inbetween

discussion of which groups get access to reproductive technologies; disruption of heterosexist assumptions about reproduction

shifting definitions of “mothering” (and “fathering”)

endorses a “more ambivalent agnostic postmodern position.  Instead of demonizing technology, vilifying consumption, and idealizing and edenic natural, it looks at the demographics of ART users — as well as those who cannot even qualify as users because of poverty or cultural isolation from technological medicine, etc. — and suggests transgressive social and political possibilities.” (Farquhar 216) — cyborgism


Haraway, Donna J.  “The Virtual Speculum in the New World Order.” 221-245.

“The global fetus and the spherical whole earth both exist because of, and inside of, technoscientific visual culture.  Yet, I think, both signify touch.  Both provoke yearning for the physical sensuousness of a wet and blue-green earth and a soft, fleshy child.  That is why these images are so ideologically powerful.  They signify the immediately natural and embodied, over and against the constructed and disembodied.” (Haraway 222)

the gendering of vision via Renaissance visual technologies

“Feminist technoscience inquiry is a speculum, a surgical instrument, a tool for widening the openings into all kinds of orifices to improve observation and intervention in the interest of projects that are simultaneously about freedom, justice, and knowledge.” (Haraway 235)


Part Four:  Refractions (women, technology and cyborgs)

Hovenden, Fiona.  “Introduction to Part Four.” 249-261.

readings about “the relationships between gender, race and technology, and … gendered lives in the production, proliferation, play and potential of computer-based technology” (Hovenden 250)


Irigaray, Luce.  “When Our Lips Speak Together.”  262-264.

not sure why this is here


Plant, Sadie.  “On the Matrix:  Cyberfeminist Simulations.” 265-275.

“Women are accessing the circuits on which they were once exchanged, hacking into security’s controls, and discovering their own post-humanity.” (Plant 265)

“This is the first discovery:  that patriarchy is not a construction, an order, or a structure, but an economy, for which women are the first and founding commodities.” (Plant 266)

“As media, tools, and good mutate, so the women begin to change, escaping their isolation and becoming increasingly interlinked.  Modern feminism is marked by the emergence of networks and contacts which need no centralized organization and evade its structures of command and control.” (Plant 267-68)

“Like women, any thinking machines are admitted on the understanding that they are duty-bound to honour and obey the members of the species to which they were enslaved:  the members, the males ones, the family of man.” (Plant 269)

early telephonists, operators, calculators, and computers were women; “only those at odds with this definition of humanity [the phallus] seem to be able to access this plane [the nonspace of the matrix]” (Plant 272)

“Those who still cherish the patriarchal dream see cyberspace as a new zone of hope for a humanity which wants to be freed from the natural trap, escaping the body and sliding into an infinite, transcendent, and perfect other world.  But the matrix is neither heaven, nor even a comforting return to the womb.” (Plant 273)


Adam, Alison.  “Feminist AI Projects and Cyberfutures.” 276-290.

feminist AI projects; AI and feminist legal theory; feminist computational linguistics; cyberculture and a meat-free existence

“I argue that the cyberpunk version of cyberculture, with its masculine attempts to transcend the ‘meat’, holds little obvious appeal for feminists.” (Adam 282)

use theoretical image of cyborg as alternative — cyberfeminism

Judith Squires argues, however, that “cyberfeminism, if indeed there is such a thing, is in danger of falling into the same trap with regard to the body as cyberculture in general, which promotes a particularly masculine connotation of the new continuity of mind and machine.” (Adam 284)


Wakeford, Nina.  “Gender and the Landscapes of Computing in an Internet Café.” 291-304.

contradictions in gendered subjectivities in internet study

landscapes of computing:  “the overlapping set of material and imaginary geographies which include, but are not restricted to, on-line experiences.” (Wakeford 292)

gendered metaphors of on-line landscapes:  frontier, street

gender experimentation in MUDs; gender-based harassment; cyberfeminism

must consider interconnections of embodiment and technological systems

question of embodiment returns us to metaphors of spatiality in computing, particularly the landscape


Hammonds, Evelynn M.  “New Technologies of Race.”  305-318.

“In the US race has always been dependent upon the visual.  I argue that the notion of race — both as a social and scientific concept — is still deeply embedded in morphology, but it is the meaning given to morphological differences that has been transformed.” (Hammonds 306)

“morphing” technologies reinscribe race as morphological difference

“Miscegenation then becomes an instance of border crossing between the human and the ‘other.’  This ‘other’ includes the non-human and also the more familiar ‘other,’ non-white humans.” (Hammonds 306)

DuBois and race-mixing:  “Miscegenation, and the bars against it, as DuBois rightfully identified, were about belief in a hierarchy of racial types which was explicitly used to deny the status of citizenship to all those who carried any evident physical signs of African heritage.” (Hammonds 307)

“the implicit norms governing morphing appear to forbid any monstrous combinations paralleling late nineteenth-century rhetoric against the progeny of interracial unions which claimed that such hybrid persons were unnatural.  With the Time cover we wind up not with a true composite, but a preferred or filtered composite of mixed figures with no discussion of the assumptions or implications underlying the choices.” (Hammonds 312)

“The simultaneous recognition of greater diversity, on the one hand, and morphological similarity, on the other, suggests a strange logic of equivalence.” (Hammonds 315)

“The history of white men crossing racial boundaries to have sexual relations with African, Asian, Mexican, and Native-American women — and then refusing to acknowledge their offspring in order to reserve the right to determine how whiteness would be defined as a characteristic of citizenship — is simultaneously implied and disavowed.  Race mixing in its newest form shapes our future not the past; bits and bytes replace the flesh and blood that provoked the guilt, hatred and violence of our country’s history of racial domination.  Hierarchies of domination have not disappeared as female reproduction is replaced by a masculine technophilic reproduction because stereotypical racial typologies remain in place.” (Hammonds 315-17)
