Novus Ordo Seclorum (25)

“You want to work out of Intramuros because it was systematically annihilated, and because you’re obsessed with the Holocaust” (Stephenson 24-25)

how to get into “fuck-you money”:  “pick a tech where no one can compete with us.  Right now, that=networking.  We’re kicking the crap out of everyone else in the world when it comes to networking.  It’s not even funny” (Stephenson 26)

Randy’s first trip to Manila, acknowledges that “He has gone from the place where things are consumed to where they are produced...” (Stephenson 55)

use of Charlene’s satirized poststructuralist discourse — the War as Text conference; the beards paper — to reveal Randy’s resistance to critique?

“‘I strenuously object to being labeled and pigeonholed and stereotyped as a technocrat,’ Randy said, deliberately using oppressed-person’s language, maybe in an attempt to turn their weapons against them but more likely (he thinks, lying in bed at three a.m. in the Manila Hotel) out of an uncontrollable urge to be a prick” (Stephenson 84).

of Avi:  “Perhaps he’s been reading some management guru who counsels young entrepreneurs to get deeply involved in a country’s culture” (Stephenson 90)

Avi chooses office location because of its “lines of sight” (Stephenson 94), including of Corregidor, where signal fires for Spanish galleons were lit

from Epiphyte’s promo video:  “In the old days, Corregidor’s position at the entrance of Manila Bay made it a natural lookout — a place where information about approaching ships could be gathered.... Today, Corregidor’s geographical situation makes it an ideal place to land deep-sea fiberoptic cables” (Stephenson 102-103)

internal military relations between officers and men (Stephenson 113)

description of Guadalcanal:  “a basically useless island in the Southwest Pacific where the Empire of Nippon and the United States of America are disputing — with rifles — each other’s right to build a military airbase” (Stephenson 163)

“We’re all so used to working in a purely abstract realm that it seems almost bizarre to go out into the real world and physically do something” (Stephenson 188) — maps in presentation reveal geopolitics of cyberspace

Sultinate of Kinakuta

function of data haven:  “Making the world safe for drug traffickers and Third-World kleptocrats” (Stephenson 253) — see interest of Harvard Li (Stephenson 313)

“physical location no longer matters in a digitized, networked world.  Cyberspace knows no boundaries. / Everyon nods vigorously except for, on the one hand, John Cantrell, and, on the other, the grizzled Chinese guys. / But hey, the Sultan continues, that’s just dizzy-headed cyber-cheerleading!  What bullshit!  Of course locations and boundaries matter! ... Goddamn it, does location matter in cybersapce or doesn’t it?  What’s the bottom line here?” (Stephenson 316-17).

“grizzled Chinese guys” are high-ranking PLA officers, including a general who’s head of “their investment arm” (Stephenson 383)

Pacific Islands colonized for info-processing purposes in WW2 (Stephenson 444)

“Since most hackers are white males, their companies are disaster areas when it comes to diversity, and it follows that all of the diversity must be concentrated in the one or two employees who are not hackers.  In the part of a federal equal-opportunity form where Randy would simply check a box labeled CAUCASIAN, Kia would have to attach multiple sheets on which her family tree would be ramified backwards through time ten or twelve generations until reaching ancestors who could actually be pegged to one specific ethnic group without glossing anything over, and those ethnic groups would be intimidatingly hip ones —  not Swedes, let’s say, but Lapps, and not Chinese but Hakka, and not Spanish but Basque.  Instead of doing this, on her job app for Epiphyte she simply checked “other and then wrote in TRANS-ETHNIC.  In fact, Kia is trans- just about every system of human categorization, and what is isn’t trans- she is post-.” (Stephenson 509)

the “message” being sent via the ten tons of gold in the Philippine jungle:  “That money is not worth having if you can’t spend it.  That certain people have a lot of money that they badly want to spend.  And that if we can give them a way to spend it, through the Crypt, that these people will be very happy, and conversely that if we screw up they will be very sad, and that whether they are happy or sad they will be eager to share these emotions with us, the shareholders and management team of Epiphyte Corp.” (Stephenson 528-29) — message derives from communication of geographical coordinates; relationship among geography, politics, and economics

“Current meatspace coordinates, hot from the GPS receiver card in my laptop” (Stephenson 529) — ties Randy into that geopolitical system
