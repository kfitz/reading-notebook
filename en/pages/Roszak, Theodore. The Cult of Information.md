Roszak, Theodore.  The Cult of Information:  A Neo-Luddite Treatise on High-Tech, Artificial Intelligence, and the True Art of Thinking.  2nd ed.  Berkeley:  U of California P, 1994.


Preface

“I approach this study with a healthy respect for the many helpful things computers can do, and not from a position of doctrinaire technophobia.  I do, however, want to suggest that the computer, like to too-susceptible emperor, has been overdressed in fabulous claims.  Further, I believe these claims have been deliberately propagated by elements in our society that are making some of the most morally questionable uses of computer power.” (Roszak xiii)

“my interest in these pages is not in the technology of computers, but in their folklore” (Roszak xiii)

talk about “information” (information age; information economy; etc): “These often-repeated catchphrases and clichés are the mumbo jumbo of a widespread public cult.... People who have no clear idea what they mean by information or why they should want so much of it are nonetheless prepared to believe that we live in an Information Age, which makes every computer around us what the relics of the True Cross were in the Age of Faith:  emblems of salvation.” (Roszak xiv)

“The burden of my argument is to insist that there is a vital distinction between what machines do when they process information and what minds do when they think.” (Roszak xv)

“Information technology has the obvious capacity to concentrate political power, to create new forms of social obfuscation and domination.  The less prepared we feel to question the uses to which it is put, the more certain we are to suffer those liabilities.” (Roszak xvi)
In Defense of the Naked Mind:  Introduction to the Second Edition

answering critiques that called the first ed. “Luddite” — both addressing the incorrect impressions about the original Luddites and aligning with their cause

“Whenever I hear vested interests like these speaking of information as if it were all the human mind needs to think with, I begin to feel as if I might have strayed into some strange sect where all about me I find people worshipping light bulbs.  No question but that light bulbs are useful devices; I would not want to live without them.  But I never would have thought of them as objects of veneration.” (Roszak xix-xx)

additional concern about computer/information worship that has developed since first edition:  the money machine (computerized trading and its effects on world financial markets as well as its resulting concentration of wealth and power in few hands)

“Granted, it is now possible for concerned citizens with PCs and Macs to log into electronic conferences on their local bulletin board, to debate, to gripe, to complain and petition.  On the other hand we have the money machine, which makes possible the electronic highjacking [sic] of the world’s financial markets by a small number of privileged traders who play the game for paper billions.” (Roszak xxxiii)

on role of computers in education:  “an increasing number of educators have begun to recognize that classroom technology is emphatically not neutral but carries with it significant (if subliminal) cultural, ethical, and epistemological presuppositions.  The computer is inherently a Cartesian device embedded in the assumptions of a single intellectual style within a single culture of the modern world.  The very metaphors that surround it bespeak a conception of the mind as logical machinery; the constant references to the ‘productivity’ that the computer promises endorse the values of the marketplace and the western ethos of progress.” (Roszak xxxiv-xxxv)

“the ideal of the online commonwealth” (Roszak xxxix)

“What I have seen and sampled among the new genres that Stewart Brand calls a ‘techno-feast of goodies’ can be dazzling in the extreme.  As one might predict, among all the goodies, an author would be most curious about the promise of the ‘electronic book.’  Will it inherit the future the way the printed book displaced the handwritten manuscript?” (Roszak xl)

“Whenever I find myself having doubts whether increasingly powerful media like these will ever be brought under the creative control of mature aesthetic minds, I try to remind myself that once upon a time the printing press, the camera, the piano, the orchestra, and motion pictures were innovations with no cultural track record.  But one thing I know for certain:  the minds that use these powers well will still have to master the art of thinking.”  (Roszak xlii)

“By now we should know what the Luddites of old learned before us:  every tool ever invented is a mixed blessing.  How things will balance out is a matter of vigilance, moral courage, and the distribution of power.” (Roszak xlvi)

1.  “Information, Please”

old sense of information:  “disjointed matters of fact that came in discrete little bundles” (Roszak 3)

“[information] was not regarded as something for which there was an insatiable public need” (Roszak 4)

nineteenth-century rise in administrative and governmental bureaucracy; social statistics reveal “the bureaucratization of life, the conversion of experience into numerical abstractions” (Roszak 4) — see literary representations of clerkdom, esp. Melville, “Bartleby the Scrivener”

rise of business machines:  “nobody would have seen them as anything more than ingenious sorting and counting contraptions, of about as much intellectual interest as the air brake or the dry cell battery.” (Roszak 5) — evidence:  those who used them were “low-level clerical help” (Roszak 5)

Elmer Rice, The Adding Machine (1923) — office machines and dehumanization

fundamental definition of a computer:  “a device that remembers what it counts, counts what it remembers, and retrieves whatever it has filed away at the touch of a button” (Roszak 6) — UNIVAC

“In times past, one would have thought of information as more of a lubricant that helped get commodities produced...  But these days information is freely called product, resources, capital, currency.” (Roszak 8)

cybernetics posed itself as the study not just of machines, but of life; Norbert Wiener’s The Human Use of Human Beings; saw feedback, “the ability of a machine to use the results of its own performance as self-regulating information and so to adjust itself as part of an ongoing process” (Roszak 9), as “an essential characteristic of mind and of life” (Roszak 9)

assumption of artificial intelligence (AI) research that mind and computer are both information processing systems

Wiener saw “information technology as a threat to short-term social stability, and possible as a permanent disaster” (Roszak 10); seeking in HUHB to hold cybernetics to ethical standards

Vonnegut’s Player Piano — “technocratic despotism” (Roszak 11)

Shannon’s “Mathematical Theory of Communication”; divorced “information” from meaning, making it “a purely quantitative measure of communicative exchanges” (Roszak 11), esp. those run through a mechanical channel

“information has come to denote whatever can be coded for transmission through a channel that connects a source with a receiver, regardless of semantic content” (Roszak 13)

result is blurring of intellectual distinctions, on the one hand, and successful rise of information technologies, on the other

“Achievements of this astonishing order were bound to shift our understanding of information away from people (as sources or receivers) toward the exciting new techniques of communication.” (Roszak 15-16)

“Thanks to the high success of information theory, we live in a time when the technology of human communications has advanced at blinding speed; but what people have to say to one another by way of that technology shows no comparable development.” (Roszak 16)

the new biology; DNA as “code” in Watson and Crick; transformation of human into cybernetic apparatus; terminology drawn from cybernetics

information “became the secret of life” (Roszak 18); people came to understand themselves as “bioocmputers”

rise of the “Age of Information”; “Information smacks of safe neutrality; it is the simply, helpful heaping up of unassailable facts.  In that innocent guise, it is the perfect starting point for a technocratic political agenda that wants as little exposure for its objectives as possible.” (Roszak 19)

2.  The Data Merchants

“high tech and the conservative opportunists” (Roszak 21); launching of the notion of the “information economy” by John Naisbitt’s Megatrends and Alvin Toffler’s The Third Wave

“Books like these belong to that immensely popular category of contemporary literature called futurology, an ungainly hybrid of potted social science, Sunday supplement journalism, and soothsaying.” (Roszak 21)

“Seemingly, there are no longer any fields to till, any ores to mine, any heavy industrial goods to manufacture; at most these continuing necessities of life are mentioned in passing and then lost in the sizzle of pure electronic energy somehow meeting all human needs painlessly and instantaneously.” (Roszak 22)

advertising-like writing in which “information” becomes synonymous with “knowledge” and knowledge becomes mass-producible; “Depth, originality, excellence, which have always been factors in the evaluation of knowledge, have somewhere been lost in the fast, futurological shuffle.” (Roszak 22)

“But if Naisbitt, Toffler, and company are meager of substance, they nevertheless brim with the sort of noncontroversial trendiness that easily catches on among business types and public officials in search of attractively packaged convenience food for thought.” (Roszak 23)

connections of such futurology to the neoconservatives via Newt Gingrich, circa 1984

information economy imagined to be “manifest industrial destiny” (Roszak 26) but in fact the result of a series of choices that have linked high-tech to the militarization of the economy

in info economy, corporations move manufacturing abroad, freeing themselves from unionized labor

“It is becoming notorious that the new microchip plants, as dazzling as their work may sound to the world beyond the factory walls, come close to being sweatshop operations for the low skilled, mainly female work force they employ.” (Roszak 28)

“assembly-line high tech has proven to be highly exportable; it is easily relocated to Asia or Latin America, where the work force is usually younger and more female, meaning cheaper and more docile.” (Roszak 29)

futurologists miss the fact that high tech is an outgrowth of industrial economy, not a replacement

hype surrounding future possibilities of computer technologies fed by desire for info economy; marketplace optimism feeds on and produces more hype

“One shudders to believe that there can really be an audience that takes fatuous and infantile applications of the computer like these seriously.” (Roszak 36)

predictions by “hackers and hucksters” that computers “will one day be smarter than people” (Roszak 36); “Behind this line of thought there lies a long, steady process of anthropomorphizing the computer as a surrogate human intelligence.” (Roszak 36) — computer storage = memory; data processing = thinking

western techno history focused on development of strong machines and smart machines; smart machines receive more respect:  “They have a seductive appeal to the scientific imagination, which has freely borrowed them as models of the universe at large, often reshaping our experience of the world to make it fit that model.” (Roszak 40)

Karl Capek’s R.U.R.; “This image of the humanoid machine has given rise to a line of thought that is now well represented among the computer enthusiasts as the ultimate expression of mechanistic supremacy.  The computer has received an evolutionary interpretation which marks it out for a spectacular destiny.  It may survive its maker and become the dominant species of ‘life’ on earth.” (Roszak 41)

predictions of evolution of new computer-human hybrid

“If thinking is simply a matter of information processing, then indeed there is no significant distinction to be made between the way human beings think and machine think, except to recognize that machines are better at the task.... It is a grim vision of life that assumes we must timidly become the victims of the culture we have created.” (Roszak 43)

biologists borrowed from cyberneticists in describing DNA as “code”; computer scientists borrow from biologists in describing technology:  “Culture is like that; it often grows by metaphorical elaboration, one field of thought borrowing from another for suggestive images.  But at a certain point, metaphorical elaboration becomes plain bad thinking.  That point is where the metaphors stop being suggestive and are taken literally.” (Roszak 44) — such thinking is rife in the “folklore of computers” (Roszak 44)

technophilia; “the computer does so ingeniously mimic human intelligence that it may significantly shake our confidence in the uses of the mind.  And it is the mind that must think about all things, including the computer.” (Roszak 45)

3.  The Hidden Curriculum

influx of computers into classrooms, but not evenly distributed (heavily weighted toward wealthy school districts), and mostly driven by computer-age advertising hype, with little substance to back it up

“computer literacy” as catchphrase — but what is it?  Teaching programming?  This does demystify the computer a bit, but how useful is it?  “The fact is, each new generation of computers requires fewer special skills, requiring less ‘literacy’ of users, in much the same way that advances in automotive engineering have made driving a car easier.” (Roszak 50)

“Some states... have spent generously to train their teachers in various computer skills, but that does no good when there is no clear idea as to whether the schools are to tech about computers, or through computers, or by way of computers.” (Roszak 50)

“Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT once described the computer as ‘a solution in search of problems.’  There could be no better example of this than the way elementary and high schools are dealing with the machine.” (Roszak 51)

“For computer scientists, it is no doubt exciting to ask:  ‘Can we invent a machine that does what a teacher does?’  But there is another questions one might ask:  ‘Why should we want to invent a machine to do that in the first place?’  There was never any difficulty in answering that question where the machine was intended to take over work that was dirty, dangerous, or back-breaking.  Teaching is hardly any of these.  Indeed, it would seem to be one of those ‘human uses of human beings’ to which people might expect to turn when the robots have ‘saved’ their labor on the assembly lines. /  There is no way around the fact that the computer makers have a vested interest in the technological unemployment of willing and available teachers.” (Roszak 54)

“Computerized instruction may become for the campus what automation has become for the assembly line:  the royal road to down-sizing.” (Roszak 59)

describes distance-ed, and accurately predicts its ideological purposes and its shortcomings — in 1984

“if the computer makers succeed in their hard sell, we may soon be graduating students who believe (with their teachers’ encouragement) that thinking is indeed a matter of information processing, and therefore without a computer no thinking can be done at all.” (Roszak 60-61)

extols the virtues of face-to-face, mind-to-mind teaching:  “Too much apparatus, like too much bureaucracy, only inhibits the natural flow.  Free human dialogue, wandering wherever the agility of the mind allows, lies at the heart of education.  If teachers do not have the time, the incentive, or the wit to provide that, if students are too demoralized, bored, or distracted to muster the attention their teachers need of them, then that is the educational problem which has to be solved — and solved from inside the experience of the teachers and the students.  Defaulting to the computer is not a solution; it is surrender.” (Roszak 63)

hackers’ obsessions with the computer reveal that “[t]he relationship of the human being to the machine is, thus, an ambivalent one, a complex mixture of sensed inferiority and the need to dominate, of dependence and mastery.” (Roszak 66)

dangers of simulation, “especially for children” (Roszak 68) — models begin to seem like a better reality; computerized “experiments” eliminate the rough edges of reality

4.  The Program Within the Program

Logo and its relationship to the computer in the schools; teaches students to think procedurally, and diverts them from creativity

“linguistic absurdity” of learning poetry through Logo — “Language, by virtue of its metaphorically playful origins, simply does not fall into such categories....  It is precisely this problem of connecting words to well-defined contexts that govern their meaning which has made machine translation so nearly impossible.  Behind the problem lies the interesting speculation that language, with whose fluidity and unruliness programmers have such difficulties, arises from the poetic endowment of the mind and continues to bear the stamp of its origin.” (Roszak 79-80)
