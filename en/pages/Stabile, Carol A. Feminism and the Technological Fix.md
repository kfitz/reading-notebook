Stabile, Carol A.  Feminism and the Technological Fix.  Manchester, UK:  Manchester University Press, 1994.

Introduction.  Selling futures:  feminism and the technological fix

“enduring pervasiveness of the woman/nature, man/culture binarism in the United States and its implications for feminist approaches to technology and modernity” (Stabile 1)

as definitions of femaleness shift in response to developing technologies (especially reproductive and genetic technologies), feminists cluster around two positions:  technophobia and technomania

class as absent category of analysis

connected to conservative retrenchment of 1980s and 90s (irony of “new world order” based on “traditional” American values); tapped into anxieties about technology

left and right agree that the world has been changed by technology; no agreement on what changes are or what they mean

left once saw technology as progressive; post-Hiroshima and Vietnam, not so much

feminism long pro-organic, anti-tech

technological determinism of 70s gave way to fragmented, deterritorialized subjectivities

technomania of Baudrillard, Lyotard, et al, “often leads them to endorse transformations that recentralize a privileged male subjectivity in which, as Alice Jardine observes, ‘Man is always the subject of any becoming, even if “he” is a woman’.” (Stabile 4)

masculinist technomania operates without reference to the ways technology actually operates on human bodies, especially marked bodies — but feminist alternative is similarly dematerialized, in its technophobia

attempting to bridge the gap, work analyzing technoscience’s inscription of the bodies of female or feminized subjects:  Evelyn Fox Keller; Sandra Harding; Helen Longino — but still spends more time lamenting technoculture than creating alternatives

Haraway:  more radical shift, but too much a fan of Baudrillard (?)

Stabile is seeking “a better understanding of the complex and often antagonistic relationship between feminist theory and activism and the conditions that structure the modern, technological world.  I do this not by making a direct reading of the relationship between technologies and feminisms, but by an interstitial approach to the problematic.” (Stabile 6)

socialist analysis, combining anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobic feminism with historical-materialist analysis

“The problems confronting women today require that feminists be able to analyze oppression conjuncturally — to think, in other words, not of the mythic origins of some original and primary oppression, but rather of the multiply determined forms of oppression that constitute ‘women’ (as well as ‘men’) within the context of capitalism.” (Stabile 12)

new identity-based social movements are positive, in sense of providing basis for coalitions and in fighting vagaries of Foucauldian, unlocalizable power with local action; however, “in so resolutely avoiding ‘totalizing’ — that bête noire of contemporary critical theory — this model either ignores or jettisons a structural analysis of capitalism in which the new social movements might be read as yet another example of the disillusion and dissolution that have plagued progressive political formations in the US.” (Stabile 13)

John Clarke:  postmodern social theory characterized by adoption of systemic or cybernetic models

“In order to unpack the connections between the postmodernist debates and feminist theory, my argument proceeds by way of two dominant feminist responses to the present, technophobia and technomania.  If feminist technophobia and technomania are, respectively, negative and positive response to the concept of postmodernity, rather than being merely abstractions, the questions feminists pose about the status of history and contemporary society in the field of literature can serve as an index to the material interests that motivate such inquiries.” (Stabile 15)

sneers at the “radical democracy” of Laclau & Mouffe and Angela McRobbie (“ignorant”!)

oppositions between feminism and postmodernism  centered on pm’s refusal of grand narratives (just as feminists developed a narrative of their own) as well as pm’s “insistence on the unknowability of the social, [which] directly contradicts feminist epistemological grounding in experience” (Stabile 19)

in both, however, intellectual (not worker) is agent of social change

1.  Recycled histories

“privileged interpretive position” of speculative fiction within theories of the postmodern

slippage between discourse and reality allows the “realism” of speculative fiction to be considered as a “hyperrealism” — a mimetic representation of a reality that does not yet exist, but might

present as historical moment viewed from the future; result:  “the material and ideological conditions of the present are consigned to the past” (Stabile 27)

in technophobic feminist sci-fi, sense of time is reversed:  “the future is constructed out of remembrances of an alternative history” (Stabile 27); present nonetheless dematerialized as an “effect of either the past or the future” (Stabile 27)

“technophobic feminisms believe that the recuperation and restoration of women’s history and literature can provide paradigms for feminist futurologies.  History and historical inquiries are not a problem; the problem lies in the fact that the only history on offer is that of ‘man,’ of (masculinist) literary history.” (Stabile 28)

feminist recuperative literary history assumes the relative autonomy of women’s writing in relationship to patriarchal culture; allows for an essentializing of women’s writing and the ideological isolation of the feminist project and an absence of critical self-reflexivity

critical reception of Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland, republished in 1979, reveals essentializing trend; celebration of pro-natalist feminist position, ignoring ideological problems of novel (including draining away of erotic desire, overt racism, heterosexism, etc)

eugenicist ideology ignored in its feminist manifestations (see Gilman, Margaret Sanger, etc.) and assigned to patriarchy’s response to birth control instead

“The point at stake here has little to do with asking Gilman to deliver the impossible — to have written a different, anti-racist text, for example.  Instead, it involves confronting a history of racism, elitism, and homophobia in which women — some of whom called themselves feminists — participated, in addition to confronting the racism, classism, and homophobia that exist in the present.” (Stabile 35)

Suzette Hayden Elgin’s Native Tongue similarly essentializes gender and erases race, class, and sexuality from analysis; “In Native Tongue, the possibility of utopia depends on a disengagement with technology and phallocentrism and a return to a more natural female culture.  And such a disengagement depends, of course, upon the rediscovery of women’s natural ties with nature.” (Stabile 39)

“Technophobia’s antipathy toward the futurologies proposed by postmodernism can be summed up as a rejection of the present and the future in favor of a return to the primal origins of the woman/nature link.” (Stabile 39)

Octavia Butler, and the “impossibility of improved worlds” (Stabile 40); “Butler’s texts are neither utopian nor dystopian, because what is at stake is not a better or worse social order, but the biological imperative to survive” (Stabile 40); Butler’s characters are neither free to choose nor wholly forced, but are instead persuaded to submit by “a complicated process of dominance, persuasion, and coercion” (Stabile 42); forms of domination always somehow exceed forms of human domination

“Butler’s work, in short, represents worlds where — as in the postmodern — critical consciousness co-exists with certain pleasures that make an otherwise unbearable world infinitely bearable.” (Stabile 43) — and is thus ultimately complicit? (capitalism as imperfect but best possible system?)

“Technophobia and technomania share the postmodern critique of Enlightenment values.  The essentialism that undergirds technophobic feminism views the Enlightenment project as unredeemably phallocentric.  In place of an originary narrative that situates the universal (hu)man subject at the center of the universe, feminist technophobia looks backward to a matriarchy untainted by masculinist, Enlightenment values for its version of an ideal society, although it implicitly subscribes to many other Enlightenment values...” (Stabile 45)

2.  ‘A garden inclosed is my sister’: ecofeminism and eco-valences

relationship between technophobic feminist literary theory and the wider sphere of political activity and economic production and reproduction; analysis of the consequences of the “myopia” of technophobic thought beginning from ecofeminism

“technophobia’s endorsement of naturalized connections between women and nature itself emerges from a privileged environment” (Stabile 49)

need for self-reflexive criticism around environmental issues in the US; lack of connection between environmentalism and issues of race and class

“Environmentalists and ecofeminists in the US are only now beginning to confront the fact that their constituencies are more often than not composed of white, middle-class people and the environments with which they are concerned.” (Stabile 50)

political limitations of technophobia’s focus on the woman/nature connection; pointing toward “a feminist and socialist environmentalism that is committed to a global understanding and formulation of the concept of an ecosystem and its social relations — one that is cognizant of, and attentive to, the complexities of that term.” (Stabile 50)

Janet Biehl, Rethinking Ecofeminist Politics:  “how ecofeminist reliances upon the naturalized connection between ‘woman’ and ‘nature’ reify dominant ideologies of female nature” (Stabile 51)

founding ecofeminists like Mary Daly and Susan Griffin call for rejection of technology and alignment with nature; both analytically and politically suspect

technophobic authorization of woman/nature connection has repeatedly been used to serve the interests of conservative politics

“The general association of environmental concerns with leisure-time activities is thus legitimated through a representational framework that rigidly distinguishes between a pre-industrial, romanticized environment and industrialized non-environments inhabited on an everyday basis.” (Stabile 58)

“An appropriation of Native American cultures that ignores or does not engage with the material conditions of those communities decontextualizes at the same time that it reveals the class and race specificity of its proponents.” (Stabile 58-59)

ecofeminism’s emphasis on appropriate consumption ignores role of overconsumption in environmental degradation; also ignores class-based nature of consumption; “environmentalism has been transformed into an intrinsic part of bourgeois culture” (Stabile 62)

3.  Shooting the mother:  fetal photography and the politics of disappearance

question asked by Stabile’s interrogation:  “If this text or strategy takes an essentialist approach, how is it, or can it be, deployed by anti-feminist forces?  Or, more to the point, how can re-contextualizations and de-contextualizations serve the interests of conservative politics?” (Stabile 69)

project of disarticulation of woman and mother:  “I do not want to reduce a complicated combination of historical and political circumstances to the results of technological advances, i.e. fetal visualization and technology, but I do want to analyze how visual technologies, in a society dependent upon images, have played an important role in erasing women’s bodies.” (Stabile 70)

the disappearance of the maternal space; emergence of “an environment that the fetus alone occupies” (Stabile 71)

“In light of the contemporary situation, a technophobic pro-natalism that consecrates maternal values cannot formulate sufficiently comprehensive or coherent analyses to counter this problematic reinscription of paternal authority.... On the other hand, a technomanic position that advocates ‘dispensing with the body as the necessary and sufficient criterion for personhood’ appears to participate in the larger project in which women are excluded altogether from enjoying legal rights because of the looming, newly emergent legal subject par excellence — the fetus.” (Stabile 92-93, quoting Mary Poovey, “The Abortion Question and the Death of Man”)

“Haraway repeatedly invokes the cyborg subject position as one in which previously patrolled and policed boundaries and borders have been broken down by the ‘inexorable’ march of science and technology.” (Stabile 93)

4.  Semper fidelis:  daughters in their fathers’ military

Thelma & Louise-inspired debate on women and violence:  have they become men?

coincident with Desert Storm: images of women in battle; problematic for both technophobic and technophilic feminists:  “For technophobic feminists, with their investment in women’s nurturing and pacifistic nature, women’s active participation in the armed forces rocks with foundationalist belief in an essential female nature....  For technophilic feminists and their adherence to liberal reformism, the call for equal opportunity within the military negates critiques of militarism and imperialism” (Stabile 101)

gendering of traditional protection scenario:  female or feminized victim, masculine protector — violated by women in military, who cannot be both victim and protector

protection scenario also violated by military’s treatment of its own women (as well as gays and lesbians)

5.  Calculating on a frictionless plane

“In many ways and places, technophobia remains the dominant paradigm for feminist futurologies in Western culture.” (Stabile 134)

“Feminist technomania, mainly expressed through feminist postmodernist theories, so far remains a phenomenon limited to intellectual circles.” (Stabile 135) — provides an alternative by deconstructing connection of woman/nature, but questions that must be used to interrogate technomania are much the same as those for technophobia

Haraway and the cyborg: not “blithely technomanic,” but nonetheless circulating “within the boundaries of a particular postmodern hyperspace” (Stabile 136)

reads Haraway’s work as “representative of an expanding trend within feminist theory that dismisses an understanding of the complicated workings of structurally orchestrated, material oppressions in favor of endless, and endlessly revolving, metaphoric oppressions” (Stabile 137)

“Essentially, Haraway’s advocacy of avant-garde practices narrows and isolates political struggle to a form of discursive engagement specific to intellectuals.” (Stabile 146)

“If feminism is to have a political and politicized future, it must progress beyond either a technophobic political model based on identity or the technomanic model of affinity.” (Stabile 155) — affinity not an acceptable alternative to identity because affinity almost never moves outside class boundaries
