Preface

SIGGRAPH 2001 moment:  animation show revealing how images were created; scene from Shrek that quotes The Matrix — “the ‘camera’ backs away, revealing a movie set as it might have appeared in the shooting of The Matrix, with cameras positioned around a circular stage so the footage can be spliced together to give a 360-degree view.  The stage set reminds us that rotating Neo’s image requires many cameras when shooting film, but can be done effortlessly with a computer program simply by rotating the perspective....  In this dizzying procession of images, a simulation (the Princess) has been converted to a representation (the Princess being filmed by cameras) and re-converted back to a simulation (wire-framing the cameras) — all within a matter of a few seconds” (Hayles 4-5)

Bolter & Grusin, “remediation”; medial ecology

relationship between representation and simulation in the Shrek example suggests a revision of Baudrillard’s precession of simulacra;  “the cycling back and forth between representation and simulation in the SIGGRAPH Shrek clip suggests that we are not so much racing toward a final implosion as participating in an ecology in which one medium is remediated in another, only to be remediated in turn.” (Hayles 5-6)

continuing importance of materiality:  “The engineers who design these machines, the factory workers who build them, the software designers who write programs for them, and the technicians who install and maintain them have no illusions that physical reality has faded away.” (Hayles 6)

“This book is an experiment in forging a vocabulary and set of critical practices responsive to the full spectrum of signifying components in print and electronic texts by grounding them in the materiality of the literary artifact.” (Hayles 6)

“The different media in which these works are instantiated provide the occasion for Media-Specific Analysis, a mode of critical interrogation alert to the ways in which the medium constructs the work and the work constructs the medium.” (Hayles 6)

“I saw in electronic literature the opportunity to think more rigorously about interactions between content and digital environments; I also believed these insights could be reflected back onto print to see it more clearly as well.” (Hayles 7)

Chapter 1.  Media and Materiality

creative works, theories, and practices is both about artifacts and about individuals

this book as “exploring what the print book can be in the digital age” (Hayles 9)

role of autobiography in book:  “Insofar as my life experiences can be of interest to anyone outside my immediate family and friends, it is because they are characteristic of the transition generation raised and formed by print but increasingly molded by electronic environments.” (Hayles 10)

creation of fictional autobiographical persona — Kaye

“Mediation came to her most vividly, then, not through the television her apartment did not have, or the newspapers she had no time to read, or the movies she could not afford on her frugal budget, but in the chemistry laboratory.  If only she could peer at the molecules and see exactly what they were, how they moved and coupled with one another, how they arranged themselves in space and time as the reactions proceeded!  The desire to see them was so intense she dreamed about it, sure that misconceptions and hazy notions would be dispelled if she could only encounter them directly.  She reminded herself sternly that this was science, not fiction, and the only way she could get at them was through the layers of mediation created by the laboratory equipment and procedures.” (Hayles 13)

on the parochialism of the ivy-league institution:  “It was a kind of parochialism new to her, consisting of making finer and finer discriminations until most of the rest of the world was excluded, including public universities, technical institutions, regional colleges and all the zesty, unpredictable things happening in them, but she had no trouble in recognizing it as parochialism nevertheless.” (Hayles 15)

on entry into electronic literature:  “The challenge, she understood even at this early moment, would be to bring together the binaries that had somehow always been important to her life:  media and materiality; science and literature; immersion in an imaginative realm and delight in the physical world; the strict requirements for precisely written code and the richness of natural language; underlying regularities and the free-form of creative play.” (Hayles 15-16)

Chapter 2.  Material Metaphors, Technotexts, and Media-Specific Analysis

“within the humanities and especially in literary studies, there has traditionally been a sharp line between representation and the technologies producing them.” (Hayles 19)

“A few theorists attentive to these developments [incl. artists books and concrete poetry] have argued eloquently for the importance of the book as a physical object and for criticism as material practice.” (Hayles 19)

importance of materiality to literary study:  “without it we have little hope of forging a robust and nuanced account of how literature is changing under the impact of information technologies.” (Hayles 19)

combating the “print-centric view” that simply including images into our consideration of text is enough

“What would it mean to talk about materiality in an era in which simulations are everywhere around us?” (Hayles 21)

“material metaphor” — new type of metaphor that does not simply connect symbols and ideas, but instead symbols and material apparatuses; term “foregrounds the traffic between words and physical artifacts” (Hayles 22)

book as material metaphor:  “an artifact whose physical properties and historical usages structure our interactions with it in ways obvious and subtle.” (Hayles 22)

“To change the physical form of the artifact is not merely to change the act of reading (although that too has consequences the importance of which we are only beginning to recognize) but profoundly to transform the metaphoric network structuring the relation of word to word.” (Hayles 23)

“To change the material artifact is to transform the context and circumstances for interacting with the words, which inevitably changes the meanings of the words as well.  This transformation of meaning is especially potent which the words reflexively interact with the inscription technologies that produce them.” (Hayles 23-24)

“To count as an inscription technology, a device must initiate material changes that can be read as marks.” (Hayles 24)

technotexts:  “When a literary work interrogates the inscription technology that produces it, it mobilizes reflexive loops between its imaginative world and the material apparatus embodying that creation as a physical presence.  Not all literary works make this move, of course, but even for those that do not, my claim is that the physical form of the literary artifact always affects what the words (and other semiotic components) mean.  Literary works that strengthen, foreground, and thematize the connections between themselves as material artifacts and the imaginative realm of verbal/semiotic signifiers they instantiate open a window on the larger connections that unite literature as a verbal art to its material forms.” (Hayles 25)

“writing machines” plays with multiple connections of writing and materiality; both referencing inscription technologies and the act of representing or referencing those technologies

all technotexts she discusses could also be called hypertexts; three major characteristics of hypertext:  multiple reading paths, chunked text, linking mechanism

early hypertext theorists and authors emphasized the link; “Although this structure departs from print in providing multiple reading paths, it preserves the basic print convention of moving through a text by going from one page/screen to another.  In retrospect the revolutionary claims made for these early hypertexts appear inflated, for they were only beginning to tap into the extraordinary resources offered by electronic environments.” (Hayles 27)

second generation electronic literature:  see Aarseth, Cybertext — argues for “a perspective fundamentally computational in nature” (Hayles 27)

“Hypertext connotes an emphasis on links, a brand of criticism derived from traditional literary approaches, and a polemic that seeks to convince the literary community of the value and importance of electronic hypertext for pedagogy, criticism, and theory.  Cybertext connotes a functional and semiotic approach that emphasizes a computational perspective, a polemic that wants, as Stuart Moulthrop put it (echoing James Joyce) to ‘kill the literary priest,’ and an emphasis on computer games as paradigmatic examples of ergodic texts, which Aarseth defines as those literary systems that require ‘nontrivial effort’ to allow the reader to traverse them.  To use one term or the other is not only to invoke a particular approach but to position oneself in a highly contested field where allies and enemies sometimes count more than arguments.” (Hayles 28)

media-specific analysis:  material criticism that “pays attention to the material apparatus producing the literary work as physical artifact” (Hayles 29)

Barthes’ “From Work to Text”:  “uncannily anticipated electronic hypertext by associating text with dispersion, multiple authorship, and rhizomatic structure.... Useful as the vocabulary of text was in expanding textuality beyond the printed page, it also had the effect, in treating everything from fashion to fascism as a semiotic system, of eliding differences in materiality.” (Hayles 30)

MSA is not to suggest that media can or should be considered in isolation from one another

“MSA moves from the language of text to a more precise vocabulary of screen and page, digital program and analogue interface, code and ink, mutable image and durable mark, computer and book.” (Hayles 30-31)

“In attending to the materiality of the medium, MSA explicitly refutes the concept of the literary work that emerged from eighteenth-century debates over copyright” (Hayles 31) which suggest that the literary work is “content,” not “form”

“MSA aims to electrify the neocortext of literary criticism into recognizing that strands traditionally emphasizing materiality (such as criticism on the illuminated manuscript, on writers such as William Blake and Emily Dickinson, where embodiment is everything, and on the rich tradition of artists’ books) are not exceptions but instances of MSA.  Like all literature, technotext has a body (or rather many bodies), and the rich connections between its material properties and its content create it as a literary work in the full sense of the term.” (Hayles 32)

“An emergent property, materiality depends on how the work mobilizes its resources as a physical artifact as well as on the user’s interactions with the work and the interpretive strategies she develops — strategies that include physical manipulations as well as conceptual frameworks.” (Hayles 33)

not arguing for the end of books; rather for digital media as providing “the chance to see print with new eyes, and with it, the possibility of understanding how deeply literary theory and criticism have been imbued with assumptions specific to print.” (Hayles 33)

Chapter 3.  Entering the Electronic Environment

“autobiographical” narrative of coming to understand electronic literature via MSA

first read hypertext as if it were print on screen; “Despite the hoopla, first-generation works left mostly untouched the unconscious assumptions that readers of books had absorbed through centuries of print.” (Hayles 37)

Patchwork Girl as herald of second-generation electronic literature; drew connections between electronic text and fragmented body; “Navigation was envisioned as taking place not only between lexias but between images and words, and more profoundly between the text and the computer producing it.” (Hayles 38)

Aarseth:  “textual functions must not only be based on the marks appearing on screen but also had to take into account what was happening inside the machinery.  To distinguish between screen display and underlying code, he coined the terms scripton and texton.  Here was a perspective and vocabulary that reinterpreted the print book in terms of the computer, rather than shoe-horning electronic texts into categories derived from print.” (Hayles 40)

encounters with M.D. Coverley’s Califia and Diana Slattery’s Glide

paper delivered at romanticist conference:  “In her conclusion she drew the obvious moral that the literary community could no longer afford to treat text on screen as if it were print read in a vertical position.  Electronic text had its own specificities, and a deep understanding of them would bring into view by contrast the specificities of print, which could again be seen for what it was, a medium and not a transparent interface.” (Hayles 43)

Joyce and Coover abandoning electronic literature:  sense of writer’s voice being overwhelmed by technology; other, “more general concerns that worried her about electronic literature — problems of access, obsolescence, and software compatibility, not to mention the fact it was a pricey enterprise for writers, and very few if any were making money from it.” (Hayles 45)

however:  “Even if electronic literature crashed and burned, which she considered highly unlikely, literary studies could no longer pretend that electronic textuality was print on a screen.  The desktop computer changed things forever.” (Hayles 45)

Chapter 4.  Electronic Literature as Technotext:  Lexia to Perplexia

digital computer as “simulation engine”: “Computers are much more than hardware and software.  In their general form, computers are simulation machines producing environments, from objects that sit on desktops to networks spanning the globe....  When the simulated environment takes literary and narrative form, potent possibilities arise for reflexive loops that present the user with an imaginative fictional world while simultaneously engaging her with a range of sensory inputs that structure bodily interactions to reinforce, resist, or otherwise interact with the cognitive creation of the imagined world.” (Hayles 48)

in Memmott, “the artificiality of the environment is foregrounded to suggest that subjects are themselves simulations operating according to the dynamics and protocols of the medium through which they are constituted.  To the extent that the user enters the imaginative world of this environment and is structured by her interactions with it, she also becomes a simulation, an informational pattern circulating through the global network that counts as the computational version of human community.” (Hayles 49)

“less a narrative than a set of interrelated speculations about the future (and past) of human-intelligent machine interactions, along with extensive reinscriptions of human subjectivity and the human body.” (Hayles 49) — “cyborganization”

creole formed of English and computer code; “The creole is formed as code erupts through the surface of the screenic text, infecting English with machine instructions and machine instructions with English, as if the distinction between natural and programming language has broken down and the two scripts are mingling promiscuously inside the computer.” (Hayles 50)

moments of illegibility; “not simply a lack of meaning, then, but a signifier of distributed cognitive processes that construct reading as an active production of a cybernetic circuit and not merely an internal activity of the human mind.” (Hayles 51)

“Lexia to Perplexia is a very ‘nervous’ document.  It constantly acts/reacts in ways that remind the user she is not in control...” (Hayles 57)

“The linking structure works not by moving the reader from lexia to lexia — the standard form used by first-generation literary hypertexts such as Afternoon — but rather through a combination of user and computer actions that nervously jump from one screen layer to another, as if probing the multiple layers of code used to produce these effects.” (Hayles 58)

text “implies that at some point (or many points) our flesh will circulate through the cybernetic circuit, miniaturized so that it can slip through the ‘mouth of the funnel’ and merge with other subjectivities into a collective ‘we.’ / This is at least the ideology of the text, but the actuality of its materialization is more complex.  At the same time the work appears to banish the flesh, it also relies on embodiment for its digital performance.” (Hayles 61)

“the work anticipates its own inevitable future when the platform on which it runs is obsolete, and it can no longer be opened.  The work at this point will cease to exist...  The work can no more escape its body than its human interlocutors can escape theirs.” (Hayles 62)

“what is clearly established is not the superiority of code to flesh but metaphoric networks that map electronic writing onto fluid bodies.” (Hayles 63)

Chapter 5.  Experiencing Artists’ Books

introduced to artists’ books; went to MOMA to study them

Visual Studies Workshop at Rochester — printing facilities and bookstore

“many of the artists’ books coming out of the Workshop were more interesting visually than verbally.  She speculated this was so because many of the artists tended to locate metaphoric intensity and play in images rather than words.... the prose was often rather flat because it was seen as an explanation or amplification of the images.  The insight struck home for Kaye, because she recognized that its inverse often held for literary scholars...” (Hayles 70)

study at the Getty – “book-like objects” Hayles (71)

artists’ books raise for her objections to Vannevar Bush’s “As We May Think,” which argues that Memex works through association, like the mind; “What Bush’s formulation neglects, she thought, is the feedback loop from materiality to mind.  Obviously artifacts spring from thought, but thought also emerges from interactions with artifacts.” (Hayles 75)

“If books are seen only as immaterial verbal constructs, the rich potential of this interplay is lost.  Literary critics have long accepted that form is content and content is form.  Now Kay wanted to shout, ‘Materiality is content, and content is materiality!’” (Hayles 75)

Chapter 6.  A Humument as Technotext:  Layered Topographies

Tom Phillips; chooses A Human Document for his project by chance, but:  “Through curious serendipity, his treatment of Mallock’s text reinscribes Mallock’s own strategies; Mallock in his ‘Introduction’ creates a person who agrees to edit a scrapbook of journals, letters, and memorabilia of two recently deceased lovers.  These documents are hypertextual, for though ‘some single thread of narrative, in a feminine handwriting, ran through the whole volume,’ this was ‘broken by pages of letters, by scraps of poetry, and various other documents’ in a masculine hand (Mallock, p. 4).  The editor believes that this profusion of materials disqualifies the scrapbook from being a novel.  Uncannily anticipating contemporary discussions of hypertext narrative, he asserts that ‘as they stand they are not a story in any literary sense; though they enable us, or rather force us, to construct one out of them for ourselves’ (p. 8).” (Hayles 78)

scenes of writing throughout the novel

double impulse in the novel:  on the one hand, reveals “precursor texts that embody a hypertextual proliferation of narratives... On the other hand, the novel’s project is to suppress this unruly complexity, smoothing many conflicting paths into one coherent narrative.” (Hayles 79)

“In ‘treating’ Mallock’s novel, Phillips creates an artist’s book that seeks to bring into view again this suppressed hypertextual profusion.” (Hayles 80)

treats Mallock’s text as “an inexhaustible hypertext, only some of whose possibilities he can actualize in his inscription of narrative pathways, which themselves offer multiple hypertextual readings” (Hayles 88)

“In A Humument, the page is never allowed to disappear by serving only as the portal to an imagined world as it does with realistic fiction.  In many ways and on many levels, A Humument insists on its materiality.” (Hayles 96)

“Complementing these flexible movements between verbal construction and artifactual physicality is the configuration of the page as an interface that implicitly constructs the reader through its materiality.  As the two-dimensional page is visually stretched into something like three dimensions, a topographic space is created into which the reader can imaginatively project herself, experiencing the text as a space to explore rather than a line to follow.” (Hayles 99)

“Readers are consequently less likely to read the text cover-to-cover than open it at random and mediate over a few pages before skipping elsewhere or closing it for the day.  This mode of reading reminds us that in the Middle Ages the codex book was heralded as a great improvement over the scroll precisely because it allowed random reading.  In contemporary parlance, we might say that the book is the original random access device (RAD).” (Hayles 99)

Chapter 7.  Embodiments of Material Metaphors

graduate seminar on word and image in the digital domain, co-taught with Bill Seaman; project by Adriana Silva and Fabian Winkler, database

difference between scientific theory and literary theory:  in science, theory is intended to simplify:  “The point of experimental practice is to reduce this noise as much as possible.  Reduction is good, proliferation is bad.” (Hayles 104)

“Unlike scientific theory, however, the more predictive power a literary theory seems to have, in which it yields readings that can be known in advance once the theory is specified, the less valuable it becomes.” (Hayles 104)

“‘Too many critics, too few texts’ was the way I expressed this situation, leading to a dynamic in which the economics require that old texts must be capable of being read in new ways if literary scholars are to publish new research.... Rather than trying to eradicate noise, literary scholars have a vested interest in preserving it.” (Hayles 105)

scientific theories are generally seen as cumulative or subsumptive; literary theories are not (what instead?)

“Theory, with generalizations distilled from personal encounters with texts, can stimulate scholars to read old texts in new ways and seek out new texts that cannot be adequately understood without the theory.  Maybe now is a good time for a double-braided text where the generalities of theory and the particularities of personal experience can both speak, though necessarily in different voices.” (Hayles 106)

Chapter 8.  Inhabiting House of Leaves

“House of Leaves demonstrates that materialist strategies are also intimately involved in a best-selling novel....  It instantiates the crisis characteristic of postmodernism, in which representation is short-circuited by the realization that there is no reality independent of mediation.” (Hayles 110)

subject as palimpsest, created through the multi-layered inscriptions of the text

ontological status of the book is in question throughout, as the film is revealed in the introduction to be a hoax; “Yet, as the many mages that follow testify, the lack of a real world referent does not result in mere absence.” (Hayles 111)

inscription technologies and surfaces throughout:  “film, video, photography, tattoos, typewriters, telegraphy, handwriting, and digital computers” (Hayles 111)

“What distinguishes House of Leaves is the way it uses familiar techniques to accomplish two goals.  First, it extends the claims of the print book by showing what print can be in a digital age; second, it recuperates the vitality of the novel as a genre by recovering, through the processes of remediation themselves, subjectivities coherent enough to become the foci of the sustained narration that remains the hallmark of the print novel.” (Hayles 112)

“The unreliable narrator, a literary invention foregrounding the role of consciousness in constructing reality, has here given way to the remediated narrator, a literary invention foregrounding a proliferation of inscription technologies that evacuate consciousness as the source of production and recover in its place a mediated subjectivity that cannot be conceived as an independent entity.” (Hayles 116-17)

“I asked him about its publication on the Web.  According to him, the Web was merely a convenient delivery vehicle, an easy way to distribute the book prior to its print publication to acquaintances asking for copies.  But I am tempted to see in this publication history something more, a work that edged toward becoming a distributed multi-sited production, one of whose manifestations was a print book.” (Hayles 124)

“Mark makes a point of underplaying the role of the digital.  He says “HA!” to critics who might think the book was written entirely on a computer, pointing out that he storyboarded the ferociously complex Chapter IX, where print runs riot in many directions on the page, entirely in pencil, a technology he praises for its robustness and reliability.” (Hayles 126)

“The remarkable achievement of House of Leaves is to devise a form that locates the book within the remediations of the digital era, along with the concomitant realization that reference becomes unstable or inaccessible in such an environment, and still deliver the pleasures of traditional realistic fiction.” (Hayles 128)

“House of Leaves implicitly refutes the position Claude Shannon assigns to humans in his famous communication diagram, in which they are positioned outside the channel and labeled ‘sender’ and ‘receiver.’  As readers enmeshed in the book, we find ourselves positioned, like Will Navidson, inside the book we read, receiving messages to be sure but also constituted by the messages that percolate through the intersecting circulatory pathways of the book called House of Leaves.” (Hayles 130)

“The implication for studies of technology and literature is that the materiality of inscription interpenetrates the represented world.  Even when technology does not appear as a theme, it is woven into the fictional world through the processes that produce the literary work as a material artifact.” (Hayles 130)

“Through its material metaphors, House of Leaves suggests that the appropriate model for subjectivity is a communication circuit rather than discrete individualism, for narration remediation rather than representation, and for reading a writing inscription technologies fused with consciousness rather than a mind conveying its thoughts directly to the reader.” (Hayles 130)
