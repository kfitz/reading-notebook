Laurel, Brenda.  Computers as Theatre.  Boston:  Addison Wesley, 1993.


Foreword (Donald Norman)

contemporary technologies of communication and computation offer new creative opportunities, esp. new forms of drama — but control must pass from technologist to artist
Preface

usually think about application and interface separately; interface as no more than that which conveys the application

need to move to thinking in terms of “direct engagement,” which “emphasizes emotional as well as cognitive values” (Norman xviii), leading to “a design discipline in which ideas like pleasure and engagement are not only appropriate but attainable” (Norman xix)

two parts to text:  a poetics of human-computer activity, and its creative and productive implications

Chapter 1.  The Nature of the Beast

interesting potential in computer seen in early games:  “not in its ability to perform calculations but in its capacity to represent action in which humans could participate” (Laurel 1)

interface evolution:  from conversation model to realization that “an interface is not simply the means whereby a person and a computer represent themselves to one another; rather it is a shared context for action in which both are agents” (Laurel 4)

connections between psychology and theatre, psychology and interface design

throw out notion of interface altogether

models of interface:  pre-cognitive science view; mental-models view; recursive view

model of theatre:  drama incorporates performance; technical aspects, when working, are “invisible” to audience

on interactivity:  “It’s not that the audience joins the actors on the stage; it’s that they become actors — and the notion of ‘passive’ observers disappears” (Laurel 17)

theatre as interface metaphor (like Director?)

two reasons for considering theatre as a foundation for thinking about human-computer interaction:  “First, there is significant overlap in the fundamental objective of the two domains — that is, representing action with multiple agents.  Second, theatre suggests the basis for a model of human-computer activity that is familiar, comprehensible, and evocative.” (Laurel 21)

human-computer activity divided into two categories:  productive and experiential; create different computational agents to serve different purposes

why take an artistic perspective to human-computer interaction? example of film

art as “the external representation of things that happen in the head of the artist” (Laurel 30); computer actions are much the same:  “a person participates in a representation that is not the same as real life but which has real world effects or consequences” (Laurel 31); “cut” and “paste” (etc.) as representations of tools and activities

“Designing human-computer experience isn’t about building a better desktop.  It’s about creating imaginary worlds that have a special relationship to reality — worlds in which we can extend, amplify, and enrich our own capacities to think, feel, and act.” (Laurel 32-33)

Chapter 2.  Dramatic Foundations, Part I:  Elements of Qualitative Structure
