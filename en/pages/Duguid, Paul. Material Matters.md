Duguid, Paul. “Material Matters: The Past and Futurology of the Book.” In The Future of the Book. Ed. Geoffrey Nunberg. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996. 63-101.


"I want to argue, however, that there are good reasons beyond either nostalgia or an insurmountable hatred of technology to question the apparent choice between leaping to the new or drowning with the old.  If nothing else, futurologists do have a habit of announcing both deaths and births prematurely." (Duguid 63)

"The forward thrust of predictions tends to insist that we don't look back.  But past predictions, particularly failed predictions like these, deserve more attention than they get.  The point of reexamining them, though, is not to gloat.  Rather, it's to understand where predictions go wrong." (Duguid 63)

"Since the twenties, one way people have known they were watching a film about 'the future'... was the inevitable presence of sliding doors.  The supersession of the simply hinge by automated sliding technology long ago became a visual synecdoche for the triumph of the future.  Yet while the sliding door still appears on the futurological screen, the millennia-old manual hinge endures all around us (even on our laptop computers and cell phones).  One reason it survives, I suggest, is that despite its technological simplicity, time has given the hinge a rich social complexity that those who foresee its imminent demise fail to appreciate.  Hinged doors, after all, are not just to be passed through; they communicate polysemiously.  We can, for instance, expressively throw them open or slam them shut, hold them or let them swing, leave them ajar and hide behind them, satisfyingly kick, punch, or shoulder them, triumphantly barge them open or defiantly prop them shut." (Duguid 64)

"we have a tendency to underestimate what Raymond Williams calls the 'social-material complex' of which technologies are only a part." (Duguid 64)

"to design robust new artifacts (design itself being an act of prediction): it may be important not to dismiss survival as cussed and irrelevant resistance, but instead to consider, in social and historical terms, the sources of endurance." (Duguid 64-65)

"two futurological tropes" that keep us from learning from old technologies:  "*supersession* -- the idea that each new technological type vanquishes or subsumes its predecessors" and "*liberation*, the argument or assumption that the pursuit of new information technologies is simultaneously a righteous pursuit of liberty" (Duguid 65)

"Books, I conclude, are not a hide bound alternative to the freedoms of the multiply linked items of hypertext, but an important social, political, and historical solution to problems raised by the particularity of such linked items." (Duguid 66)

"Accepted by many as an 'agent of change' in the Gutenberg revolution, the book is easily cast as a force of reaction in the information one.  Its material lineaments stand accused of foisting a vast amount of ideological baggage on innocent people." (Duguid 67)

"claims of supersession are, above all else, a significant marketing ploy.  Rapid technological development has increased pressure to sell the new on the heels of the old, no matter how durable the old." (Duguid 68)

"By contrast with our own, in these pastoral societies the author was apparently both alive and suitably authoritative, and the reader naive and suitably subordinated.  The inhabitants of the past saw the book, some have claimed, as 'the natural and only vehicle for a written text' and the text simply 'a transparent window into creative thought' and consequently they suffered beneath the 'tyrannical' voice of print." (Duguid 70, quoting Lanham and Landow)

"Claims of supersession... often escape portraying history as seamless only by the factitious insertion of a single seam, which often falls just behind the claimant.  Beyond this single, uniform rent that frees the claimant from the past, history usually looks not the complex of tessellated breaks or ruptures we are led to expect, but placidly smooth and undifferentiated." (Duguid 71)

"In all, then, I suggest it's important to resist announcements of the death of the book or the more general insistence that the present has swept away the past or that new technologies have superseded the old.  To refuse to accept such claims is not, however, to deny that we are living through important cultural or technological changes.  Rather, it's to insist that to assess the significance of these changes and to build the resources to negotiate them, we need specific analysis, not sweeping dismissals.  Indeed, as Williams argues, proclaiming our distance from the past only prevents 'the reality of a major transition' from being fully 'acknowledged and understood.'" (Duguid 72-73)

"The idea that supersession brings with it liberation provides a bulwark against the darker side of this opposition." (Duguid 73)

"The language of liberty moves quickly to such icons of freedom as the market and the frontier." (Duguid 74)

"Technological futurology occasionally transfers autonomy and rationality from people and societies to machines.  Here, there's a similar exchange.  Information is endowed with human attributes and simultaneously a certain independence from human control." (Duguid 74)

"Many who embrace poststructuralist forays against the codex to support their arguments for the electronic emancipation of information or society too easily forget that these forays were launched to a significant degree because the book was presented not as a prison, but as a key technology of the grand narratives of emancipation." (Duguid 76)

"The desire for a technology to liberate information from technology is not far from the search for a weapon to end all weapons or the war to end all wars." (Duguid 76) -- this is a pretty tendentious point; since the utopian overflow of Barlow/Rheingold/Bolter, I don't think anyone's imagined that the computer could liberate information from technology -- rather, it could provide a technology that allows it to move more freely

"Rather than to think of wine in bottles, each of which has a separate identity, it is more useful to consider information and technology as mutually constitutive and ultimately indissoluble.  Apt images then would be rivers and banks." (Duguid 78)

quotes I. A. Richards, "a book is a machine to think with": "Viewing the book as a machine, we quickly bridge the supersessive chasm some have dug between new technology and the book, as if one were a machine and the other not." (Duguid 78)

"Books are part of a social system that includes authors, readers, publishers, booksellers, libraries, and so forth.  Books produce and are reciprocally produced by the system as a whole.  They are not, then, simply 'dead things' carrying preformed information from authors to readers.  They are crucial agents in the cycle of production, distribution, and consumption." (Duguid 79)

"Arguments against the book, for example, often characterize it not in terms of the whole cycle, from writers to readers and back again, but from the point of authorial production alone." (Duguid 79)

"The implication that technologies are just conduits for information produced elsewhere both denies the material role technologies play in producing information and, as I noted at the end of the previous section, assumes that information has an inherent shape and integrity independent of the system in which it is produced and consumed." (Duguid 82)

"Systemic changes reach beyond particular semiotic effects, altering our understanding of not just what things might mean, but also why they matter." (Duguid 83)

"the increasing individualization and personalization of the production of information." (Duguid 84)

accounting system as precursor to hypertext? (multiple "books" with links between their entries)

"The popularity of hypermedia on the World Wide Web shows that much of the rhetoric of hypertext is quite inaccurate and ineffectual.  Text is not being decomposed into Barthean *lexias*; rather very conventional whole documents, with much of their authority and their material origins putatively ascertainable, are being linked.  Divisions between author and reader, producer and consumer are being technologically enforced." (Duguid 88)
