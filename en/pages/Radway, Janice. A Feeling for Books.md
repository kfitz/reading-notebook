Radway, Janice. A Feeling for Books: The Book-of-the-Month Club, Literary Taste, and Middle-Class Desire.  Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1997.


Introduction

"in attempting to explain the remarkable longevity of a club that uses sophisticated marketing techniques to sell not only individual books but the very idea of taste itself, I have found myself unable to condemn the organization in any simple way for commodifying what I was taught in graduate school should never have been commodified by the market in the first place, that is, literature, art, and culture.  Instead, in attempting to reconstruct the motives and intentions driving not only the club's founders but its subsequent judges, editors, *and* subscribers, I have continually encountered not merely the insistent desire to rise socially through any means available but also deep-seated longings for the possibilities of self-articulation and the search for transcendence promised by education and by art." (5)

"The Book-of-the-Month Club's editors proved compelling to me because they talked about books with a kind of intense fervor and expansive pleasure I had not heard since my conversations with the librarians of my childhood.  They were enthusiastic and openly passionate about books, not deliberately reserved or self-consciously ironic about their own tastes as were so many of my academic friends." (6)

the editors' reader's reports worked not only to "facilitate the day-to-day business of selecting books for distribution, but more important perhaps, they fostered the definition of an imagined community of general readers, both within and without the club, who were fascinated not by the aesthetic intricacies of verbal composition or by the challenge of a unique figural language or even by a new way of representing experience.  Those readers, rather, were understood to be captivated by books in all their immense diversity and by the manifold pleasures of buying them, owning them, reading them, and using them." (6)

"a time in my past when the act of reading was propelled more by a driving desire to know, to connect, to communicate, and to share than by the desires to evaluate, to explicate, to explain, to discriminate, and to judge." (7)

"What preoccupies me now is the effort to understand the peculiar cultural power associated with a particular constellation of behaviors, that is, the activities of acquiring, owning, reading, and talking about books in the United States in the twentieth century." (8)

"The academic, it became clear, was something the people at the Book-of-the-Month Club defined themselves against.  They used the word 'academic' to dismiss books they did not like in much the same way my academic colleagues and I had used the word 'middlebrow' to dispense with texts we judged inadequate." (9)

book simultaneously tries "to provide an account of the pleasures of a characteristically middlebrow way of reading" and to address "the particular ways in which middlebrow culture managed and controlled those it addressed so successfully" (12)

"The materials they selected to create what later became known as middlebrow culture were chosen not only because they were members of a new professional, literary elite addressing the needs and worries of a new class, but also because those books addressed them in highly concrete, deeply resonant ways as persons moving through life in embodied form, that is, as bodies crisscrossed by innumerable, minute stigmata, some highly visible and therefore traceable to past events and earlier conditions, others invisible and undetectable with the clumsy tools of perception and interpretation we have available to us." (14)


1. A Certain Book Club Culture

"It was precisely their role os informed yet nonetheless representative readers that the editors at the Book-of-the-Month Club fastened on as the key element in their professional self-definition.  They thought of themselves primarily as readers of books, and they prided themselves on their ability to read with sensitivity, intelligence, and attention. What they were doing in those long, ritualized conversations about books was not just constructing social boundaries or defining their difference and distance from others.  They were also engaging in a performance of their professional identity; they were displaying for themselves and each other the substance of their subjectivity as a particular kind of reader.  Their reader's reports were only more formalized versions of these performances -- in a sense, scripts for gala theatrical events." (41)

"Like their academic competitors, the editors were constituted as literary professionals by the particular ways they read and wrote about their reading.  I noticed early, however, that two features especially marked their writing about reading as different from the academic practice of critical writing I had learned in graduate school.  Their reports were much more personal than the style of writing I had been taught.  At the same time, they conceptualized the books they wrote about not solely as occasions for extended analysis but, rather, as opportunities for experience and response." (42)

"books were treated not primarily as well-crafted artifacts, as objects of knowledge, but as opportunities for experience and emotional response.  Writing was judged to be good, therefore, whether it occurred in a book or in an editor's report about a book, if it managed to provoke an intense reaction within the reader." (42-43)


2. A Business with a Mission

"In thinking about literary fiction as a particular kind of book with its own specific uses and pleasures, the editors were treating the literary at this pragmatic level as no different from the innumerable other proven categories they dealt with each day.  The value of the literary, finally, was not so powerful as to override ways of thinking about reading that were closely tied to the service and commercial character of the business.  Reading, in this view, was an act engaged in primarily for pleasure but also for additional practical reasons that helped to determine the kind of book to which the reader turned." (67)

"literary writing was judged a failure at the Book-of-the-Month Club when the editors thought that the labor it required of the reader would not pay off in terms of engagement or pleasure." (71)

"The pleasure to be found was apparently not the cognitive pleasure of solving a difficult puzzle or following the trail of a difficult argument.  Nor was it the pleasure of achieving critical and analytical distance on one's familiar world.  Rather, this pleasure appeared to be more emotional and absorbing; it seemed to have something to do with the affective delights of transport, travel, and vicarious social interaction." (72)

one reader's report makes clear that "a literary book must prove amenable to a certain kind of reading protocol.  It must also produce a certain kind of reading experience.  And it must provide a certain obvious meaningfulness as well as an opportunity for the reader to respond actively to the process of discovering that meaning." (72)


3.  The Intelligent Generalist and the Uses of Reading

"Why the intensity of the investment in the mid-list book and in the serious readers who were pictured as the mid-list book's ideal audience? What fear was being expressed when their demise was envisioned as something just over the horizon? Why did the Book-of-the-Month Club's fate seem so inextricably tied to the health of both?" (91)
