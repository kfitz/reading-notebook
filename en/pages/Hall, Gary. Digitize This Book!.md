Hall, Gary. Digitize This Book!: The Politics of New Media, Or Why We Need Open Access Now. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2008.


attempting to free university from neo-liberal agenda:  "the inability to articulate an effective alternative vision for the future, for all their criticisms and complaints in the media, higher education press, and scholarly research literature, appears to have left the majority of academics and institutions with very few options for resisting or even redirecting such changes" (Hall 3)

"information and communication have become a principal terrain through which power relations are established today." (Hall 5)

"one of the principal reasons I am interested in the digital reproduction and publication of scholarship and research is because this is one arena where some academics *have* challenged the forces of neoliberal free-market economics in a reasonable effective manner" (Hall 5)

"Sharp reductions in public funding for universities together with the growing concentration of academic publishing within profit-driven transnational media conglomerates have combined to create a situation in which it is increasingly difficult for libraries to be able to afford to stock books" (Hall 5-6)

"although more books than ever are being published by university and trade presses... a great many academic titles are merely repeating and repackaging old ideas and material" (Hall 6)

"it is not just those in the early stages of their careers -- whose institutions are in effect now letting decisions concerning hiring, tenure, and promotion be made for them by scholarly presses on primarily economic grounds -- who should be concerned.  The current state of academic publishing makes it difficult for nearly everyone (apart from a few 'stars') in those fields where the full-length book is the most valued mode of publication to continue to produce certain kinds of research: research that is intellectually ambitious, challenging, even if at times difficult and time-consuming to read, and that is therefore not always particularly accessible and student friendly.... As a result, not only are the careers of a generation of younger scholars in danger of being damaged, but also the whole of academia risks being intellectually impoverished, as research that breaks new ground and develops new insights and understanding is rejected for publication, and hence dissemination, in favor of publications that concentrate on introducing or collecting the work of previous generations." (Hall 6)

"even if Google *were* intending to make all of the texts they are digitizing available for free in their entirety, a book still has to be published first in ink-on-paper form for Google to digitize it" (Hall 7)

"many universities nowadays provide opportunities for staff to publish their research electronically via local repositories, and to access other stores held by institutions participating in the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) and the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC)." (Hall 7)

"these archives, together with open-access electronic journals, are perceived as offering a solution to many of the problems currently confronting scholars as a result of the decline in state funding for higher education and the increasingly market- and profit-driven nature of the academic publishing industry." (Hall 8)

"For some (and this is understandably an attractive route to take, strategically or otherwise, when applying for public funding), the open-access approach is presented as providing value for money for taxpayers by ensuring they do not have to pay twice for the same piece of research: once for academics to carry out the research; and then a second time to access it in the form of journal subscriptions or book cover prices.  For others there is a certain amount of concern and anxiety over whether open-access publishing can be sustained as a business model, and especially over how academic standards of 'quality' can be maintained in the transition to the digital mode of reproduction." (Hall 8)

"the fact remains that the rapidly increasing process of digitizing the academic research literature tends to be regarded for the most part as having merely a prosthetic effect on the performance of our existing disciplines and 'paper' forms of publication." (Hall 10)

"there has been relatively little *rigorous* or *detailed* consideration of the way in which digital texts... contain the potential, not merely to *remediate* older media forms, and thus deliver a preexisting and more-or-less unchanged content, albeit in a new way, but to *transform fundamentally that content, and with it our relationship to knowledge.*  Neither has there been much discussion of the radical ethical and political questions digitization raises for academic and institutional authority and legitimacy." (Hall 10)

"a number of extremely important ethical and political questions that are being raised by digitization concerning our relationship to knowledge, and concerning academic and institutional authority and legitimacy, are, at best, being taken for granted and treated comparatively superficially and lightly, and, at worst, marginalized or even ignored by arXiv,org, Harnad, Willinsky, and others.  My argument in this book is that it is imperative to address issues of knowledge and its authority and legitimacy in the context of digitization; and that doing so will enable us to see that the ethical and political consequences of open-access publishing extend far beyond, and in excess of, those anticipated and intended by the majority of people who have written about this subject to date" (Hall 12)

"Cultural studies' somewhat moralistic insistence on engaging with the harsh realities of the world around us and associated suspicion of the institution as something that threatens to tame and discipline its otherwise radical political potential (hence cultural studies' concern with inter- and anti-disciplinarity, marginalized and excluded forms of knowledge, and so forth) has led it to pay comparatively little attention to the university in general, and the digital reproduction of academic scholarship in particular." (Hall 16)

"making a move of this kind from critique to creation is an extremely common fantasy among academics, and those working in media studies in particular.  Yet they are not alone in thinking this way.  The notion that digital technology enables people to shift from passivity to activity, to the point where producers and consumers are one and the same, is actually fairly common in contemporary culture." (Hall 21)

"whereas up until now scholars and researchers have given their work away for free to publishers who publish it only to then charge other academics fees to access it, either in the form of the cover price on books and CD-ROMs, or the cost of subscribing to journals and online databases, one of the things that is interesting and important about open-access journals, and particularly archives, is the way they provide academics with an opportunity to take control of the means of production and reproduction and publish their research themselves" (Hall 23)

"My problem with the concept of the prosumer instead concerns the way in which it maintains and reinforces certain notions of production and consumption -- even as it claims these distinctions are being 'broken down' -- that I would argue new media have helped to undo.  For far from blurring these categories, the whole idea of the prosumer depends for its very existence on quite fixed, and somewhat unsophisticated conceptions of 'production' and 'consumption,' as well as the relation between them." (Hall 23)

"Certainly, one of the main criticisms anyone dealing with the impact of digital technology risks facing nowadays *is* that he or she is talking about some rather vague and general possible future consequences of new media, without examining particular material instances of digital culture in detail; or, in this case, without pointing to what a *digital cultural studies* (as opposed to yet another cultural studies analysis of the digital) or a *digital institution* might actually look like, what forms it could actually take." (Hall 26-27)

"the concept of practice continues to function as something of a fetish, similar to the way politics, activism, and 'the street' do in other media and cultural studies-related discourses" (Hall 28)

"there is still the very real danger of conveying the impression that to be involved with the actual specifics of creating with computer media -- with software production, programming, coding, and so on -- is somehow more material, more political, more *real*; that it, too, is to be involved with action, with 'concrete-reality,' with a 'street-knowledge of the net,' as it were." (Hall 29)

"new media practice is not something that extends outside of and that only comes *after* the moment of theorization.  Nor is practice something that comes *before* theory, somethign that the latter then merely provides an explanation of.  There can be no new media practice without theory.  In a sense new media practice has never been 'practical': not only because the practices of new media production -- the work of coders, programmers, designers of human-computer interfaces, and so on -- are invariably informed and underpinned by theory and theoretical investments of some sort, whether consciously or not, dialectically or not... but also because the practical -- along with other sociopolitical referents such as the people, the activist, the street, the community, the multitude -- is *constructed* in and through theory, through strategies of writing, textuality, language, and discourse." (Hall 30)

"Too often the technology acts merely as a screen onto which the fantasy of action, of doing something practical and having an effect, is projected." (Hall 31)

"as the university becomes more and more commercially oriented, far from challenging capitalist free-market neoliberalism and its emphasis on instrumentalism, one vocationalism, and on being useful to business and industry, being 'practical' and 'practice driven' often goes along with the discourses of the new economy and their regular attacks on philosophy and cultural studies alike for being too critical and for not being useful or vocational enough." (Hall 32)

"My point -- which is a multiple one -- is rather that:
1.  There are many more forms of engaging with new media than theory and/or practice (even if this proposition might initially sound counterintuitive or absurd).
2.  Many of the effects of these different forms are likely to be rendered invisible if they are to be recognized only in terms of 'theory,' 'practice,' or some dialectical combination of, or relation between, the two.
3.  If our understanding and analysis of new media is to be effective, we need to be able to 'do' *both* theory *and* practice, while simultaneously challenging any simple differentiation between them (which is perhaps not too far off from what I am doing with this book and CSeARCH)." (Hall 34-35)

"Let's imagine that at some point in the not too distant future it is going to be possible to have an academic equivalent to Napster, eDonkey, Gnutella, FastTrack, and BitTorrent." (Hall 42)

"Building a career, even simply surviving as an academic, is today more than ever dependent on publications.  Yet as both institutions and students have found it harder and harder to purchase texts, the traditional market for the scholarly book has been substantially eroded." (Hall 42)

"Still, a shortage of funds produced by decreasing budgets and the rapidly increasing costs of scientific, technical, and medical journals has meant that, far from expanding the number of periodicals they take, many university libraries are unable to sustain their current holdings.  So even if authors do manage to get published in one of these organs, the chances of anyone having access to their work, let alone reading it, are not necessarily growing; indeed, according to some they are becoming slimmer all the time." (Hall 43)

"What would it be like if it *were* possible to have an academic equivalent to the peer-to-peer file sharing practices associated with Napster, eMule, and BitTorrent, something dealing with written texts rather than music?  What would the consequences be for the way in which scholarly research is conceived, communicated, acquired, exchanged, practiced, and understood?" (Hall 44)

"Most important of all, perhaps, at least as far as many of those working in the humanities are concerned (where, in contrast to the 'hard' or 'exact' sciences, more importance tends to be attached to writing academic monographs than to publishing in peer-reviewed journals), academics and researchers would no longer need to worry about whether their next project was going to appeal to a publisher as something that could be marketed and sold." (Hall 44)

"academics tend not to be too concerned about getting paid a fee for, or receiving royalties from their research publications... the main priority of most academics is to have their research read by as many people as possible, in the hope, not only of receiving greater levels of feedback and recognition for their work, and thus an enhanced reputation, but also of having the biggest possible *impact* on future research, and perhaps even society.  So they are perfectly willing to in effect *give their work away for free* to anyone who can bring this about." (Hall 46)

"One of the things that makes e-print archiving (often referred to as 'self-archiving' or the 'green road' to open access) and open-access publishing in general so attractive to many academic authors is therefore precisely the extent to which, by rendering their work easily available to all those who can access it -- rather than restricting access merely to those who can afford to pay for it -- they *can* make reaching a relatively large audience a very real possibility." (Hall 47)

"I am also interested in it because of the ethical and political questions open-access archiving raises for academic and institutional authority and legitimacy, and the way it promises to transform and redefine our relationship to knowledge." (Hall 54)

"The status and authority of scholarly work *is* regarded as somehow being placed in question by the digital mode of reproduction" (Hall 56)

"new digital media technologies *do* encourage us, or at least provide us with a chance (which is also always a risk), to see academic scholarship and research again, 'in a new way,' as if for the first time, and so account for it and judge it anew" (Hall 56)

"How is it to be decided what is to be included in such an archive and what is not?  What factors lead to a particular text or work being valorized as worthy of inclusion?  In short, what is going to constitute a 'proper' piece of, in this case, cultural studies writing or research?" (Hall 56)

"Currently, an academic text acquires a certain amount of authority and legitimacy in two primary ways.  The first, perhaps the easiest to deal with in this context, is by being 'published.'" (Hall 56)

"The second, and more problematic (at least as far as I am concerned here), way in which the value and quality of an academic piece of writing or research is determined is by peer review." (Hall 57)

"Most academic online-only journals have responded to this challenge to their authority by imitating their paper counterparts" (Hall 58)

"(*Culture Machine*, the open-access journal I coedit, is as guilty of this as any other journal, because if it weren't the likelihood is people wouldn't treat it particularly seriously.)" (Hall 58)

"The problem with the attempt to maintain academic authority in this manner *after* the transition to the digital medium is that, first, it positions electronic publishing merely as a prosthetic extension of print" (Hall 58)

"Second, it assumes, even as we move (albeit not in any simple, linear, or teleological way) from an epoch of ink-on-paper reproduction to one that operates increasingly in terms of bits, pixels, and computer files, that academics are going to continue to take paper more or less as their model" (Hall 59)

"Third, the attempt to maintain academic authority in this manner upholds the belief that digital systems *can*, and indeed *should*, therefore continue to be judged according to systems of peer review -- complete with their social, cultural, and economic hierarchies and filters, standards and values, rules and procedures -- that have their basis, if not their origins, in the ink-on-paper world." (Hall 59)

"At this point questions of ethics -- understood, according to the philosophical tradition of Jacques Derrida and Emmanuel Levinas, as a duty and responsibility to what the latter terms 'the infinite alterity of the other' who places me in question and to whom I have to respond -- come to impose themselves." (Hall 61)

"Even if there is *no* original, ink-on-paper version -- never has been and never will be -- academic texts still have to be written in such a way that they *can* be published in hard form (at least potentially) if they are to be capable of going through the peer-review process and receiving accreditation." (Hall 62) -- I think this is a bit of an overstatement

"writers of scholarly digital works are being required, disciplined even, to seek certification in a form that is not necessarily their 'own,' but which is imposed on them by the academic institution" (Hall 62)

"Is this not to take too little account of the ways in which electronic writing and publishing may differ from that of ink-on-paper, and thus risk restricting the production, publication, and even understanding of electronic texts to that which is merely a repetition of the same, or at least the very similar?... To understand the potential of, and the possibilities created by, digital modes of reproduction and publication, shouldn't we also require a certain openness to alterity, to the unknown, the unpredictable, and unexpected, to precisely that which *cannot* be recognized and subsumed under the familiar?" (Hall 63)

"(Certainly, this aspect of new media -- its challenging of the author function -- is more likely to create problems for copyright, it seems to me, than the 'academic gift economy' and the open-access publishing and archiving of research and publications per se.)" (Hall 66-67)

"Are the pre-established paper standards and criteria for judging, reviewing, and certifying academic work sufficient for responding responsibly and doing justice to digitally reproduced texts; texts whose fluid, unfinished, networked form means they might never be read -- or written, for that matter -- in the same way twice, and which often render highly problematic the distinctions on which critical interpretation traditionally depends: reader/writer, inside/outside, beginning/end, human/machine and so forth?" (Hall 67)

"how is the 'parasite' to be distinguished from the 'guest,' the welcome contribution to the field -- in this case that of cultural studies (but we could raise similar questions regarding literary studies, philosophy, and indeed the humanities and knowledge in general) -- from the unwanted, the illegitimate, the unimportant, the irrelevant, the unworthy, that which is without quality or merit?" (Hall 67)

"Certainly, when it comes to questions of disciplinarity, institutionalization, and of archiving, it is still necessary to choose, to judge, and to make decisions; to elect, filter, and select what is to be contained in the archive and what is not; a certain exercise of power, and with it a certain injustice, thus takes place immediately when an archive is founded." (Hall 68)

"Judgment and decision-making, then, cannot be abandoned or done away with.  The problem is rather with the authority of any such judgment and its mode of performance." (Hall 69)

"A discipline cannot found itself.  That would require it to already possess such authority.  This authority *must* come from somewhere else, somewhere that is outside the discipline and that precedes it." (Hall 73)

"in order to function as a legitimately instituted field of knowledge the discipline must in effect overlook or forget all this, and act instead as if it is beholden to no one but itself for its authority" (Hall 74)

"Who now qualifies as a *bona fide* peer-reviewer, referee, funding application assessor, RAE panelist, or hiring, tenure, or promotion committee member?  And with what legitimacy are they able to make the decision as to what to privilege and what to denigrate or exclude from a given institution, discipline, journal, or archive?" (Hall 75)

"how are the judgments, decisions, and choices inherent in peer review to be distinguished from mere prejudice, bias, whim, fantasy, projection, or transference if their authority and legitimacy are not rigorously examined, discussed, and determined?" (Hall 76)

"What is interesting about open-access archiving in particular is precisely the extent to which it brings into question 'the existing definition and delimitation of knowledge, as well as the conditions of its practice: in short, the *discipline* and the *university*.'  In doing so it enables us to *conceive of a future for the university* in terms other than: either going along with the forces of capitalist neoliberal economics that are increasingly turning higher education into an extension of business or, alternatively, advocating a return to the kind of paternalistic and class-bound ideas associated with Leavis, Arnold, and Newman that previously dominated the university, and which viewed it in terms of an elite cultural training and the reproduction of a national culture." (Hall 78, quoting Samuel Weber)

"digital media technologies not only change the process of accessing, communicating, exchanging, classifying, storing, and retrieving knowledge, but they also change the *very content and nature of that knowledge*" (Hall 81)

"All of which has significant consequences for the process of 'reading'; and also that of peer review, since it is not just the identity of the text or object being read, repeated, judged, or assessed that is 'split' and no longer self-identical, but also that of the consciousness or subject that is doing the reading, repeating, judging, or assessing." (Hall 92)

"Misunderstanding is part of what makes the process of cognition possible.  All of which immediately raises questions for ideas concerning the legitimacy and authority of academic scholarship." (Hall 94)

"Can the institution's desire to ultimately locate the authority of digitally reproduced texts in the paper world (as we have seen with the example of Harnad) not be read as an attempt to 'establish and to institutionalize' a 'system of defense'; and thus as a response to its anxiety over the shift from ink-on-paper to digital publishing and, in particular, the fear that academic texts reproduced using IT may not be so easy to understand or judge?" (Hall 96)

"the peer-review system appears as a means of coping with a certain anxiety and apprehension that digital publications may be out of the control of the institution: it is a means of disciplining such texts, keeping them within defined and measurable (i.e., assessable) limits" (Hall 97)

"for it to be able to judge and decide on the status of texts that are 'born digital,' cultural studies must consist of a nondialectical (or not simply dialectical) aporetic 'opening *of* and *toward*' that which is different, new, foreign" (Hall 99)

"I am not maintaining that the open-access repository I am involved with, with its focus on making a tactical use of the 'real world,' empirical, ethnographic, and experiential context of the contemporary university, is potentially *political* because it appears to respond to the regular calls for cultural studies to move away from the grand theoretical, 'textual,' 'linguistic' approaches that supposedly came to dominate the field in the 1980s and early 1990s, and move back to reality, the material, and the sort of political commitment that is regarded as lying at the roots of cultural studies." (Hall 107)

three approaches to conceiving of open access:  "The liberal, democratizing approach sees open access as enabling the production of global information commons" (Hall 108); "The renewed public sphere approach perceives open access as having the potential to facilitate the creation of a revitalized form of public sphere of discussion, debate, information networking, and exchange" (Hall 110); "The gift economy approach positions open access as helping to establish a new kind of a radical, digital economy of the gift." (Hall 110)

gift economy "provides a model for the subversion of the logic of commodification and for the development of new and radically alternative forms of social, political, and economic organization to supplement or rival that of capitalism." (Hall 111)

"by taking part in a radical, digital system of gift exchange in which people are able to circulate material as free software, open source and open content, and create new kinds of texts like wikis and blogs, open-access journals and archives are often perceived as helping to construct an online economy that promises to fundamentally alter and subvert notions of private property and systems of commodification." (Hall 112)

"open-access archiving has the potential to work in the way described here in *particular institutional contexts* and *at particular times*." (Hall 157)

"a 'media-singular analysis'... helps avoid falling into the trap of privileging one specific instance of digital media and assuming that a whole new cultural regime based on its particular principles and ethos is possible" (Hall 158)

"It is important to realize that an archive is not a neutral institution; rather, as we have seen, it is part of specific intellectual, cultural, technical, and economic/financial networks." (Hall 160)

"As Adrian Johns reminds us in *The Nature of the Book*, up until the middle of the eighteenth century the printed book was an unstable object... As a result, readers had to make critical decisions about particular printed books regarding their identity, consistency, and trustworthiness on the basis of 'assessments of the people involved in the making, distribution, and reception of books'" (Hall 161, quoting Johns 31-32)

"The digital mode of reproduction, however, promises to place us in a position where readers are again called on to respond and to make judgments and decisions about the nature and authority of (digitized) texts, and of the disciplines, fields of knowledge, and registers these texts are supposed to belong to (or not), precisely through its loosening of this much fixity" (Hall 161)

"Open-access archiving may thus require academics to make a larger shift in their thinking and scholarly practices if it is to be accepted than would open-access journal publishing." (Hall 163)

"a common misconception evident in many interpretations of the Internet (and consequently, of open-access publishing and archiving, too), interpretations that perceive the Internet as a new form of public sphere of the kind Habermas outlined... This is a misconception, not only because the difference between public and private is being rendered unstable on the Internet; but also because it simultaneously collapses the significant distinction between the idea of the Internet as a new form of public sphere and the idea that the Internet (and with it open-access publishing and archiving) might help *facilitate* the production of a new form of public sphere" (Hall 172-73)

"the potential challenge to the accepted, established modes of scholarly authority and knowledge legitimation that is offered by the digitization of research literature is not just ethical (in the sense that it poses the question of an aporetic responsibility to Levinasian alterity).  This challenge is also political -- although not necessarily in the most usually recognized sense of the term." (Hall 187)

"So the common is closely bound up with capitalism, and is in fact impossible without it.  It is not that the common and capitalism are completely opposed, with the common offering an alternative to capitalism and the market.  The differentiating factor is rather the relation of exploitation." (Hall 192)

"if cultural studies is to remain consistent with many of its own ideas about itself, at the same time as being politically committed and engaged, it also has to keep the question of politics open and undecided." (Hall 199)

"In order to be political we need to remain open to the pragmatic demands of each particular, finite conjunction of the 'here' and 'now,' whatever and wherever it may be." (Hall 201)

"The open-access archiving of cultural studies, in other words, places us in a position where we have to make the decision over cultural studies -- and with it what its politics is, what it means for cultural studies to be political -- again, as if for the first time (and to keep on doing so, as we continue to be confronted with new texts, which are different in both form and content, and which require us to make new judgments, interpretations, and selections)." (Hall 202)

"The challenge to scholarly legitimization that is represented by open-access archiving is for me not necessarily (or not just, or not only) political in the sense that it conforms to some already established and easily recognized criteria of what it is to *be political*... However, open-access archiving may be potentially political in the sense that one way in which cultural studies *can* think the contemporary university without resorting to either nostalgia for a national culture or the discourse of business and consumerism that is increasingly taking over the institution (not least by means of the sort of process and procedures by which intellectual work is turned into a form of property and source of profit, something that can be primarily bought, sold, and accounted for, and for which property rights are therefore needed) is by keeping the question of thought -- including that of politics and ethics -- open and undecidable." (Hall 204-205)

"these all seem to have placed a question mark for many against something that for the preceding decade seemed so unquestionable.  Namely, the merits of the 'free market,' and the idea that the market and the associated vision of the 'knowledge economy' offer the best of all possible worlds.  Might this not, then, be an opportune moment for academics and intellectuals to productively counter and challenge the discourse of global neoliberalism, managerialism, economism, and consumerism that is currently taking over the university -- not least by experimenting with new kinds of institutions and different modes of exchange, including some of those associated with digital culture?" (Hall 206)

"Since authors are largely in charge of self-archiving their own work (even in institutional repositories), an open-access archive -- in marked contrast to a journal, where the responsibility for publication falls primarily on the editors and selected peer reviewers -- distributes the responsibility for doing justice to the situation among everyone in the field, even if many decide to forfeit or ignore this responsibility." (Hall 214)
