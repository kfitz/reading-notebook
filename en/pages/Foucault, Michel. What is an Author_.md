"For the purposes of this paper, I will set aside a sociohistorical analysis of the author as an individual and the numerous questions that deserve attention in this context:  how the author was individualized in a culture such as ours; the status we have given the author, for instance, when we began our research into authenticity and attribution; the systems of valorization in which he was included; or the moment when the stories of heroes gave way to an author's biography; the conditions that fostered the formulation of the fundamental critical category of 'the man and his work.'  For the time being, I wish to restrict myself to the singular relationship that holds between and author and a text, the manner in which a text apparently points to this figure who is outside and precedes it" (Foucault 115)

writing and death:  "Writing is now linked to sacrifice and to the sacrifice of life itself; it is a voluntary obliteration of the self that does not require representation in books because it takes place in the everyday existence of the writer....  In addition, we find the link between writing and death manifested in the total effacement of the individual characteristics of the writer; the quibbling and confrontations that a writer generates between himself and his text cancel out the signs of his particular individuality" (Foucault 117)

we understand that the task of criticism is not to reconstruct the author through the work but rather to study the work in and of itself; yet, what do we mean by "work"?  "What is necessary to its composition, if a work is not something written by a person called an 'author'?" (Foucault 118)

Derrida and "écriture," which is "concerned with neither the act of writing nor the indications, as symptoms or signs within the text, of and author's meaning" (Foucault 119) -- but it has "merely transposed the empirical characteristics of an author to a transcendental anonymity" (Foucault 120)

need remains to examine the space left by the death of the author, such as the implications of the use of an author's name

"the function of an author is to characterize the existence, circulation, and operation of certain discourses within a society" (Foucault 124)

the "author-function" -- the author as a function of discourse

the "author-function" is not "formed spontaneously through the simple attribution of a discourse to an individual.  It results from a complex operation whose purpose is to construct the rational entity we call an author... these aspects of an individual, which we designate as a author (or which comprise an individual as an author) are projections, in terms always more or less psychological, of our way of handling texts" (Foucault 127)

"It would be as false to seek the author in relation to the actual writer as to the fictional narrator; the 'author-function' arises out of their scisson -- in the division and distance of the two" (Foucault 129)

the "transdiscursive" position of certain "authors" -- "the nineteenth century in Europe produced a singular type of author who should not be confused with 'great' literary authors, or the authors of canonical religious texts, and the founders of sciences.  Somewhat arbitrarily, we might call them 'initiators of discursive practices.'
     The distinctive contribution of these authors is that they produced not only their own work, but the possibility and the rules of formation of other texts" (Foucault 131)
 
"Clearly, in undertaking an internal and architectonic analysis of a work (whether it be a literary text, a philosophical system, or a scientific work) and in delimiting psychological and biographical references, suspicions arise concerning the absolute nature and creative role of the subject.  But the subject should not be entirely abandoned.  It should be reconsidered, not to restore the theme of an originating subject, but to seize its functions, its intervention in discourse, and its system of dependencies" (Foucault 137)
