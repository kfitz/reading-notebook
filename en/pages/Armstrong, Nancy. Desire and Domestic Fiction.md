Introduction:  The Politics of Domesticating Culture, Then and Now

domestic fiction's role in separating sexual relations from "politics," and thus localizing political power; connected to "the rise of the domestic woman" (Armstrong 3)

"To consider the rise of the domestic woman as a major event in political history is not, as it may seem, to present a contradiction in terms, but to identify the paradox that shapes modern culture.  It is also to trace the history of a specifically modern form of desire that, during the early eighteenth century, changed the criteria for determining what was most important in a female" (Armstrong 3)

"Literature devoted to producing the domestic woman thus appeared to ignore the political world run by men.  Of the female alone did it presume to say that neither birth nor the accoutrements of title and status accurately represented the individual; only the more subtle nuances of behavior indicated what one was really worth.  In this way, writing for and about the female introduced a whole new vocabulary for social relations, terms that attached precise moral value to certain qualities of mind" (Armstrong 4) -- and thus, the female becomes the prototypical modern individual

of nineteenth century novels:  "It is only by thus subordinating all social differences to those based on gender that these novels bring order to social relationships.  Granting all this, one may conclude that the power of the middle classes had everything to do with that of middle-class love.  And if this contention holds true, one must also agree that middle-class authority rested in large part upon the authority that novels attributed to women and in this way designated as specifically female" (Armstrong 4)

"It is my contention that narratives which seemed to be concerned solely with matters of courtship and marriage in fact seized the authority to say what was female, and that they did so in order to contest the reigning notion of kinship relations that attached most power and privilege to certain family lines" (Armstrong 5)

"the female was the figure, above all else, on whom depended the outcome of the struggle among competing ideologies" (Armstrong 5)

"readers today remain thoroughly enchanted by narratives in which a woman's virtue alone overcomes sexual aggression and transforms male desire into middle-class love, the stuff that modern families are made of.  As the heirs to a novelistic culture, we are not very likely to question the whole enterprise.... Novels do not encourage us to doubt whether sexual desire already existed before the strategies were devised to domesticate it.  Nor do novels often question the premise that such desire, if it is not so domesticated, constitutes the gravest danger -- and root of all other threats -- to society" (Armstong 6-7)

by historicizing desire, we can begin to understand "why, at the inception of modern culture, the literate classes in England suddenly developed an unprecedented taste for writing for, about, and by women" (Armstrong 7)

no prior history of the English novel explains "why women began to write respectable fiction near the end of the eighteenth century, became prominent novelists during the nineteenth century, adn on this basis achieved the status of artists during the modern period" (Armstrong 7)

failures of both Watt and Gilbert & Gubar:  "Because both these histories of the novel presuppose a social world divided according to the principle of gender, neither of them can possibly consider how such a world came into being and what part the novel played in its formation" (Armstrong 8)

"To describe the history of domestic fiction, then, I will argue several points at once:  first, that sexuality is a cultural construct and as such has a history; second, that written representations of the self allowed the modern individual to become an economic and psychological reality; and third, that the modern individual was first and foremost a woman.  My argument traces the development of a specific female ideal in eighteenth and nineteenth century conduct books and educational treatises for women, as well as in domestic fiction, all of which were often written by women.  I will insist that one cannot distinguish the production of the new female ideal either from the rise of the novel or from the rise of the new middle classes in England" (Armstrong 8)

"In dissolving the boundary between those texts that today are considered literature and those that, like the conduct books, are not, my study shows that the distinction between literary and nonliterary was imposed retrospectively by the modern literary institution upon anomalous works of fiction.  It shows as well that the domestic novel antedated -- was indeed necessarily antecedent to -- the way of life it represented" (Armstrong 9)

"Rather than see the rise of the new middle class in terms of the economic changes that solidified its hold over the culture, my reading of materials for and about women shows that the formation of the modern political stgate -- in England at least -- was accomplished largely through cultural hegemony" (Armstrong 9)

"We are taught to divide the political world in two and to detach the practices that belong to a female domain from those that govern the marketplace.  In this way, we compulsively replicaate the symbolic behavior that constituted a private domain of the individual outside and apart from social history" (Armstrong 9-10)

"politics events cannot be understood apart from women's history, from the history of women's literature, or from changing representations of the household.  Nor can a history of the novel be historical if it fails to take into account the history of sexuality.  For such a history remains, by definition, locked into categories replicating the semiotic behavior that empowered the middle class in the first place" (Armstrong 10)

Foucault "makes it possible to consider sexual relations as the site for changing power relations between classes and cultures as well as between genders and generations" (Armstrong 10)

"Sexuality includes not only all those representations of sex that appear to be sex itself -- in modern culture, for example, the gendered body -- but also those myriad representations that are meaningful in relation to sex, namely, all the various masculine or feminine attributes that saturate our world of objects.  Sexuality is, in other words, the cultural dimension of sex, which, to my way of thinking, includes as its most essential and powerful component the form of representation we take to be nature itself" (Armstrong 11)

"According to Foucault... sex neither was nor is already there to be dealt with in one way or another by sexuality.  Instead, its representation determines what one knows to be sex, the particular form sex assumes in one age as opposed to another, and the political interests those various forms may have served" (Armstrong 11)

"Any attempt to verbalize a form of sexuality that supposedly has been repressed in fact reproduces the distinction between essential human nature and the aspects of individual identity that have been imposed upon us by culture.  This distinction does not allow us to examine culture and nature as two mutually dependent constructs that are together a political function of culture" (Armstrong 12)

"writing actively conceals the history of sexuality by turning repression into a narrative form.  The history so produced constitutes a myth of progressive enlightenment.  According to the Foucauldian hypothesis, however, our thinking is most completely inscribed within middle-class sexuality when we indulge in this fantasy, for the repressive hypothesis ensures that we imagine freedom in terms of repression, without questioning the truth or necessity of what we become with the lifting of bans.  When, on the other hand, we abandon the practice of putting knowledge in a domain of nature outside of and prior to representation, we stand a chance of avoiding the tautology inherent in the notion of repression.  No longer assuming that, when written, desire loses some of its individuality, truth, purity, or power, we may no longer feel strangely compelled to discover the truth about desire.  Instead, we may understand desire as inseparable from its representation and understand its representation, in turn, as part of political history" (Armstrong 13)

"the representation of the individual as most essentially a sexual subject preceded the economic changes that made it possible to represent English history as the narrative unfolding of capitalism" (Armstrong 13)

"My point is that language, which once represented the history of the individual as well as the history of the state in terms of kinship relations, was dismantled to form the masculine and feminine spheres that characterize modern culture.  I want to show that a modern, gendered form of subjectivity developed first as a feminine discourse in certain literature for women before it provided the semiotic of nineteenth century poetry and psychological theory" (Armstrong 14)

"an economy of pleasure in which the novel has been implicated since its inception in the late seventeenth century, an economy that cannot in fact be understood apart from the novel or from the criticism that grew up around the new fiction to censor and foster it simultaneously" (Armstrong 15)

"moral hegemony triumphed in nineteenth century England largely through consent rather than coercion; it was precisely because they were leisure-time reading that such books as _Robinson Crusoe_ were important to the political struggle between the ruling classes and the laboring poor" (Armstrong 16)

"As education became the preferred instrument of social control, fiction could accomplish much the same purpose as the various forms of recreation promoted by Sunday schools" (Armstrong 17)

"Removing the stigma from novel reading no doubt conspired with activities promoted by Sunday schools to combat historically earlier notions of self, of family, and of pleasure" (Armstrong 17)

"If the production of a specifically female curriculum was an important moment in our cultural history, then the inclusion of novels within the female curriculum was also significant.  Until well into the eighteenth century the reading of fiction was considered tantamount to seduction, but in the last decades of that century, certain novels were found fit to occupy the idle hours of women, children, and servants.  At that point, the novel provided a means of displacing and containing long-standing symbolic practices -- especially those games, festivities, and other material practices of the body that maintained a sense of collective identity" (Armstrong 17-18)

"Before it provided a common ideal for individuals who would otherwise see themselves in competition or else without any relationship at all, the household had to be governed by a form of power that was essentially female -- that is, essentially different from that of the male and yet a positive force in its own right.  Although certainly subject to political force, the domestic woman exercised a form of power that appeared to have no political force at all because it seemed forceful only when it was desired.  It was the power of domestic surveillance" (Armstrong 19)

"The novel's literary status hinged upon" the middle class's establishment of "a specialized domain of culture where apolitical truths could be told," such that "[f]iction began to deny the political basis for its meaning and referred instead to the private regions of the self or to the specialized world of art, but never to the use of words that created and still maintains these primary divisions within the culture" (Armstrong 21)

"the emergence and domination of a system of gender differences over and against a long tradition of overtly political signs of social identity helped to usher in a new form of state power" (Armstrong 21)

"The panopticon, Foucault's most completely articulated figure of power, is incomplete in itself as a model of culture.  It requires something on the order of 'carnival,' Mikhail Bahktin's figure for all the practices that, with the growth of disciplinary institutions, were entirely cast out of the domain of culture" (Armstrong 23)

"In the model I am proposing, culture appears as a struggle among various political factions to possess its most valued signs and symbols.  The reality that dominates in any given situation appears to be just that, the reality that dominates.  As such, the material composition of a particular text would have more to do with the forms of representation it overcame -- in the case of domestic fiction, with its defiance of an aristocratic tradition of letters and, later on, with is repudiation of working-class culture -- than with the internal composition of the text per se" (Armstrong 23)

"I want to show how the discourse of sexuality is implicated in shaping the novel, and to show as well how domestic fiction helped to produce a subject who understood herself in the psychological terms that had shaped fiction.  I regard fiction, in other words, both as the document and as the agency of cultural history" (Armstrong 23)

"one cannot -- I think -- ignore the fact that fiction did a great deal to relegate vast areas of culture to the status of aberrance and noise.  As the history of this female domain is articulated, then, it will outline boldly the telling cultural move upon which, I believe, the supremacy of middle-class culture has rested.  Such a history will reenact the moment when writing invaded, revised, and contained the household by means of strategies that distinguished private from social life and thus detached sexuality from political history.  On the domestic front, perhaps even more so than in the courts and the marketplace, the middle-class struggle for dominance was fought and won" (Armstrong 24)

"It is time to consider why the literary institution feels so comfortable with a kind of criticism that began as a critique of the traditional canon and the interpretive procedures the canon called forth.  I can only conclude that in concerning itself with writing by and representations of women, literary criticism has not destabilized successfully the reigning metaphysics of sexuality.  Clearly, by generating still more words on the subject, it has invigorated the discourse that sustains such a metaphysics" (Armstrong 25)

"If my study of the novel clarifies only one point, then, I would like it to demonstrate the degree to which modern culture depends on a form of power that works through language -- and particularly the printed word -- to constitute subjectivity.  According to this premise, as purveyors of a specialized form of literacy, we invariably perpetuate the hegemony I have been describing.  That we do so is especially true when we make novels into literary texts where psychosexual themes control the meaning of cultural information that might otherwise represent some contrary political viewpoint.  When that happens, our interpretive procedures not only conceal the process by which the novels themselves reproduce modern forms of subjectivity.  Our procedures also conceal the degree to which we think and write novelistically in order to make sense of the past and of cultures different from our own" (Armstrong 25)

1.  The Rise of Female Authority in the Novel

"the domestic novel as the agent and product of a cultural change that attached gender to certain kinds of writing" (Armstrong 28)

"But female writing was not only responsible for the gendering of discourse; it was also responsible for representing sexual relations as something entirely removed from politics.  As such, gender provided the true basis of human identity" (Armstrong 28)

"Domestic fiction mapped out a new domain of discourse as it invested common forms of social behavior with the emotional values of women.  Consequently, these stories of courtship and marriage offered their readers a way of indulging, with a kind of impunity, in fantasies of political power that were the more acceptable because they were played out within a domestic framework where legitimate monogamy -- and thus the subordination of female to male -- would ultimately be affirmed.  In this way, domestic fiction could represent an alternative form of political power without appearing to contest the distribution of power that it represented as historically given" (Armstrong 29)

"Writing apparently gained a certain authority as it transformed political differences into those rooted in gender.  To the authority that came with concealing the politics of writing in this way we can attribute the development of a distinctively female form of writing" (Armstrong 30)

the logic of the social contract "was used as a strategy for legitimizing various claims to power" from the seventeenth century on (Armstrong 30); "appeared to lose credibility as a model for political relationships" during the eighteenth century (Armstrong 30)

"It could be said that the social contract lives on as a sexual contract even today" (Armstrong 30)

on fiction embedded in Rousseauan social contract:  "According to Althusser, the power of the contract depended not so much on the logic of exchange as on the figurative power of the contract to constitute the very parties it proposed to regulate.  According to the logic of the contract, each of the two parties must exist prior to the enactment of an exchange.  As a figure, however, the contract creates the two parties who supposedly enter into the exchange" (Armstrong 31)

contract as "the central trope of Enlightenment discourse" (Armstrong 33)

"To demonstrate the novel's implication in the larger historical process that brought the new middle classes into power, I have initially drawn from the works of Rousseau and Hume to suggeset how they transformed the themes of an earlier, aristocratic culture by arguing for the claimes of the individual over those of an elite political group.... But it took Jeremy Bentham's _The Theory of Fictions_ to explain how the power of the social contract was nothing other than the power of fiction.... In saying this, he is simply claiming that the actual distribution of power depends largely on the terms in which we agree to represent it." (Armstrong 34)

"If Rousseau's version of the contract implied that fictions are necessary for the individual to think of himself as a particular kind of self, then Hume's critique of the original contract implied that fictions ensure that various individuals will see themselves in relation to the same form of political authority.  Bentham argued simply that fiction itself was the only thing that held people in subjection to one kind of state and could, if properly understood, allow them to take charge over another" (Armstrong 35)

the logic of the sexual contract

"Historical studies of the novel represent early novels and romances as a rather unsavory lot.  In fact, there is good reason to believe that novels did not become literary works until the twentieth century.  By the late eighteenth century, however, certain novels such as those by Burney and other lady novelists were certainly considered polite" (Armstrong 37)

by the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century "it had been established that novels were supposed to rewrite political history as personal histories that elaborated on the courtship procedures ensuring a happy domestic life... the novels which best exemplify the genre for us today are indeed those which translated the social contract into a sexual exchange" (Armstrong 38)

J.S. Mill and Darwin's detachment of domestic/female realm from political/male realm

"sleight of hand" in texts such as Fredric Rowton's _The Female Poetrs of Great Britain_ (1848) "that both granted women the authority to write and denied them the power to make political statements" (Armstrong 40)

"According to the middle-class ideal of love, or what Lawrence Stone has called 'the companionate marriage,' the female relinquishes political control to the male in order to acquire exclusive authority over domestic life, emotions, taste, and morality" (Armstrong 41)

"If nature decrees women to write 'not as the rivals' but as the 'partners' of men, it follows that women's writing will complement that of men and never be able to engage male writing in a critical manner.  A debate between the sexes becomes especially difficult to imagine if genres are rooted in gender.  Thus Rowton identifies feminine discourse as personal and subjective rather than political or philosophical in character" (Armstrong 41)

"But the belief that domestic life and moral sensibility constituted a female domain was much more than a sop to the woman.  Although it did not seem to be political or economic on the surface, female authority was nevertheless real, for the language of sexual relations itself was considered acceptable feminine writing.  By virtue of their apparent disregard for matters that were supposed to concern men, plots turning on the sexual contract offered the means of passing off ideology as the product of purely human concern" (Armstrong 42)

the sexual contract as narrative paradigm

"By representing this transaction as either a moral or an emotional imperative rather than as an economic necessity, _Jane Eyre_ takes part in the larger cultural strategy underlying middle-class sexuality itself.  As the novel detaches both desire and the need for its constraint from the principles governing the marketplace, it sustains the illusion of Jane's autonomy and therefore the illusion that she controls her personal experience.  The good marriage concluding fiction of this kind, where characters achieve prosperity without compromising their domestic virtue, could be used to resolve another order of conflict, the conflict between an agrarian gentry and urban industrialists, for one, or between labor and capital, for another.  By enclosing such conflict within a domestic sphere, certain novels demonstrated that despite the vast inequities of the age virtually anyone could find gratification within this private framework.  As it became the woman's sphere, then, the household appeared to detach itself from the political world and to provide the complement and antidote to it.  And in this way, novels helped to transform the household into what might be called the 'counterimage' of the modern marketplace, an apolitical realm of culture within the culture as a whole" (Armstrong 47-48)

the sexual contract as narrative process

"The more closely nineteenth century fiction asks us to focus on domestic life and the personal experience of women, hoever, the more it will also insist that the information at hand is natural and universal and hence removed from political history.  Unless we regard representations of personal life and domestic relations as a cultural strategy arising from specific historical conditions and serving definite political ends, our observations will simply reify a nineteenth century model of sexual exchange" (Armstrong 48)

"Novels rewarding self-assertion on the part of those in an inferior position undoubtedly provided the middle-class readership with a fable for their own emergence.  Especially when acted out as the options of a female protagonist, social competition could be sexualized and therefore suppressed even while it was being experienced" (Armstrong 51)

2.  The Rise of the Domestic Woman

conduct books and other pedagogical writing for women created the possibility for "the new domestic woman rather than her counterpart, the new economic man" to be the one "who first encroached upon aristocratic culture and seized authority from it" (Armstrong 59)

"That the relative number of conduct book appeared to decrease as the eighteenth century came to an end was not because the female ideal they represented passed out of vogue.  To the contrary, there is every reason to think that by this time the ideal had passed into the domain of common sense where it provided the frame of reference for other kinds of writing, among them the novel" (Armstrong 63)

"by developing a language strictly for relations within the home, conduct books for women inadvertently provided the terms for rethinking relationships in the political world, for this language enabled authors to articulate both worlds while they appeared to represent only one" (Armstrong 75)

"The illusion persists that there is a self independent of the material conditions that have produced it and that such a self can transform itself without transforming the social and economic configuration in opposition to which it is constructed" (Armstrong 94-95)

3.  The Rise of the Novel

"By the mid-eighteenth century, new forms of writing were contending with those that had long dominated English thinking, each claiming the right to declare what features made a woman most desirable.... But in addition to conduct books, ladies magazines, and such newspapers as the _Tatler_, whose title was supposedly coined out of deference to its female readership, some authors created their idea of womankind out of the most unpromising material of all, namely, the novel.  The novel had a reputation for displaying not only the seamy undersides of English political life, but also sexual behavior of a semi-pornographic nature.  On both counts, it was considered a vulgar form of writing" (Armstrong 96)

"When by the middle of the nineteenth century the new middle classes were entrenched and the British economy had stabilized, the novel was already known as a female form of writing, and the conflict between fiction and the polite tradition of letters had all but been resolved" (Armstrong 97)

"Beginning with Richardson's _Pamela_, then one can observe the process by which novels rose to a position of respectability among the genres of writing.  This process created a private domain of culture that was independent of the political world and overseen by a woman" (Armstrong 98)

"fiction itself demonstrates that by the end of the eighteenth century the same strategies which laid claim to the rights of the individual underwent a form of mutation and acquired the power to control the individual on whose behalf they continued to argue" (Armstrong 98)

Richardson's domestication of fiction:  "In writing _Pamela_, Richardson struck upon a double maneuver that ensured his novel was not a novel in the derogatory sense of the word, even though it was indeed a work of fiction.  He deployed the strategies of conduct-book literature within fiction, and he contained the strategies of the most deleterious fiction -- a tale of seduction -- within the framework of a conduct book" (Armstrong 109)

"If, by Austen's time, sexual relations are assumed to be the specialized knowledge of the female, and if it is in female writing that the terms of such relationships are figured out, then fiction fulfills its discursive function by exemplifying the conduct of relationships between men and women" (Armstrong 157-58)

4.  History in the House of Culture

"I would like to suggest that novels themselves generated our modern conviction that social conventions systematically suppressed forms of sexuality which existed prior to those conventions and made them necessary" (Armstrong 165)

monstrous female as displacement of political concerns, esp. Luddism and other worker unrest

domestic fiction of 1848: Wuthering Heights, Vanity Fair, Jane Eyre, Mary Barton

"I would like to duggest that these novels were making history as they turned scenes of punishment into those that represented order in terms resembling representations of the factory, prison, and schoolroom.  Novels incorporated new political material and sexualized it in such a manner that only one resolution would do:  a partitioned and hierarchical space under a woman's surveillance" (Armstrong 185)

"Domestic novels had once aspired to respectability, like Pamela herself, by remaining free of any taint of erotic desire.  With the Brontes, however, the history of the novel took a contrary turn.  In their hands, domestic fiction began playing out a fierce struggle to socialize desires whose origin and vicissitudes comprised one's true identity as well as his or her possibilities for growth" (Armstrong 198)

5.  Seduction and the Scene of Reading

"This chapter will suggest how the trope of repression creates conditions for communication that maintain a certain form of social contract.  As the individual reads what is outside, he or she appears to be revealing what is inside and receiving, in turn, some liberating or therapeutic benefit" (Armstrong 204)

"The communication situation established by seduction is one where the female subject desires to be what the other desires her to be.  To relinquish the power of self-definition is the whole objective of seducation, as _Pamela_ demonstrates.  But if the woman relinquishes the power to discover a self that she believes society considers to be her true self, then the distinction between seduction and education is rhetorical" (Armstrong 204-205)

"I am convinced that the turn-of-the-century preoccupation with the unconscious arose in response to the question of what women want.  The discovery of hysteria simply refined the question by directing it to the matter of whether or not the daughters of good middle-class fathers really wanted to be seduced.  Modernist authors would decide that in fact women desired exactly what they, as the culture's appointed guardians of courtship and kinship, had declared impermissible.  Women either desired the forbidden or else they were unnatural and perverse.  Their forbidden desire comprised an earlier culture's tolerated sexual practices against which the emergent class once asserted its moral authority.  In other words, practices that appeared to have no place within middle-class culture were in fact necessary to maintain the authority of the middle classes.  These practices were the privileged form of the 'other,' the darkness requiring enlightenment, the lack requiring remediation, the perversion requiring reform" (Armstrong 224-25)

"It is not difficult to imagine how, during the nineteenth century, the novelist's position became problematic in relation to these other writers.  Because the novel -- in England at least -- was written in the language of women, novelists could not really be considered among the professional people and intellectuals.  This was true despite the fact that it was indeed possible for women to enter certain professions.  For the novel uttered emotional truths that were responsible for establishing a specific order of kinship relations as normal and desirable.  But when the modernist novel set fiction in opposition to the languages of a bureaucratic society, a struggle commenced that transformed the formal strategies of fiction along with its political objective.  The outcome of this phase of fiction's ongoing dialectic with itself ensured that fiction would be authorized no longer by common sense -- the body of female knowledge -- but by way of reference to the specialized language of literature" (Armstrong 227)

"Although Dora walked out on Freud and although such a writer as Woolf dealt with psychoanalysis in a less than reverent fashion, Freud's model of sexuality ultimately won out over theirs" (Armstrong 249)

"I would like to suggest that both Dora and Mrs. Brown were markers of historical change.  They came into existence as writing at the very moment when the authority granted for over a century to the record of women's feelings was undergoing revision.  It is significant that, in his case history of Dora, Freud usually refers to himself as a physician, for in saying this he pits the authority of a professional (male) institution against the authority of common sense and a woman's feelings, of diagnosis against commonplace and gossip, of knowledge against self-deception" (Armstrong 249)

"In reality, analysis created mythological figures for the metaphysics of sexuality by endowing modern desire with a biological origin and form.  This mythology rendered the woman's authority over sexual desire -- whether it was manifested in Dora's nineteenth century sensibility or in Woolf's self-consciously verbal displays -- instantly anachronistic.  In the long run, Freud's professional voice and medical mythology determined the course that the discourse of sexuality pursued during the twentieth century" (Armstrong 250)

Epilogue

"I am suggesting that over time the novel produced a longuage of increasing psychological complexity for understanding individual behavior.  I am suggesting, too, that as fiction progressively uncovered the 'depths' of individual identity, a complex system of political signs was displaced.  SIgns of wealth, status, and religious affiliation began to define a 'surface' that had no reliable connection with the self in which true motivations were buried.  As the individual came to be known in this way, a modern form of power, which could not be distinguished from such knowledge, took over" (Armstrong 253-54)

"We ourselves exercise this form of power in teaching students to read the novel as an account of a developing character, as the unfolding of historical events that take place somewhere outside of language, or else as the growth of a verbal artifact.  In each instance, we make the work of fiction transparent.  In each instance, we teach our students to distinguish depth from surface in a way that turns writing into a specific form of individual, into a mirror of a particular world of objects, or into an autonomous world of imagination.  Seldom are we moved to acknowledge how writing creates the distinction between depth and surface, subject and object, or between these and the literary forms of representation.  In suppressing the fact and agency of writing, we also suppress the historical process by which these spheres of self, society, and culture were created and held in equilibrium" (Armstrong 254)
