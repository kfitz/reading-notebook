Lynch, Clifford. “The Battle to Define the Future of the Book in a Digital World.” First Monday 6.6. June 2001. <http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/864/773>


"the prospects for digital books and e-book readers are beginning to capture the public imagination. Much of the discussion seems to be about whether, and if so when, e-books will replace traditional print-on-paper books, and a great deal of the debate is infused with sentimental appeals to reading on the beach or in the bath, the joys of finely printed books, and of browsing in good bookstores." (Lynch)

"What's really happening is much more complex than the emergence of a new kind of consumer electronics device, or a new marketing channel for books enabled by these appliances. A whole group of disparate, long-simmering issues are converging around e-books, which serve as a sort of shorthand, or symbol, for the larger questions. The sentimentally framed questions about digital books and electronic devices replacing printed books are largely irrelevant, an artificial and distracting controversy. Both can and undoubtedly will co-exist for a long time to come and will find their appropriate audiences and market niches. This will, I believe, sort itself out in the marketplace. The real issues are more fundamental: how do we think of books in the digital world, and how will books behave? How will we be able to use them, to share them, and to refer to them? In particular, what are our expectations about the persistence and permanence of human communication as embodied in books as we enter the brave new digital world?" (Lynch)

"In the public mind ideas like copyright are arcane and fuzzy; legislation like the DMCA mostly unknown and esoteric; and furthermore, there's a feeling that somehow books are different from ephemeral entertainment products like the movies and music that are the subject of so many current lawsuits. Books are serious, they capture our knowledge, our intellectual heritage, our cultural discourse. Books have significance that transcends quarrels about who gets paid, and when, and how often, for playing popular tunes. But under the law they aren't that different, and what's happening in the music industry may well be establishing an important part of the future of the book" (Lynch)

"And completely left behind in the focus on reading technologies, control of intellectual property, and the economics of publishing (and all of their broader social implications) is the deep, important, and exciting question of how the digital medium may permit authors and readers to reconceptualize the acts of communication and documentation that have been embodied in the printed book for some or all of the purposes that the book has historically served." (Lynch)

"There are, then, at least three major (though sometimes subterranean) agendas implicated in all the hype over e-books:
-- the nature of the book in the digital world as a form of communication;
-- control of books in the digital world, including the relationships among authors, consumers/readers, and publishers, and by extension, the way we will manage our cultural heritage and intellectual record; and,
-- the restructuring of the economics of authorship and publishing.
The purpose of this paper is to expose and explain the issues involved in these three agendas, and to connect them to related developments in other so-called "content" industries." (Lynch)

"some of the crucial broad social and cultural issues at stake in the transition to the digital world, such as the preservation of our intellectual heritage, the role of libraries, and an assessment of what consumers can reasonably expect as they come to grips with digital books." (Lynch)

distinction between digital book and electronic book reading appliances

"Imagine you have a portable device that can hold 5,000 books. You perhaps stop just purchasing individual books to read; instead, you think about selecting the best supplier of a reference library of books to have available to consult should you need to. You think about choosing a subscription service; in which case the choices that the service makes about which new books to add every week or every month begin to have a major influence on shaping the information and the views available to you. Issues of searching and selecting the right books and the right passages in the books becomes a important function that none of the current reader manufacturers seem to be thinking much about." (Lynch)

"Consider a few other implications: losing access to a single book may be a problem; losing access to an entire personal library built up over years is a problem of a different magnitude altogether. Can books be withdrawn from a digital library subscription, and if so under what terms and with what notification?" (Lynch)

"can external events cause books that we have purchased (or probably, more precisely, licensed) to be withdrawn from our collection without our notification and consent? Such events are largely inconceivable with personal collections of print books." (Lynch)

"What might the books in a personal digital library be saying to each other? They might well be sending inventories of holdings and reading patterns upstream to each publisher that has provided books that are part of the collection, so that the owner of the personal digital library can be notified of new books to add to the collection; they might be trading statistics about how often each book is being consulted, and through what search terms. As e-book readers morph into personal digital libraries, we need to think about what information is being shared, and with whom." (Lynch)

"One set of questions that e-book readers raise is about the future character and operation of personal digital libraries, and their relationship to commercial and non-commercial digital libraries and digital bookstores. Another is how these entities will be distributed across a mix of portable appliances, personal computers, personal storage on network servers, and institutionally or commercially controlled storage and services on the network. These are very large, complex, and serious questions that go far beyond asking whether a plastic-encased machine can satisfactorily substitute for paper pages bound in leather or cardboard." (Lynch)

"Certain specific genres have been a great success in electronic forms, and these are rapidly displacing printed products. For example, bibliographies, abstracting and indexing guides, citation indexes, dictionaries, encyclopedias, directories, product catalogs, and maintenance manuals for complex systems such as aircraft work well in digital form.... All of these genres share several key properties: their readers want to find and then read relatively short chunks of specific text; they are frequently updated; and, in some cases they can be greatly enriched by the larger amounts of content and multimedia amenities that the electronic environment can inexpensively accommodate" (Lynch)

"We can also learn from what has happened as scholarly journals, newspapers, and magazines have moved to electronic form. These shifts have been relatively successful in that the electronic versions have found substantial readership, but they aren't yet displacing the print products. The 'unit' of reading in such works ranges from a page or so (a newspaper column) to a few dozen pages (for a typical journal article). Basically, the printed form has been translated rather literally into an electronic representation for these kinds of content. It's still formatted like print, and is intended to be read sequentially like print" (Lynch)

"It's interesting to note that one easily can find many PDF files of published books on the Internet, and these don't seem to cut into print sales significantly, but rather offer a preview function for potential buyers that probably enhances print sales." (Lynch) -- uses example of National Academies Press

"The central question for these kinds of digital books is whether new reader technologies can expand the marketplace beyond the niche of print-on-demand materials that can't really be published cost-effectively in traditional ways, or of e-books that serve as searchable and conveniently accessible supplements to printed texts. The answer will be determined largely by display readability, but convenience (you can carry the equivalent of multiple heavy printed tomes in one e-book reader), quality (electronic content can be more current and flexible than print content), and economics (how do the costs compare to purchasing printed books) will also be important factors. Also, recall that many appliance readers likely will be purchased on the basis of obtaining easy, portable access to more "hospitable" content such as newspapers and magazines, at least initially and PDAs are being purchased for functions like calendering and note-taking. These machines provide a growing installed base that can allow users to experiment with the convenience of storing, carrying around, and consulting digitized books as an activity at the margins with little additional investment." (Lynch)

"We are also seeing the development of new genres of material that are highly adapted to the online reading environment, built on the early success of types of books that translated advantageously to the digital environment, such as encyclopedias. These new genres are designed to exploit the strengths of the digital medium. A scholarly Web site, for example, links and organizes many small chunks of text with multimedia content and provides the ability to search and navigate among them. It may also include interactive software components such as simulations, and use the communications capabilities of the Internet to build an interactive community around the work and its subject matter." (Lynch)

"Recently there has been a lot of thinking about how to devise intellectual successors to the scholarly monograph that specifically exploit the online environment. One key idea is that while the definitive and comprehensive version of the work will be digital, there will also be a sensible (though impoverished) 'view' of the work that can be reduced to printed form as a traditional monograph. This is critical in providing scholarly legitimacy in an intensively conservative environment that still distrusts the validity of electronic works of scholarship, and will thus be important in encouraging authors to create these new types of works. It allows authors to exploit the greater expressiveness and flexibility of the digital medium without alienating colleagues who haven't yet embraced this medium." (Lynch) -- somewhat alarming that he made this claim in 2001, and we're still stalled out exactly there

"Many of the new genre works (and the genres of works from the earlier print tradition that now have achieved a more natural manifestation as digital databases) raise problematic intellectual and marketing questions about the scope of the work in a heavily hyperlinked world, about the preservability and integrity of the work, about fluidity of content, and the difficulty of identifying a reasonable number of fixed, individually capturable editions." (Lynch)

"Another very interesting problem is that in digital works that permit the reader to find his or her own pathway through the work it is often difficult to tell when one has 'read' the work completely." (Lynch)

"these kinds of works are still experimental and often costly to produce, and they are usually not yet commercially viable (even in comparison to printed scholarly works). Many of the leading projects are subsidized academic works, which are justified by their contributions to scholarship, and the long-term economic sustenance of these efforts and their preservation are serious issues." (Lynch)

"If anything, we are seeing consumer-market developments coming from outside the book industry: for example, expanded special edition DVDs that include alternate cuts of an important film, plus extensive commentaries by actors, the director, etc. - as the first entrants into a commercial marketplace in new genre works." (Lynch)

"Perhaps fiction as storytelling will remain most effective as a genre targeted for printed books (including print-on-demand books), and the future of storytelling in the digital medium will become something different that is still to be invented -- not film or video, which, like digitized print pages, can be delivered over the Net but which does not explicitly exploit the digital environment, but something else. Certain kinds of computer games may point towards one future here; see also the work of the renowned game designer Chris Crawford on the Erasmatron. For another provocative view of a possible future for storytelling in the digital medium, see Scott McCloud's _Reinventing Comics_" (Lynch)

"In the digital world, the palette of capabilities available to the author has been vastly enlarged; there are new ways to communicate, to structure arguments, to provide insights. E-book readers significantly constrain this new palette; the priorities are not flexibility in authorship and reading, but control and familiarity through emulation of the printed work." (Lynch)

"From an economic perspective, we need to keep in mind that there are a lot of printed books, old and new, and a lot more authors who know how to write for the print medium, and that publishers understand what it costs to develop a book for the print medium. For commercial publishers generating a digital book revenue stream for these new technologies is likely to be more attractive in the near term than speculative ventures underwriting revolutionaries and experimenters who are trying to re-invent communication in the digital medium. There's nothing wrong with commercial interests behaving conservatively here, but we need to be sure to honor and empower the innovators, not marginalize or constrain them based on the dominance of commercial considerations." (Lynch)

"Whatever the shape of the future of the digital book, what happens with the availability of the current in-print corpus of material from the publishing industry is going to be important. Perhaps even important enough to keep the new genres marginalized, at least outside of the scholarly world, long enough for the traditional publishing industry to firmly establish new ground rules for digital books - even to define entirely the idea of what constitutes a digital book in the public mind. And this corpus will look very much like literal translations of printed works." (Lynch)

"The questions about digital books and the role of e-book readers aren't simply about the responsiveness of new technologies to the needs of readers and authors; there is also a major agenda concerned with issues of control, economics, greed, and fear. These issues, rather than simple technological inevitability, may play a dominant role in shaping the digital book marketplace, and are central to understanding the promotion of digital books and e-book readers. Indeed, e-book readers may be the price that the publishing industry imposes, or tries to impose, on consumers, as part of the bargain that will make large numbers of interesting works available in electronic form. As a by-product, they may well constrain the widespread acceptance of the new genres of digital books and the extent to which they will be thought of as part of the canon of respectable digital "printed" works, as opposed to databases, video games, Web sites, and other things which are of interest to consumers or scholars but don't have the same legitimacy." (Lynch)

"In effect, by combining technology with the new business and legal framework, publishers can for practical purposes opt out of many of the requirements of copyright such as fair use. They can bypass first sale, subject only to being able to gain consumer acceptance and acquiescence in the marketplace." (Lynch)

"Book publishers do not want to have books follow the path of audio CD content onto the network as pirate digital files and to have to mount a catch-up technological initiative to try to regain control, facing uncertain acceptance with an uncontrolled digital alternative already in place. And they are probably relieved that they have not made more material available in digital form to date, and that for all the reasons already discussed, digital books often remain at a disadvantage to their printed counterparts. Yet the distribution of digital books and the new revenue streams they may offer under new business models are an increasingly attractive opportunity." (Lynch)

"Some content providers seem to have ambitions that are more appropriate for some Orwellian dystopia. I've emphasized the fear factor, which is being fueled by the experiences of the music industry; but there are also lucrative, unprecedented opportunities for new revenue streams - the greed element. Some content owners want to control in infinite detail all use and duplication of material, and to monitor that use, and possibly charge for it on a transactional basis if they don't block it out of hand. Indeed, these databases of consumer behavior may themselves become new business assets and offer new revenue opportunities." (Lynch)

"Certainly one might own several e-book readers, and want to be able to view one's digital books on any of those readers; to loan a digital book to a friend; to migrate it across generations of technology. One might want to print bits of a book on paper for any number of reasons - for annotation, for use in the kitchen, whatever. And of course most people are able to transcribe reasonably short pieces of text by hand from a viewing device to a piece of paper or a word processor.... But the key point here is that copy protection and content management systems track and control copying. They can't take into account why you are making the copy, or who else gets to see or use the copy; they can only control the making of copies and (at best) the number of copies of a work that are permitted to exist." (Lynch)

"One group of uses comes from consumer expectations established by the historic first sale doctrine: the ability to make unlimited use of something once purchased, to enjoy it for as long as the physical object lasts and technology is available to 'play it,' and the ability to resell or lend it. There's a good chance rights management systems can support most of these functions.... A second group of uses comes with expectations about the ability to make personal copies, and even to do some limited lending or redistribution of these copies. This is harder for rights management systems to deal with.... The third group of uses arises from another aspect of the public policy bargain that underlies copyright - the exchange of monopoly rights for a limited time subject to certain privileged uses - fair use being the most prominent example. Here questions of intent come into play and it's unlikely that rights management systems can identify legal uses." (Lynch)

"First sale is the framework that has historically allowed libraries to operate in America. As we move to a world of digital books, licenses, and technical protection systems, there are very real questions about whether, how, and at what price libraries will continue to be able to provide access to this digital content." (Lynch)

"There are also some fascinating social questions about the nature of authorship and audience here as we think more broadly about digital books, as opposed to electronic distribution of print books. For example, what are the reader expectations about updating published work? Is an author ever really "finished" with a book (other than perhaps a novel) in a world of electronic distribution?" (Lynch)

"We are also seeing a series of experiments that create dialog between the author and his or her readers, either following the initial publication of a work in digital form or as a part of a more extended publication 'process'." (Lynch)

"To the extent that digital books replace printed books in today's marketplace, control of digital works is clearly a central issue for publishers. They will be reluctant to make digital books available without confidence that they can't easily be duplicated and redistributed, and will perhaps seek much more control over digital works, say in the ability to implement new pay-per-view business models, to control and monitor use, and to control resale and geographic distribution of their materials. The techniques necessary to establish these controls may run strongly counter to consumer expectations and preferences." (Lynch)

"the new digital genres rely on the richness of the complex personal computer environment, and will not be usable on appliance readers." (Lynch)

"Are we looking forward to the new digital genres, or backwards towards digitized printed pages as we think about digital books? I believe that current appliance readers look backward - but this is not as limiting as it sounds. There is a tremendous wealth of printed books that have already been written, and the vast majority of these can only be translated into the digital environment, not reconceptualized and rewritten for it. There are many genres and styles of discourse that are well suited to the printed book and this will not change. We will continue to produce printed books, and will want to transport these into the digital realm as well as having them in print." (Lynch)

"Standards are going to be critical to building a marketplace in digital books." (Lynch)

"Management standards include cryptographic algorithms and protocols, identity and attribute management for reading devices (including what geographical market the device is in), metadata formats to define duplication and use restrictions on content, and protocols for transferring content and metadata." (Lynch)

"Content standards shape the characteristics of the content we can view on e-book readers. Management standards will help determine how content targeted for e-book readers can be used, shared, and even preserved, and thus such standards have major social, cultural, and economic implications." (Lynch)

"Here are some questions that I think need to be clearly asked and clearly answered. And we need to think hard about what answers are and are not acceptable, and to be prepared to stay with print if we don't like the answers, because the long term risks may outweigh the short-term convenience.
-- Can you loan or give an e-book (or access to a digital book) to someone else as you can a physical book? To what extent to digital books mimic (and perhaps even improve upon) physical books, and to what extent do they break with that tradition? What other constraints on usage (for example, printing) exist?
-- Do you own *objects* or *access*? If your library of e-books is destroyed or stolen, can you replace it without purchasing the content again simply by providing proof of license or purchase? One very interesting service is a registry that allows you to replace your e-books if you lose your appliance.
-- From whom are you really obtaining content - the e-book reader vendor, a publisher, or some other party? Who has to stay in business in order to ensure your continued ability to use that content? What happens if the source of your content goes out of business?
-- Can you copy an e-book for private, personal use? If you own two readers, can you move a digital book from one to the other without having to purchase it again?
-- Do you have the right and the ability to reformat an e-book or a digital book in response to changes in standards or technologies or do you need to repurchase it? What happens when you upgrade or replace your e-book reader with another one? What happens when you replace the PC that might house your "library"? What happens if you replace one brand of e-book reader with another, perhaps because your reader vendor goes out of business?
-- Do you have to obtain e-books on a pay-per-view or other limited time rental basis or do you buy a perpetual license to the content, or ownership of a copy?
-- What are the policies of the content provider with regard to your privacy and to usage monitoring? What limitations does your book reader technology place on the ability of a content supplier to collect usage data?"  (Lynch)

"It will be important to clarify the privacy and use monitoring issues that surround digital books and e-books in a library context. And libraries will also be very sensitive to the terms of licensing or purchase agreements; these must preserve values such as free speech and discourse. Libraries want to ensure that they have copies of the works that can be incorporated in permanent collections for continued access, as opposed to pay-per-view or expiring versions of the works. Libraries need the ability to migrate these works in response to changing technologies. Libraries recently faced the threat of vanishing collections through license agreements for electronic information that had a finite term of use. They are now beginning to address this successfully in license negotiations with content providers. With e-books they may now face a new threat, planned content obsolescence." (Lynch)

"We view some works as experiential, with no strong expectation of ever being able to experience them a second time (a play, a live performance). Others we regard as more permanent, but still perhaps ephemeral. They may not be obtainable forever, or we may know we would have to go to a vast amount of trouble to encounter them again after their season has past (television broadcasts, advertisements on television or radio, software). Some we regard as permanent. We acquire them with the assumption that we can keep them as long as we want. We further assume that they have been made part of our intellectual and cultural record, and that we could gain access to them through institutions such as libraries if we did not purchase them. Most books - indeed the vast majority of printed works - are in this final category.
     We have been able to keep books for a lifetime, though they may be long out of print and out of fashion or commercial viability, to consult them again and again, though their pages may become brittle and their bindings fragile. We have been able to pass books on to our children, our nephews and nieces, to share them with friends, to keep them in libraries for future generations to learn from and enjoy. Can we accept a world where this is impossible?" (Lynch)

"We know that we do not fully understand how to preserve digital content; today there is no 'general theory', only techniques. The best understanding today is that preservation of works like digital books or sound recordings will be accomplished by migrating content (bits) and translating from obsolete to current formats, rather than by relying on the longevity of specific storage media and the hardware that reads such media. It is essential that the legal and business frameworks for content honor preservation and that they permit such migration of content." (Lynch)

"It is vital that individual consumers, and not just cultural memory institutions, have the capability to retain indefinitely the works that they acquire and to preserve them. This of course does not mean there is no role for pay-per-view in the economy of intellectual property. It means that for the vast majority of works, and certainly for digital works that will carry the same cultural role and importance that the printed book carries today, arrangements that go beyond pay-per-view to permanent access and 'ownership' of copies will be essential as a matter of public policy." (Lynch)

"In the digital world, with its much-enhanced capabilities to track the disposition of copies of works and where access so often substitutes for possession, it is all too easy to envision legal demands for post-publication withdrawal, editing, or censorship of works that would be able to reach every copy of that work in existence, utterly undermining assumptions about the integrity of our cultural and intellectual record and providing the courts and the government with unprecedented and dangerous capabilities to re-write that record at will. To be sure, the ability to bind an annotation to all copies of a work indicating plagiarism, scientific misconduct or fraud, or other attributes that the reader should be aware of may well be desirable, if used wisely. However, the ability to censor or withdraw works on a comprehensive basis is, to my mind, one of the most terrifying capabilities that may be enabled by the new digital environment." (Lynch)

"But we must not let the hype about a technological update to the printed book - the move from printed book to e-book reader - trivialize the enormous social implications of the change that is starting to occur. These new technologies come with a potentially steep social price. They provide new levels of control, monitoring, and usage restrictions for digital books that may well go beyond what consumers are accustomed to with physical print books, and they create serious questions about our ability to manage, preserve, and provide access to our cultural and intellectual heritage." (Lynch)

"As we think about the migration of authoring to the digital medium, the book - rather than other cultural products such as musical works - should be the benchmark against which we measure and test our assumptions and beliefs about the roles and uses of intellectual property in the new environment." (Lynch)

"The most compelling case for ebooks as relatively literal of the printed book is based on greater convenience and ubiquity of access, and somewhat enhanced use. The case for digital books broadly, as new genres of works, is about more effective communication of ideas, enhanced teaching and learning, and renewed creativity. While the first case is a good one, if the price is not too high (in social as well as economic terms), the second case is truly compelling and inspiring. The future digital book will take us far beyond today's printed books and publishing industry, in many different and sometimes unexpected directions, though our points of departure will inevitably be an important influence." (Lynch)
