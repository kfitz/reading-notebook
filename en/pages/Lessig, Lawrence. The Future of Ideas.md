Lessig, Lawrence. The Future of Ideas: The Fate of the Commons in a Connected World. New York: Random House, 2001.


"All around us are the consequences of the most significant technological, and hence cultural, revolution in generations. This revolution has produced the most powerful and diverse spur to innovation of any in modern times. Yet a set of ideas about a central aspect of this prosperity — 'property' — confuses us. This confusion is leading us to change the environment in ways that will change the prosperity. Believing we know what makes prosperity work, ignoring the nature of the actual prosperity all around, we change the rules within which the Internet revolution lives. These changes will end the revolution." (Lessig 5)

"The struggle against these changes is not the traditional struggle between Left and Right or between conservative and liberal. To question assumptions about the scope of 'property' is not to question property. I am fanatically pro-market, in the market’s proper sphere.... Instead, the real struggle at stake now is between *old* and *new*. The story on the following pages is about how an environment designed to enable the new is being transformed to protect the old — transformed by courts, by legislators, and by the very coders who built the original Net." (Lessig 6)

"Digital technology could enable an extraordinary range of ordinary people to become part of a *creative* process. To move from the life of a 'consumer' (just think about what that word means — passive, couch potato, *fed*) of music — and not just music, but ﬁlm, and art, and commerce — to a life where one can individually and collectively participate in making something new." (Lessig 9)

assumptions about culture and ownership:  "that control is good, and hence more control is better; that progress always comes from dividing resources among private owners; that the more dividing we do, the better off we will be; that the free is an exception, or an imperfection, which depends upon altruism, or carelessness, or a commitment to communism." (Lessig 13)

"The argument of this book is that always and everywhere, free resources have been crucial to innovation and creativity; that without them, creativity is crippled. Thus, and especially in the digital age, the central question becomes not whether government or the market should control a resource, but whether a resource should be controlled at all. Just because control is possible, it doesn’t follow that it is justified. Instead, in a free society, the burden of justification should fall on him who would defend systems of control." (Lessig 14)

"To those who argue that control is necessary if innovation is to occur, and that more control will yield more innovation, the Internet is the simplest and most direct reply. For as I will show in the chapters that follow, the defining feature of the Internet is that it leaves resources free." (Lessig 14)

on the commons: "My central claim throughout is that there is a benefit to resources held in common and that the Internet is the best evidence of that benefit.  As we will see, the Internet forms an *innovation commons*.  It forms this commons not just through norms, but also through a specific technical architecture." (Lessig 23)

different layers of commons -- content, code, physical -- can be either free or controlled

"free resources, or resources held in common, *sometimes* create more wealth and opportunity for society than those same resources held privately." (Lessig 86)

"Where the resource has a value *because of its openness* -- where its value increases just because more use it; where 'the more the merrier' -- then it makes sense to attribute much of the value of this resource to the 'publicness' of the resource." (Lessig 87-88)

"The system of control that we erect for rivalrous resources (land, cas, computers) *is not necessarily appropriate* for nonrivalrous resources (ideas, music, expression).  Indeed, the *same system for both kinds of resources may do real harm*." (Lessig 95)

"Intellectual property does this by giving the producers a limited exclusive right over their intellectual property, so they can recover the costs of producing that property and receive a sufficient return to give them the incentives to produce that property. A 'sufficient return,' however, is not perfect control, and intellectual property law does not, therefore, give authors or inventors perfect control. The basic premise, found in our Constitution, is that 'neither the creator of a new work of authorship nor the general public ought to be able to appropriate all the benefits that ﬂow from the creation of a new, original work.' Instead, some of that benefit ought to be reserved to the public, in common." (Lessig 97)

"In the first hundred years, Congress retrospectively extended the term of copyright once. In the next fifty years, it extended the term once again. But in the last forty years, Congress has extended the term of copyright retrospectively eleven times. Each time, it is said, with only a bit of exaggeration, that Mickey Mouse is about to fall into the public domain, the term of copyright for Mickey Mouse is extended." (Lessig 107)

"As Judge Richard A. Posner has written, '[T]he absence of copyright protection is, paradoxical as this may seem, a benefit to authors as well as a cost to them.' It is a benefit because, as we’ve seen already, creative works are both an input and an output in the creative process; if you raise the cost of the input, you get less of the output." (Lessig 108)

"Cyberspace has no nature. How it is — what barriers there are—is a function of its design, its code. Thus, in this abstract sense, it makes no sense to speak about the nature of this system that is wholly designed by man. Its nature is as man designs it." (Lessig 121)

"A peer-to-peer network is one where the content is being served not by a single central server, but by equal, or 'peer,' machines linked across the network." (Lessig 134)

"The story I want to tell is not about the death of innovation generally; it is about the relocation of innovation form the diverse, decentralized Internet back to the institutions that policed innovation before." (Lessig 140)

"These limitations distinguish copyright as property from ordinary property. And that distinction suggests the trouble with direct analogy from laws protecting burglar alarms to laws protecting code protecting copyrighted work. If copyright law must protect fair use — meaning the law cannot protect copyrighted material without leaving space for fair use — then laws protecting code protecting copyrighted material should also leave room for fair use." (Lessig 188)

"For some kinds of innovations, patents are extremely likely to induce more innovation. In particular, in theory, where innovation is independent, or noncumulative (meaning one invention is essentially separate from another), then economists predict that patents will clearly benefit innovation. Likewise, even where innovation is cumulative, if the use of the patent is clear, then in principle, the original patent holder will have a strong incentive to license a patent to follow-on innovators. But here, economists have an important qualification: If we don’t know which direction an improvement is likely to take, then licensing may not occur, and patents here may actually do harm." (Lessig 205)

"each of these examples is motivated by a common idea or common attitude. In each, an attitude of control, perfected by an idea about property, is in tension with a system that protects a commons. And in each, the idea about property prevails." (Lessig 236)
