Shatz, David. Peer Review: A Critical Inquiry.  Lanham, Md.: Rowman & Littlefield, 2004.


Acknowledgments

"A foundational principle of peer review is that criticism by others can improve a work.  That thesis, I think, is amply confirmed by the present book." (Shatz ix)


Introduction

"The peer review system is often described as a system of certification, and indeed it is, in two senses:  acceptance to a journal or publishing house via peer review certifies a body of work, and it also certifies the scholar who produced it." (Shatz 1)

"Peer review is a mechanism... for quality control; it protects us from contamination by error and poor argument, and affords us truth or contributions to attaining truth." (Shatz 1)

"Peer reviewed articles and books are the gold standard as far as hiring, tenure, and promotion committees are concerned.  Such committees often look askance at publications that were invited and not peer reviewed.  What does not pass peer review, goes the thinking, has no claim to be a valid contribution to human knowledge." (Shatz 1-2) -- and thus the suggestion seems to be that the only readers capable of determining the value of a text are the pre-publication anonymous ones selected by a journal or press's editor

"empirical studies of peer review published during the past quarter century" found that "peer reviewers do a poor job of controlling quality.... Referees are biased for authors from prestigious institutions and against authors from nonprestigious ones.... Referees are biased toward papers that affirm their prior convictions.... Referees are biased against innovation and/or are poor judges of quality" (Shatz 2)

"The cumulative effect of the studies and of experience with peer reviewed articles is to suggest, critics say, that the system does not, in fact, always work.  It suffers from widespread bias, subjectivity, and incompetence -- and therefore should be reformed or replaced." (Shatz 3)

"The aim of the present volume is to examine critical ethical and epistemological issues that lie at the heart of current scholarly debate about peer review and to evaluate various arguments and proposals for altering the system." (Shatz 4)

"Surprisingly, this is the first book-length study of peer review that utilizes methods and resources of contemporary philosophy.  In fact, it is the first wide-ranging treatment of the subject by a scholar in the humanities." (Shatz 4)

"Besides its ethical aspect, the topic also has dimensions of epistemological significance, since it implicates such concepts as truth, bias, relativism, conservatism, consensus, and standards of good argument.  Philosophers and other humanities scholars have produced a voluminous literature on these subjects.  Yet they have not applied their approaches to these topics to peer review itself, that is, to the very procedures and practices that produced much of the voluminous literature in ethics, epistemology, and so many other fields." (Shatz 4) -- goes on to note how striking this aporia is when viewed against the extensive literature on the subject in the social and natural sciences

"In the humanities, more than sciences, and certainly more than mathematics, we live in disagreement; dispute is the animating force of the profession.  Correlatively, in the sciences you can sometimes *show* that a peer review was wrong, while in the humanities you very rarely can.  Thus there is a far more concrete basis for criticizing the review process in the sciences." (Shatz 6)

"an assessment of peer review requires empirical studies, which practitioners of the humanities are not trained to undertake; their tenure and promotion committees, moreover, may not regard an empirical study on peer review as a contribution to a humanities scholar's field of expertise" (Shatz 7)

"When people refer to the historical advent of peer review, they sometimes date it by the shift from review by an editor to review by external referees." (Shatz 8)

some acknowledgment that different fields might have different needs for peer review -- dangers, for instance, in publishing untested/unverified claims in medicine (but few such dangers in the humanities?)

"Much of western thinking has displayed a commitment to the 'liberal' idea that truth is most like to emerge when ideas proliferate and come into clash with one another in the 'marketplace' of ideas.  But peer review, far from seeking to proliferate ideas, seeks to limit the number and range of ideas that reach the public -- indeed, the higher a journal's rejection rate, the better the journal is thought to be" (Shatz 10) -- but uses this point to suggest that the marketplace idea is false, and that limiting the flow of communication is a good idea

similarly argues in favor of the institution of blind peer review as a means of avoiding personal bias in the review process, and argues against accusations of intellectual conservatism (in which reviewers support dominant paradigms) by suggesting that conservatism is a good thing

"invited articles ought not to be denigrated by hiring, tenure, and promotion committees, for they are subject to postpublication review by experts whom the committees consult.  These experts have the benefit of hindsight -- they know to what extent the article has influenced the field.  This, I maintain, makes the postpublication review potentially more helpful than the knowledge an article was peer reviewed." (Shatz 11)


Chapter One:  Peer Review and the Marketplace of Ideas

"It is hard to say who would have the biggest nightmare were open review implemented:  readers who have to trek through enormous amounts of junk before finding articles they find rewarding; serious scholars who have to live with the depressing knowledge that flat earth theories now can be said to enjoy 'scholarly support'; or a public that finds the medical literature flooded with voodoo and quackery.  Let us not forget, either, that editors and sponsoring universities would lose power and prestige even while their workload as judges would be eliminated." (Shatz 16)

"If I am right that peer review and the marketplace conception do not sit well together, we face a choice between abandoning peer review and abandoning the marketplace conception.  In my opinion it is the marketplace conception that has to go; peer review stays." (Shatz 19) -- note however the way that this cleverly associates anyone opposed to the current modes of peer review with a conservative form of open-market economics, rather than acknowledging that there's another mode of much more oligarchical economics operative behind the peer review model Shatz champions

an objection to the argument from abundance:  "if financial considerations are all-important, why aren't authors given the option of vanity publishing -- paying for journal space when an article is not recommended by referees?" (Shatz 22) -- on the one hand, a good point; we don't want scholarly publishing to descend into vanity publishing -- but on the other hand, we're now in a worst-of-both-worlds situation, in which a number of journals require authors to pay for space when their articles *have* been recommended by referees -- and thus there is both an economics of scarcity and a requirement that the authors themselves fund their publishing

"if scholarship involves the proliferation of knowledge, that goal should not be subordinated to the need to generate a mechanism for fashioning credentials" (Shatz 23)

"Suppose we created a system by which (perhaps paid) referees would continue to provide feedback, but authors were free to do as they wished with that feedback; or a system in which everything would be published -- including whatever referees' comments remain after author and referee exchange reactions.  Such systems would also spur authors to produce quality, because how their work is received will determine their professional standing.  Some authors will make bad decisions.  But is it worth excluding so much material just to prevent those bad decisions?" (Shatz 26)

"our system of peer review implies a rejection of the marketplace conception, the very conception on which other features of academic life seem to depend.  This result puts a great deal of pressure on liberals to develop nonmarket defenses of their positions or else abandon those positions." (Shatz 27)
