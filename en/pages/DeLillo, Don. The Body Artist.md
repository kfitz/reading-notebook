DeLillo, Don.  The Body Artist.  New York:  Scribner:  2001.


“You know more surely who you are on a strong bright day after a storm when the smallest falling leaf is stabbed with self-awareness.” (DeLillo 7)

“She tended lately to place herself, to insert herself into certain stories in the newspaper.  Some kind of daydream variation.  She did it and then became aware she was doing it and then sometimes did it again a few minutes later with the same or a different story and then became aware again.” (DeLillo 14)

“You separate the Sunday sections and there are endless identical lines of print with people living somewhere in the words and the strange contained reality of paper and ink seeps through the house for a week and when you look at a page and distinguish one line from another it begins to gather you into it and there are people being tortured halfway around the world, who speak another language, and you have conversations with them more or less uncontrollably until you become aware you are doing it and then you stop, seeing whatever is in front of you at the time, like half a glass of juice in your husband’s hand.” (DeLillo 19)

“It was his coffee and cup.  Touch his cup and he looks at you edgewise, with the formal one-eyed glare of a boxer touching gloves.  But she know she was making this up because he didn’t give a damn what you did with his cup.” (DeLillo 20)

“Or you become someone else, one of the people in the story, doing dialogue of your own devising.  You become a man at times, living between the lines, doing another version of the story.” (DeLillo 20)

“Her body felt different to her in ways she did not understand.  Tight, framed, she didn’t know exactly.  Slightly foreign and familiar.  Different, thinner, didn’t matter.” (DeLillo 33)

“When the phone rang she did not look at it the way they do in the movies.  Real people don’t look at ringing phones.” (DeLillo 34)

“She began to pick up the phone.  She used a soft voice at first, not quite her own, a twisted tentative other’s voice, to say hello, who is this, yes.” (DeLillo 36)

“The plan was to organize time until she could live again.” (DeLillo 37)

“After the first days back she began to do her breathing exercises.  There was bodywork to resume, her regimen of cat stretch and methodical contortion.” (DeLillo 37)

“She spent hours at the computer screen looking at a live-streaming video feed from the edge of a two-lane road in a city in Finland.  It was the middle of the night in Kotka, in Finland, and she watched the screen.  It was interesting to her because it was happening now, as she sat here, and because it happened twenty-four hours a day, facelessly, cars entering and leaving Kotka, or just the empty road in the dead times.  The dead times were best.” (DeLillo 38)

“She didn’t know the meaning of this feed but took it as an act of floating poetry.  It was best in the dead times.  It emptied her mind and made her feel the deep silence of other places, the mystery of seeing over the world to a place stripped of everything but a road that approaches and recedes, both realities occurring at once, and the numbers changed in the digital display with an odd and hollow urgency, the seconds advancing toward the minute, the minutes climbing hourward, and she sat and watched, waiting for a car to take fleeting shape on the roadway.” (DeLillo 38-39)

“This is the kind of conversation you ought to have with someone else.  I don’t know how to have these conversations.” (DeLillo 39)

“He sat on the edge of the bed in his underwear.  In the first seconds she thought he was inevitable.  She felt her way back in time to the earlier indications that there was someone in the house and she arrived at this instant, unerringly, with her perceptions all sorted and endorsed.” (DeLillo 41)

“His underwear consisted of white trunks and a T-shirt that was too big and she studied him up and down, openly, everywhere.
‘It is not able,’ he said.
‘But why are you here?  And have you been here for long?’
He dropped his head and appeared to think about these matters as if working out the details of a complicated problem.” (DeLillo 43-44)

“She found the distance interesting, the halting quality of his speech and actions, the self-taught quality, his seeming unconcern about what would happen to him now.  Not apathy or indifference, she thought, but his limited ability to consider the implications.  She wasn’t sure what it meant to him, being found in someone else’s house.” (DeLillo 44-45)

“She amused herself by thinking he’d come from cyberspace, a man who’d emerged from her computer screen in the dead of night.  He was from Kotka, in Finland.” (DeLillo 45)

“It was always as if.  He did this or that as if.  She needed a reference elsewhere to get him placed.” (DeLillo 45)

“She whispered, ‘Talk to me.’
...
‘Talk to me.  I am talking,’ he said.
She thought she understood what he meant by this.  There was a certain futility in his tone, an endlessness of effort suggesting things he could not easily make clear to her no matter how much he said.  Even his gestures seemed marked by struggle.” (DeLillo 46)

Mr. Tuttle says “Alone by the sea.”  Lauren thinks:  “Four words only.  But he’d placed her in a set of counter-surroundings, of simultaneous insides and outsides.  The house, the sea-planet outside it, and how the word alone referred to her and to the house and how the word sea reinforced the idea of solitude but suggested a vigorous release as well, a means of escape from the book-walled limits of the self.” (DeLillo 48)

“She knew it was foolish to examine so closely.  She was making things up.  But this was the effect he had, shadow-inching through a sentence, showing a word in its facets and aspects, words like moons in particular phases.” (DeLillo 48)

“He talked.  After a while she began to understand what she was hearing.  It took many levels of perception.  It took whole social histories of how people listen to what other people say.  There was a peculiarity in his voice, a trait developing even as he spoke, that she was able to follow to its source....
It wasn’t outright impersonation but she heard elements of her voice, the clipped delivery, the slight buzz deep in the throat, her pitch, her sound, and how difficult at first, unearthly almost, to detect her own voice coming from someone else, from him, and then how deeply disturbing.” (DeLillo 50)

“He gestured as he spoke, moving his had to the words, and she began to realize she’d said these things to Rey, here in the house, or things similar.” (DeLillo 51)

“...and maybe it’s a hawk, she doesn’t know, that keeps the birds away sometimes, or a jay that mimics a hawk...” (DeLillo 53)

“Her bodywork made everything transparent.  She saw and thought clearly, which might only mean there was little that needed seeing and not a lot to think about.” (DeLillo 57)

“She began to work naked in a cold room.  She did her crossovers on the bare floor, and her pelvic stretches, which were mockingly erotic and erotic both, and her slow-motion repetitions of everyday gestures, checking the time on your wrist or turning to hail a cab, actions quoted by rote in another conceptual frame, many times over and now slower and over, with your mouth open in astonishment and your eyes shut tight against the intensity of passing awareness.” (DeLillo 58)

Mr. Tuttle talking to her as Rey:  “He was talking to her, not to a screenwriter in Rome or Los Angeles.  It was Rey in his role of charming fatalist, reciting the history of his addiction to nicotine, and she heard her name along the way, the first time Mr. Tuttle had used it.” (DeLillo 61)

“She looked at him, a cartoon head and body, chinless, stick-figured, but he knew how to make her husband live in the air that rushed from his lungs into his vocal folds — air to sounds, sounds to words, words the man, shaped faithfully on his lips and tongue.” (DeLillo 62)

“She looked at her face in the bathroom mirror and tried to understand why it looked different from the same face downstairs, in the full-length mirror in the front hall, although it shouldn’t be hard to understand at all, she thought, because faces look different all the time and everywhere, based on a hundred daily variables, but then again, she thought, why do I look different?” (DeLillo 63)

“She was in town, driving down a hilly street of frame houses, and saw a man sitting on his porch, ahead of her, through trees and shrubs, arms spread, a broad-faced blondish man, lounging.  She felt in that small point in time, a flyspeck quarter second or so, that she saw him complete.  His life flew open to her passing glance.  A lazy and manipulative man, in real estate, in fairview condos by a mosquito lake.  She knew him.  She saw into him.  He was there, divorced and drink-haunted, emotionally distant from his kids, his sons, two sons, in school blazers, in the barest blink.
A voice recited the news on the radio.
When the car moved past the house, in the pull of the full second, she understood that she was  not looking at a seated man but at a paint can placed on a board that was balanced between two chairs.  The white and yellow can was his face, the board was his arms and the mind and heart of the man were in the air somewhere, already lost in the voice of the news reader on the radio.” (DeLillo 70)

“It was time to sand her body.  She used a pumice stone on the bottoms of her feet, working circular swipes, balls, heels, and then resoaped the foot and twisted it up into her hand again.  She liked to hold a foot in a hand.  She patiently razed the lone callus, stretching the task over days, lost in it, her body coiled in a wholeness of intent, the kind of solemn self-absorption that marks a line from childhood.
She had emery boards and files, many kinds of scissors, clippers and creams that activated the verbs of abridgement and excision.  She studied her fingers and toes.  There was a way in which she isolated a digit for sharp regard, using a magnifier and a square of dark cardboard, and there were hangnails flying and shreds and grains of dead skin and fragments of nail, scintillas, springing in the air.
It was good to be doing this again.” (DeLillo 76)

imagined scene of Mr. Tuttle’s relative’s appearance (DeLillo 78-79):  “Everything seemed believable, even the lost dog return, and the thing about the scene is that it never reached the point of does she turn him in, does she give him up, but just ended, abruptly, like this.” (DeLillo 80) — both calls attention to the scene as performance but also the sentence itself as a performative

“...she found herself describing the scene, mentally, to someone who may have been Mariella, or not, as if he were a piece of found art and they needed, between them, to settle the question of his usability.” (DeLillo 81)

“She wax-stripped hair from her armpits and legs.  It came ripping off in cold sizzles.  She had an acid exfoliating cream, hard-core, prescribed, and after she stripped the hair she rubbed in the cream to remove wastepapery skin in flakes and scales and little rolling boluses that she liked to hold between her fingers and imagine, unmorbidly, as the cell death of something inside her.
She used a monkey-hair brush on her elbows and knees.  She wanted it to hurt.
She didn’t have to go to Tangier to buy loofahs and orange sticks.  It was all in the malls, in the high aisles, and so were the facial brushes, razors and oatmeal scrubs.  This was her work, to disappear from all her former venues of aspect and bearing and to become a blankness, a body slate erased of every past resemblance.
She had a fade cream she applied just about everywhere, to depigment herself.  She cut off some, then more of the hair on her head.  It was crude work that became nearly brutal when she bleached out the color.  In the mirror she wanted to see someone who is classically unseen, the person you are trained to look through, bled of every familiar effect, a spook in the night static of every public toilet.” (DeLillo 83-84)

“Do you recognize what you said weeks earlier, and yes, if it is recited back to you, and yes, if it is the last thing you said, among the last things, to someone you loved and would never see again.” (DeLillo 87)

“There’s something about the wind.  It strips you of assurances, working into you, continuous, making you feel the hidden thinness of everything around you, all the solid stuff of a hundred undertakings — the barest makeshift flimsy.” (DeLillo 93)

“Why did she think of calling mental hospitals in the first place, just after she’d discovered him?  He didn’t act crazy, only impaired in matters of articulation and comprehension.  Why did she ever think there was something psychotic about him except in the sense that people who threaten our assumptions are always believed to be mad?” (DeLillo 97)

Lauren’s regime:  “She was suppressing something, closing off outlets to the self...” (DeLillo 97)

“Something is happening.  It has happened.  It will happen.  This is what she believed.  There is a story, a flow of consciousness and possibility.  The future comes into being.” (DeLillo 98-99)

“Past, present and future are not amenities of language.  Time unfolds into the seams of being.  It passes through you, making and shaping./But not if you are him.” (DeLillo 99)

“He violates the limits of the human.” (DeLillo 100)

“Hartke’s work is not self-strutting or self-lacerating.  She is acting, always in the process of becoming another or exploring some root identity.” (DeLillo 105)

“‘The body has never been my enemy,’ she says.  ‘I’ve always felt smart in my body.  I taught it to do things other bodies could not.  It absorbs me in a disinterested way.  I try to analyze and redesign.’” (DeLillo 105)

“It is about who we are when we are not rehearsing who we are.” (DeLillo 110)

“The stories she told herself did not seem hers exactly.  She was in them so heedlessly they seemed to come from a deeper source, whatever that might mean, a thing that was overtaking her.  Where did they come from?  They did not come from the newspaper.  She hadn’t read a paper in some time.” (DeLillo 115)

“I am Lauren.  But less and less.” (DeLillo 117)

“Are you unable to imagine such a thing even when you see it?
Is the thing that’s happening so far outside experience that you’re forced to make excuses for it, or give it the petty credentials of some misperception?
Is reality too powerful for you?
Take the risk.  Believe what you see and hear.  It’s the pulse of every secret imtimation you’ve ever felt around the edges of your life.” (DeLillo 122)

“She walked into the room and went to the window.  She opened it.  She threw the window open.  She didn’t know why she did this.  Then she knew.  She wanted to feel the sea tang on her face and the flow of time in her body, to tell her who she was.” (DeLillo 124)
