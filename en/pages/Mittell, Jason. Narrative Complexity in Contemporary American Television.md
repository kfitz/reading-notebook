Mittell, Jason. “Narrative Complexity in Contemporary American Television.” The Velvet Light Trap 58 (Fall 2006): 29-40.


"a new form of entertainment television has emerged over the past two decades to both critical and popular acclaim. This model of television storytelling is distinct for its use of narrative complexity as an alternative to the conventional episodic and serial forms that have typified most American television since its inception." (Mittell 29)

"the purpose of this essay is to chart out the formal attributes of this storytelling mode, explore its unique pleasures and patterns of comprehension, and suggest a range of reasons for its emergence in the 1990s." (Mittell 29)

"In trying to understand the storytelling practices of contemporary American television, we might consider narrative complexity as a distinct narrational mode, as suggested by David Bordwell's analysis of film narrative. For Bordwell, a 'narrational mode is a historically distinct set of norms of narrational construction and comprehension,' one that crosses genres, specific creators, and artistic movements to forge a coherent category of practices." (Mittell 29, quoting Bordwell, _Narration in the Fiction Film_ 155)

"Television’s narrative complexity is predicated on specific facets of storytelling that seem uniquely suited to the series structure that sets television apart from film and distinguish it from conventional modes of episodic and serial forms." (Mittell 29)

"Obviously, the labels 'conventional' and 'complex' are not value-free descriptions, just as terms like 'primitive' and 'classical' signal evaluative standpoints in film studies." (Mittell 30)

"Television scholars have typically been reluctant to focus their analyses on the medium's narrative form, as television studies emerged from the twin paradigms of mass communications and cultural studies, both of which tend to foreground social impacts over aesthetic analysis, although using markedly different methodologies." (Mittell 30)

"a growing number of programs that work against the conventions of episodic and serial traditions in a range of intriguing ways. While some point to this emerging form as 'novelistic' television, I contend that it is unique to the television medium despite the clear influences from other forms such as novels, films, videogames, and comic books." (Mittell 30)

"a paradigm of historical poetics that situates formal developments within specific historical contexts  of production, circulation, and  reception. Following a historical poetic approach, innovations in media form are not viewed as creative breakthroughs of visionary artists but at the nexus of a number of historical forces that work to transform the norms established with any creative practice. Such an analysis examines the formal elements of any medium alongside the historical contexts that helped shape innovations and perpetuate particular norms." (Mittell 30)

"One key influence on the rise of narrative complexity on contemporary television is the changing perception of the medium's legitimacy and its appeal to creators.  Many of the innovative television programs of the past twenty years have come from creators who launched their careers in film, a medium with more traditional cultural cachet....  Part of the appeal is television's reputation as a producer's medium, where writers and creators retain control of their work more than in film's director-centered model." (Mittell 30-31)

"While innovative film narration has emerged as a 'boutique' form over the past years in the guise of puzzle films like _Memento_ and _Adaptation_, the norms of Hollywood still favor spectacle and formulas suitable for a peak opening weekend; comparatively, many narratively complex programs are among the medium's biggest hits, suggesting that the market for complexity may be more valued on television than in film." (Mittell 31)

"While many complex shows like _Firefly_, _Boomtown_, _Wonderfalls_, and early innovator _My So-Called Life_ were never granted time to establish a core audience, all of these short-lived programs have emerged on DVD, as their dedicated fandoms embrace the collectability of television in this new form, a trend that the media industries are eager to capitalize upon by creating programs with maximum 'rewatchability'." (Mittell 31)

"Since the mainstreaming of cable and the VCR in the early 1980s, the balance has shifted more toward viewer control -- the proliferation of channels has helped routinize repeats, so that viewers can catch up on a program in chronologically aired reruns or view missed premium cable shows multiple times throughout the week. Time-shifting technologies like VCRs and digital video recorders enable viewers to choose when they want to watch a program, but, more important for narrative construction, viewers can rewatch episodes or segments to parse out complex moments." (Mittell 31)

"Technological transformations away from the television screen have also impacted television narrative.  The internet's ubiquity has enabled fans to embrace a 'collective intelligence' for information, interpretations, and discussions of complex narratives that invite participatory engagement -- and in instances such as _Babylon 5_ or _Veronica Mars_, creators join in the discussions and use these forums as feedback mechanisms to test for comprehension and pleasures." (Mittell 31-32)

"Audiences tend to embrace complex programs in much more passionate and committed terms than most conventional television, using these shows as the basis for robust fan cultures and active feedback to the television industry (especially when their programs are in jeopardy of cancellation).  The rise of narrative complexity has also seen the rise in amateur television criticism, as sites like televisionwithoutpity.com have emerged to provide thoughtful and humorous commentaries on weekly episodes." (Mittell 32)

"So what exactly is narrative complexity?  At its most basic level, narrative complexity is a redefinition of episodic forms under the influence of serial narration -- not necessarily a complete merger of episodic and serial forms, but a shifting balance.  Rejecting the need for plot closure within every episode that typifies conventional episodic form, narrative complexity foregrounds ongoing stories across a range of genres.  Additionally, narrative complexity moves serial form outside of the generic assumptions tied to soap operas -- many (although certainly not all) complex programs tell stories serially while rejecting or downplaying the melodramatic style and primary focus on relationships over plots of soap operas, which also distances contemporary programs from the cultural connotations of the denigrated soap genre."  (Mittell 32)

"_The X-Files_ exemplifies what may be the hallmark of narrative complexity: an interplay between the demands of episodic and serial storytelling.... Although _The X-Files_ features an influential array of narrative innovations, the show's eventual creative and critical decline highlights one of the key tensions inherent in narrative complexity: balancing the competing demands and pleasures of episodic and serial norms.  According to many _X-Files_ viewers and critics, the show suffered from too great a disjunction between the overly complex and unsatisfyingly deferred mythology versus the detached independence of the monster-of-the-week episodes that might contradict the accrued knowledge of the conspiracy." (Mittell 33)

"But narrative complexity cannot simply be defined as prime-time episodic seriality; within the broader mode of complexity, many programs actively work against serial norms but also embrace narrative strategies to rebel against episodic conventionality." (Mittell 33)

"In conventional television narratives that feature A and B plots the two stories may offer thematic parallels or provide counterpoint to one another, but they rarely interact at the level of action.  Complexity, especially in comedies, works against these norms by altering the relationship between multiple plotlines, creating interweaving stories that often collide and coincide." (Mittell 34)

"The viewers of such complex comedies as _Seinfeld_ and _Arrested Development_ not only focus on the diegetic world offered by the sitcoms but also revel in the creative mechanics involved in the producers' abilities to pull off such complex plot structures, a mode of viewing Sconce labels as 'metareflexive' but that warrants more detailed consideration." (Mittell 35, quoting Sconce, "What If? Charting Television's New Textual Boundaries")

"narratively complex programs offer another mode of attractions: the narrative special effect.  These moments push the operational aesthetic to the foreground, calling attention to the constructed nature of the narration and asking us to marvel at how the writers pulled it off; often these instances forgo realism in exchange for a formally aware baroque quality in which we watch the process of narration as a machine rather than engaging in its diegesis." (Mittell 35)

"This is not the reflexive self-awareness of Tex Avery cartoons acknowledging their own construction or the technique of some modernist art films asking us to view their constructedness from an emotional distance; operational reflexivity invites us to care about the storyworld while simultaneously appreciating its construction." (Mittell 35)

"Narrative spectacle can be built into the core scenarios of programs as well -- _24_ is often heralded for its real-time narrative structure, which in narratological parlance equates story time and discourse time (excepting commercial breaks).  Even more interesting here is that it may be the only television series named for its storytelling technique, not in reference to its diegetic world (the number 24 refers to nothing notable in the storyworld) but rather to the number of hours (and episodes) needed to complete the story." (Mittell 36)

"Narratively complex programs also use a number of storytelling devices that, while not unique to this mode, are used with such frequency and regularity as to become more the norm than the exception.  Analepses, or alterations in chronology, are not uncommon in conventional television....  Similarly, conventional programs have often used dream or fantasy sequences....  Another device... is retelling the same story from multiple perspectives...  Voice-over narration is atypical in most television, but conventional programs... use it to set the emotional tone and provide expository transitions.  Yet all of these devices, which vary from the 'exceedingly obvious' mode of conventional television storytelling, typically maximize their obviousness by explicitly signaling them as differentiations from a norm... to highlight how the show is using unconventional conventions.
     In contemporary narratively complex shows such variations in storytelling strategies are more commonplace and signaled with much more subtlety or delay; these shows are constructed without fear of temporary confusion for viewers." (Mittell 36-37)
 
"In all of these programs the lack of explicit storytelling cues and signposts creates moments of disorientation, asking viewers to engage more actively to comprehend the story and rewarding regular viewers who have mastered each program's internal conventions of complex narration." (Mittell 37)

"This need for gaining competencies in decoding stories and diegetic worlds is particularly salient across a number of media at the moment." (Mittell 37)

"what seems to be a key goal across videogames, puzzle films, and narratively complex television series is the desire to be both actively engaged in the story and successfully surprised through storytelling manipulations.  This is the operational aesthetic at work -- we want to enjoy the machine's results while also marveling at how it works." (Mittell 38)

"as in any mystery-driven fiction, viewers want to be surprised and thwarted as well as satisfied with the internal logic of the story.  In processing such programs viewers find themselves both drawn into a compelling diegesis (as with all effective stories) and focused on the discursive processes of storytelling needed to achieve each show's complexity and mystery.  Thus these programs convert many viewers to amateur narratologists, noting usage and violations of conventions, chronicling chronologies, and highlighting both inconsistencies and continuities across episodes and even series." (Mittell 38)

"You cannot simply watch these programs as an unmediated window to a realistic storyworld into which you might escape; rather, narratively complex television demands that you pay attention to the window frames, asking you to reflect on how it provides partial access to the diegesis and how the panes of glass distort your vision of the unfolding action." (Mittell 38)

"A common underlying trend that manifests itself both in television narratives and many digital forms like videogames and web pages is a need for procedural literacy, a recognition on the part of consumers that any mode of expression follows particular protocols and that to fully engage with that form we must master its underlying procedures." (Mittell 39)
