"The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record" (Bush)

"The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it" (Bush)

"Mere compression, of course, is not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it" (Bush)

"the stenotype, that somewhat disconcerting device encountered usually at public meetings.  A girl strokes its keys languidly and looks about the room and sometimes at the speaker with a disquieting gaze" (Bush)

"Such machines will have enormous appetites.  One of them will take instructions and data from a whole roomful of girls armed with simple key board punches, and will deliver sheets of computed results every few minutes.  There will always be plenty of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people doing complicated things" (Bush)

"There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his syntheses are not likely to keep up with the current scheme" (Bush)

"The human mind does not work that way [in a rules-based trial-and-error fashion].  It operates by association.  With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.  It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory.  Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature. 
"Man cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be albe to learn from it.  In minor ways he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency" (Bush)

"Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, "memex" will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory" (Bush)

"This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing" (Bush)

"It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together from widely separated sources and bound together to form a new book. It is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails" (Bush)

"Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified" (Bush)

"There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record. The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected" (Bush)

"Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important" (Bush)
