"In one respect, the 'culture of the book' -- that is, a certain way of producing knowledge, meaning, and sociability -- is quite definitely fading a little further from view with every passing day.  From another perspective, the syndrome of textuality and its corollary, reading, is becoming omnipresent, and the myth of the universal library looks more than ever like a paradigm of knowledge." (Bazin 153)

"Books, the centuries-old foundation of textuality, can now be seen as overshadowed by a metatextuality that extends progressively to the whole complex of modes of representing the world, to all the different media, while continuing, nevertheless, to function as a referent.  It is for this reason that the difficulty of perfecting and framing the methods for leaving through 'pages' on screen witnesses both an effort to reconform the book as a nonbook, and at the same time the book's permanence." (Bazin 153)

"Let us be clear.  I am not claiming that books as concrete things are going down with all hands on deck.  On the contrary, they are going to proliferate for a long while yet, and one of the major problems that the librarian has to resolve, moreover, will be how to navigate in a hybrid space of documents, at once printed and digital.  But the book object *has* lost the central position it once occupied in the simultaneously cognitive, cultural, and political field which was built up around it and which we can describe using Roger Chartier's term as the 'order of the book.'" (Bazin 153)

"the book doubtlessly still has a bright future before it, since it has sufficiently demonstrated up to now its cognitive efficacy and robustness; but it happens to have been outstripped by a process of metareading that is becoming a new driving force of culture." (Bazin 154)

"what we will more and more have to reckon with will be less the *appropriation* of a text or even a work than the pursuit of a carefully formulated thematic across a composite 'space' of bodies of knowledge.  The library of the future will have to provide the tools for this navigation." (Bazin 158)

"The book thus derives its specific efficacy not so much from being a text but rather as a node of physical, economic, and legal forces that differentiate and diffuse the effect of the text." (Bazin 158) -- including separation of author and reader
