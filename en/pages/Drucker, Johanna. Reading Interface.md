interface is neither a thing nor a representation of real processes; it is instead a set of mediating structures that "signify by their graphical organization (they do not just display information “transferred” to us by reading). Our task is to understand how they organize our relation to complex systems (rather than how they represent them) and, maybe more important but less tangible, to understand how an interface works as a boundary space (though it masquerades as a reified image or menu of options)" (213)

"Our constitution as subjects is integral to use; we are in constant formation in relation to interface" (216)

"We don’t see the computer, any more than we rely on a picture of the world. We work with abstractions built on top of the computer’s capacities. The screen metaphors we have come to rely on have no analogy to the affordances engineered into the operating system. And they bear only a faint relation to the objects in the physical world that they mimic" (216)

"Textual and literary readers are sometimes disinclined to consider the graphical dimensions of texts. But just as the language of a work constrains its semantic field (however wild the interpretations provoked), so the graphical codes give initial rhetorical structure to the presentation of a work in any visually perceptible format" (217)

"In addition to dissecting the reading of interface, we must create theoretical frameworks for discussing reading as interface." (218)

"Interface, increasingly, will be the experience of being in the world." (219)
