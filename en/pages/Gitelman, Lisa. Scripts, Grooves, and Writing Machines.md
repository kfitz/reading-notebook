Introduction:  Writing Things Down, Storing Them Up

“This book is about machines for reading and writing in late-nineteenth-century  America” (Gitelman 1)

“isolating and centering machines in this way, to essentialize them as the phonograph or the computer, is misleading and denies their history” (Gitelman 1)

“My focus is on experiments and innovations in the area of inscription.  In the manner of German theorist Friedrich Kittler, I see mechanized inscription as integral (though certainly not unique) to the climate of representation that emerged toward the end of the nineteenth century and has dominated the twentieth.” (Gitelman 2)

many mechanical modes of inscription, “like the grooved surfaces of phonograph records, provoked explicit questions about textuality, about how some inscriptions might or might not be like texts” (Gitelman 3)

reads media theorists such as Kittler and Virilio as both romantic and deterministic in their approaches to technology, giving it a “symbolic character” (Gitelman 4)

“My discussion offers a less determined, less determinist version of technology, in part by locating writing machines and other textual devices in the instances of intervention, in narratives that show each machine, device, or process to have been authored and appropriated out of many different possibilities relevant to the making of meaning” (Gitelman 4)

new modes of inscription as “theories of language and textuality” (Gitelman 4)

the “forgetfulness” of technological development:  “As moderns and as consumers, we have been conditioned to think that technologies supersede each other one by one, the present ever liberating us from the past.” (Gitelman 6)

treating technology as rhetorical allows for critique of science:  “If technology is a form of knowledge, then it can be conflicted with doubt and contradiction, with assumptions and anxieties, just like other forms of knowledge…. Culture insinuates itself within technology at the same time that technology infiltrates culture.” (Gitelman 7)

social constructionist approach to technology:  “According to this view, an invention succeeds not because ‘it works,’ but rather it is described as ‘working’ because it succeeds amid prevailing and possibly competitive expectations.” (Gitelman 8)

“changes to writing and reading matter in large measure because they equal changes to writers and readers.  New inscriptions signal new subjectivities” (Gitelman 11)

on the history of the phonograph, which evolved as a tool of objectivity:  “How could the same instrument of rational, critical discourse become the object of passive consumption?  How could ‘consumption’ in cases like these become as passive as Habermas and the bleaker accounts of the Frankfurt School critics suggest?  Narratives about phonographs open questions like these, while they hint at just how deeply misserved the public is by assuming, as so readily happens today, that print and nonprint media are antithetical sources of meaning in the modern context.  Print culture and nonprint media evolve in mutual inextricability.” (Gitelman 13)
