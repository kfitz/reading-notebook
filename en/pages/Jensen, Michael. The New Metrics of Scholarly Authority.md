moving from era of information scarcity of information abundance; producing vast shift in how we determine authority and significance of scholarly material

"Scholarly authority is being influenced by many of the features that have collectively been dubbed Web 2.0 by Tim O'Reilly and others, and what I'll call Authority 2.0 in order to explore more fully the shifts that seem likely in the near future. While those trends are enabled by digital technology, I'm not concerned with technology per se -- I learned years ago that technology doesn't drive change as much as our cultural response to technology does." (Jensen)

Web 2.0 "encourages participation, what O'Reilly calls 'harnessing collective intelligence.'" (Jensen)

lessons derived from Web 2.0 ventures: "a general user impatience with any impediments, a fracturing of markets into micromarkets, and many other changes in entertainment and information- and education-gathering habits across multiple demographics" (Jensen)

the basis of "shamanic authority":  "specialized knowledge of available resources, and the skill to pursue those resources and use them. Hunting and gathering are expensive in terms of the energy they take, and require both skill and knowledge. The members of the tribe who are admired, and have authority, are those who are best at gathering, returning, and providing for the benefit of the tribe. That is an authority model based on scarcity."  (Jensen)

"right now we're still living with the habits of information scarcity because that's what we have had for hundreds of years. Scholarly communication before the Internet required the intermediation of publishers. The costliness of publishing became an invisible constraint that drove nearly all of our decisions. It became the scholar's job to be a selector and interpreter of difficult-to-find primary and secondary sources; it was the scholarly publisher's job to identify the best scholars with the best perspective and the best access to scarce resources." (Jensen)


"Before risking half a year's salary on a book, the publisher would go to great lengths to validate the scholarship (with peer review), and to confirm the likely market for the publication. We evolved immensely complex, self-referential mechanisms to make the most of scarce, expensive resources. Consequently, scholarly authority was conferred upon those works that were well published by a respected publisher." (Jensen)

"Fundamentally, scholarly authority was about exclusivity in a world of scarce resources." (Jensen)

Web 2.0 models of authority:  Google PageRank, Slashdot, digg, del.icio.us 

"The challenge for all those sites pertains to abundance: To scale up to hundreds of thousands or millions of users, they need to devise means for harvesting collective intelligence productively." (Jensen)

"Interestingly, in Wikipedia, most users seem to believe that the more edited an entry is (that is, the more touched and changed by many different people), the more authority it has. That kind of democratization of authority is nearly unique to wikis that are group edited, since not observation, but active participation in improvement, is the authority metric." (Jensen)

"all are different models for computed analysis of user-generated authority, many of which are based on algorithmic analysis of participatory engagement. The emphasis in such models is often not on finding scarce value, but on weeding abundance." (Jensen)

"Most technophile thinkers out there believe that Web 3.0 will be driven by artificial intelligences — automated computer-assisted systems that can make reasonable decisions on their own, to preselect, precluster, and prepare material based on established metrics, while also attending very closely to the user's individual actions, desires, and historic interests, and adapting to them." (Jensen)

modes of algorithmic filtration: National Academies' Search Builder and Reference Finder; Microsoft's PhotoSynth

"In the Web 3.0 world, we will also start seeing heavily computed reputation-and-authority metrics, based on many of the kinds of elements now used, as well as on elements that can be computed only in an information-rich, user-engaged environment." (Jensen)

elements that may go into computing "authority 3.0":
" - Prestige of the publisher (if any).
- Prestige of peer prereviewers (if any).
- Prestige of commenters and other participants.
- Percentage of a document quoted in other documents.
- Raw links to the document.
- Valued links, in which the values of the linker and all his or her other links are also considered.
- Obvious attention: discussions in blogspace, comments in posts, reclarification, and continued discussion.
- Nature of the language in comments: positive, negative, interconnective, expanded, clarified, reinterpreted.
- Quality of the context: What else is on the site that holds the document, and what's its authority status?
- Percentage of phrases that are valued by a disciplinary community.
- Quality of author's institutional affiliation(s).
- Significance of author's other work.
- Amount of author's participation in other valued projects, as commenter, editor, etc.
- Reference network: the significance rating of all the texts the author has touched, viewed, read.
- Length of time a document has existed.
- Inclusion of a document in lists of "best of," in syllabi, indexes, and other human-selected distillations.
- Types of tags assigned to it, the terms used, the authority of the taggers, the authority of the tagging system." (Jensen)

"What are the implications for the future of scholarly communications and scholarly authority? First, consider the preconditions for scholarly success in Authority 3.0. They include the digital availability of a text for indexing (but not necessarily individual access — see Google for examples of journals that are indexed, but not otherwise available); the digital availability of the full text for referencing, quoting, linking, tagging; and the existence of metadata of some kind that identifies the document, categorizes it, contextualizes it, summarizes it, and perhaps provides key phrases from it, while also allowing others to enrich it with their own comments, tags, and contextualizing elements. // In the very near future, if we're talking about a universe of hundreds of billions of documents, there will routinely be thousands, if not tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of documents that are very similar to any new document published on the Web. If you are writing a scholarly article about the trope of smallpox in Shakespearean drama, how do you ensure you'll be read? By competing in computability. // Encourage your friends and colleagues to link to your online document. Encourage online back-and-forth with interested readers. Encourage free access to much or all of your scholarly work. Record and digitally archive all your scholarly activities. Recognize others' works via links, quotes, and other online tips of the hat. Take advantage of institutional repositories, as well as open-access publishers. The list could go on." (Jensen)
 
"For universities, the challenge will be ensuring that scholars who are making more and more of their material available online will be fairly judged in hiring and promotion decisions. It will mean being open to the widening context in which scholarship is published, and it will mean that faculty members will have to take the time to learn about — and give credit for — the new authority metrics, instead of relying on scholarly publishers to establish the importance of material for them." (Jensen)

"Many of the values of scholarship are not well served yet by the Web: contemplation, abstract synthesis, construction of argument. Traditional models of authority will probably hold sway in the scholarly arena for 10 to 15 years, while we work out the ways in which scholarly engagement and significance can be measured in new kinds of participatory spaces."
