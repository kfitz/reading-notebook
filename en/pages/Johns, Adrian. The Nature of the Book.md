Johns, Adrian. The Nature of the Book: Print and Knowledge in the Making. Chicago: U Chicago Press, 1998.


### CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

Begins with our assumptions about the print object we hold; "That we can assume all these things of such an object -- that such an object actually exists -- derives from our living in what many people call 'print culture.'" (2)

"It is this very self-evidence that encourages us to ascribe all these characteristics to a technological order of reality. If called upon, we may assert that print texts are identical and reliable because that is simply what printing _is_... Yet this book argues that [this assumption] is substantially false. Not only that: _The Nature of the Book_ maintains that it is probably the most powerful force resisting the acceptance of a truly historical understanding of print and any cultural consequences it may foster." (2)

"This book contends that what we often regard as essential elements and necessary concomitants of print are in fact rather more contingent than generally acknowledged... the very identity of print itself had to be _made_. It came to be as we now experience it only by virtue of hard work, exercised over generations and across nations." (2) ++ Therefore, why would we assume that electronic textuality _is_ something in particular? ++

"for good or ill, countless authors and publishers have encountered to some degree the loss of control induced by piracy. It means that the experiences associated with print are indeed different from those familiar to most Western readers. And any suggestion that the intrinsic cultural consequences of technology have simply been inadequately realized in such settings would be difficult to endorse." (4)

"early modern printing was not joined by any obvious or necessary bond to enhanced fidelity, reliability, and truth. That bond had to be forged." (5)

of the variability of print in the early modern era: "What could one know in such a realm, and how could one know it?" (5) ++ Exactly the kind of question we ask today, and then blame our technologies for creating instability. ++

"If, on the other hand, it is not printing per se that possesses preservative power, but printing put to use in particular ways, then we ourselves may usefully draw some rather different distinctions. We may look not just for differences between print and manuscript reproduction, but for different ways in which the press itself and its products have been (and continue to be) employed. The roots of textual stability may be sought as much in these practices as in the press itself." (5)

re-reading of Tycho Brahe, who is used in Eisenstein as an exemplar of print culture's power

"The unifying concept of Eisenstein's argument is that of 'print culture.' This 'culture' is characterized primarily in terms of certain traits that print is taken to endow on texts. Specifically, those produced in such an environment are subject to conditions of _standardization_, _dissemination_, and _fixity_.... She focuses on this attribute of fixity as the most important corollary of the press, seeing it as central to most of the effects of print culture." (10)

On Brahe's disputes with other "scientists": "Disputes like these were affairs of honor, conducted through appropriate intermediaries and champions. Printed books were their vehicles. That was what they were _for_." (16) ++ For disputing knowledge, that is, rather than sealing it into fixity. ++

"If even Tycho Brahe found it so difficult to maintain his printed materials as mobile and immutable, what hope is there of explaining the achievements of less powerful figures in Eisenstein's terms? Attempting to do so would mean attributing to printed books themselves attributes of credibility and persuasion that actually took much work to maintain." (18)

Eisenstein establishes fixity as a quality of texts, not as a quality of the labor that goes into producing and disseminating texts; "Readers consequently suffer the fate of obliteration: their intelligence and skill is reattributed to the printed page." (19) ++ This is exactly the thing that is recurring in the shift to digital textuality: the efficacy of readers in their encounters with digital text is swept aside by the ostensible fluidity and unreliability of the texts themselves. ++

"There is an alternative. We may consider fixity not as an _inherent_ quality, but as a _transitive_ one.... We may adopt the principle that fixity exists only inasmuch as it is recognized and acted upon by people -- and not otherwise. The consequence of this change in perspective is that print culture itself is immediately laid open to analysis. It becomes a _result_ of manifold representations, practices and conflicts, rather than just the monolithic _cause_ with which we are often presented.... It recognizes that texts, printed or not, cannot compel readers to react in specific ways, but that they must be interpreted in cultural spaces the character of which helps to decide what counts as a proper reading. In short, this recasting has the advantage of positioning the cultural and the social where they should be: at the center of our attention." (19-20)

"A new historical understanding of print is needed. What will it look like? One immediately evident feature will be its regard for the labors of those actually involved in printing, publishing, and reading. Another will be its respect for their own representations of printing, embracing both its prospects and its dangers.... Perhaps we should remind ourselves of the extent to which those responses appeared to fail -- of the extent to which the print culture of the eighteenth century could be perceived by contemporaries, not as a realization of the rationalizing effects now so often ascribed to the press, but as destabilizing and threatening to civility." (28)

"what Roger Chartier calls the 'intellectual "labor"' required to put a book or paper to use... ways of reading are recognized as 'social and cultural practices.' Like other such practices, they have a history, and one that can be reconstructed... an apparently authoritative text, however 'fixed,' could not compel uniformity in the cultures of its reception." (29)

"no significant author seemed to escape the kinds of practices soon colloquially subsumed under the label of piracy. This meant that even when a book was not so treated, the possibility that it might be still permeated the negotiations, practices, and conventions by which it was made, distributed, exchanged, and used." (30)

focus in _The Nature of the Book_ on "how readers decided _what_ to believe.... Readers were not without resources for such an assessment. When they approached a given book, with them came knowledge about the purposes, status, and reliability of printed materials in general -- knowledge they used to determine the appropriate kind and degree of faith to vest in this unfamiliar object." (31)

"Readers worried about who decided what got into print, and about who controlled it once it was there." (32) ++ So like the present moment; concern that "anyone could publish anything." ++

"unauthorized printing threatened to 'unauthorize' authors themselves.... Like print itself, piracy therefore had _epistemic_ as well as _economic_ implications: it affected the structure and content of knowledge." (33)

"printers and booksellers themselves fought to create a trustworthy realm of printed knowledge by articulating such conventions [of propriety]. The civility they adopted was complex, but it was also highly consequential." (34)

"The sources of print culture are therefore to be sought in civility as much as in technology, and in historical labors as much as in immediate cause and effect." (35)

"Readers assigned credit to printed materials on the grounds of knowledge about their makers, which was in turn assessed partly in terms of printed sources already accredited." (36-37)

licensing and regulation of printing and bookselling not just used "to suppress texts of which the state disapproved" but must also consider "the central role contemporaries ascribed to such systems in the maintenance of any trust at all in the realm of print" (38)

on the local nature of knowledge, and the problematic notion of dissemination: "The evocation of an all-powerful central source from which influence spreads across an inert terrain is no longer tenable, because sites of reception previously supposed passive are now recognized to have been vital, dynamic, and appropriative. Notions of 'popularization' become equally problematic, since they too generally posit audiences as passive receptacles of influence rather than positive agents of appropriation." (43)

"If reading has a history, then assuming that modern readers' responses to a printed page accurately reproduce those of seventeenth-century men and women becomes problematic." (46)

"The achievements of the Royal Society were consequently but one element in a continuing history of attempts to discipline print and render it a sound platform for building a godly nation. That history included the development of vital and lasting new concepts of authorship, publication, and reading." (49)

%% Think about the relationship between the mechanisms of controlled authorization Johns attributes to Bacon and other early moderns working to establish print as a reliable substrate for knowledge and the Walter Lippman sense that similar modes of control in journalism were necessary in order to ensure that public opinion was shaped by a carefully selected elite. And then Siva's reading of Lippman vs Dewey (the private control of knowledge vs its debate in the public sphere).

"To assert originality while avoiding the taint of singularity became a central problem for writers in all fields." (52)

the role of the metropolis in the creation of knowledge: "The unprecedented expansion of London created a unique urban environment with powerful and assertive craft communities. Here, as the Restoration virtuosi always stressed, the creation of natural knowledge must be a collaborative enterprise. It must draw together not just gentlemen, but printers and booksellers too -- not to mention the critical readership thronging the coffeehouses." (56) ++ Raises the question: is the internet a new kind of urbanization? Are we encountering a similar need to develop knowledge in concert with (rather than in remove from) the communities that populate it? ++

### CHAPTER 2. LITERATORY LIFE: THE CULTURE AND CREDIBILITY OF THE PRINTED BOOK IN EARLY MODERN LONDON

Milton noted the ways that participants in the print culture of London "did not invest their faith indiscriminately in all printed materials. They 'tried' the works they met with, appraising them critically both against each other and against their own private knowledge" (58)

complicated relations within printers' houses; wide range of figures working there; includes discussion of odd blend of commercial and domestic life in printing houses

need to declare authorship tied both to the need to declare responsibility (and thus punishability) before the state and the need to eliminate piracy

exploration of wide range of practices considered under the category of piracy (mid-17th c?)

threats posed by importation of foreign books

"As an attributed quality, piracy was a label attached to an object by users, not one residing in the object itself... there was no way of discerning definitively from content alone whether or not a book was a piracy. Indeed piracy itself should be seen as one among a repertoire of categories being developed to help contemporaries think about and practically cope with the world of print. Print itself certainly did not guarantee the value of what it produced and reproduced. Rather, those making use of it needed to develop new tactics to construct and maintain their claims to truth." (174)

"Authors were certainly assigned what might now seem a low status.... The _Tatler_ hit the mark when it complained that the art of writing had become 'meerly Mechanick,' to be performed by the dogged application of constraining rules." (175) -- ergo, a "gentleman" could not be an author, as he must be "his own man": "What was regrettable about printing, then, was that it constrained a gentleman's defining freedom" (176)

"Gentlemen thus repudiated authorship not out of simple snobbery, nor from affected repugnance at 'the stigma of print,' but because the character of the Stationer impinged on fundamental elements of the genteel identity." (176)

women and authorship: "Conventionally, women were expected to cleave to a trinity of virtues: modesty, chastity, and silence. Aspersions cast on any one of those threw the other two into doubt.... Women daring to venture into print were thus taking substantial risks, and not only economic ones" (180); began to change dramatically in the mid-seventeenth century

"the central, overwhelming paradox rending early modern print culture[:] The only really effective way to guarantee the authenticity of their printed sheets was to abandon the defining element of print itself." (182)

"How the mob might interpret a work could therefore come to be of greater concern than any supposedly objective reading -- and even than the author's own intention." (185)

### CHAPTER 3. "THE ADVANCEMENT OF WHOLESOME KNOWLEDGE": THE POLITICS OF PRINT AND THE PRACTICES OF PROPRIETY

"The previous chapter asked what qualities combined to constitute a good character for a Stationer. This one shows how the entire craft community worked to sustain them for the book trade as a whole." (187)

"While the typographical certainty that modern historians all too readily attribute to early printing is a chimera, seventeenth-century readers settled for looser, practical criterial of trust - criteria that may have been much less absolute than that technological standard, but were far more realizable." (188)

"the Stationers' civility has often been mistaken, then and now, for bald rapacity. Far from creating and inhabiting an amoral class, however, printers and booksellers used elaborate mechanisms to deal with all the problems of piracy, and they prized these mechanisms for their role in securing their own credit. They thereby created a cultural regime capable of disciplining the domains of print." (188)

"In the Stationers' Company, conventions of propriety thus came to occupy a central place in the representation of the trade both to itself and to the country at large. In their articulation, the very identity of print was at stake." (189)

belief of the essential nature of regulating print: not simple repression; rather, "the reality of seventeenth-century law and administration was that it operated through the participation of householders involved in the particular activity under constraint" (189-90); unregulated print would be a dystopia

great detail of the structure and functioning of the Stationers' Company, its customs, hierarchy, etc.; the uses and abuses of the register

"In the court, ownership of a publication was routinely called 'propriety.' In the seventeenth century, the words _propriety_ and _property_ were virtual synonyms, of course, and they share an etymology from the Latin _proprius_. Nonetheless, the usage reminds us that in the Stationers' community offenses against the property enshrined by convention in the register were seen simultaneously as offenses against proper conduct." (222)

difficulties for derivative works such as translations, exegeses, etc

"What linked the Company's procedures immediately to wider mechanisms of political governance was the licensing system. This was the regime under which Stationers had to submit any text they wished to publish to be read and approved beforehand by one of a small number of authorized officials." (230)

chaos resulting from periodic lapses of regulatory laws

"What has retrospectively been labeled the 'Copyright Act' of 1710 was in effect a qualified response to the Stationers' pleas for the protection hitherto provided under the licensing regime. And as that implies, the angelic renown of the former is perhaps as exaggerated as the demonic reputation of the latter." (234)

"Certainly, the licenser did not in practice enjoy a position of unqualified power over the booksellers, printers, informers, writers, and readers with whom he had to deal. On the contrary, to be a successful licenser involved creating and maintaining a fragile cooperative alliance with all of these parties." (240)

"By the mid-seventeenth century, then, the state and the Stationers in concert had evolved a complex set of procedures for the establishment and regulation of propriety. Their focus was the register.... Amid a print culture characterized by ephemerality, transience, and discredit, _here_, Stationers indicated, could be found the embodiment of printing as a reliably self-regulating craft." (246)

"Lockean philosophy could thus be used to bolster claims to an inviolable, perpetual property in authorial works, and patents for inventions suggested protection for a limited time; but as Condorcet and Diderot were debating in France at the same time, Enlightenment principles could also lead one to question whether literary property were conceivable at all.... Adam Smith would eventually define the first purpose of government as being 'to prevent the members of a society from incroaching on one another's property,' and name copyright as one of the only two kinds of monopolies to be justifiable in this context. But he could do so largely because it remained so fragile - both in fact and in theory." (247-48)

Licensing as "a machinery for producing credit"; "Defenders accordingly maintained that the point of licensing was not simply to suppress works. it also guaranteed the epistemic and commercial probity of the very printed sheets to which an imprimatur _was_ fixed." (263)

### CHAPTER 4: JOHN STREATER AND THE KNIGHTS OF THE GALAXY: REPUBLICANISM, NATURAL KNOWLEDGE, AND THE POLITICS OF PRINTING

"Authorship and authority alike are better seen as _attributions to_ a book (by Stationers, readers, legal inquisitors, and others) than as _attributes of_ a book. They were matters of cultural practice and negotiation. Since they were not intrinsic, they could be challenged." (271)

### CHAPTER 5: FAUST AND THE PIRATES: THE CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE PRINTING REVOLUTION

“The ‘printing revolution’ as we now know it is thus the product of a later, political revolution. It was a retrospective creation, forged with tools selectively chosen from the arguments created by eighteenth-century historians of the press for other purposes…. The ideology (as we may call it) of a printing revolution was thus not only a result of the French Revolution; it was perceived as a necessary one in order to render that revolution both permanent and universal.” (374)

“The printing revolution and the scientific revolution have remarkably similar pedigrees. Both are creations characteristic of the modern age, retrospectively identifying moments of transformation into modernity in the Renaissance and early modern periods. Both may be traced back to the Enlightenment, but both solidified only in the mid-nineteenth century.” (378)

turn in the following chapter to the history of reading: “If books were to be made into useful tools for creating and sustaining knowledge, they realized, then the act of reading would itself need to be understood… Reading might indeed facilitate the creation of a new philosophy, they concluded, but only if conducted appropriately. Otherwise it was at least as likely to generate error and injury, both to the reader’s own body and, by extension, to the body politic of the state.” (379)

### CHAPTER 6: THE PHYSIOLOGY OF READING: PRINT AND THE PASSIONS

“if one wished to retain reliability and independence of mind, then one must be careful what, and how, one read.” (382)

“the powerful effects of reading to which [Boyle] fell victim were not only widely attested, but supported by contemporary knowledge about human beings and the physical world they inhabited. In consequence, accounts of the practical experience of reading came to play a central role in arguments about the status of claims to knowledge, especially when such claims came to be controverted.” (384)

“The history of reading aims to trace and account for such dynamic processes, by appreciating the different practices by which readers in various times and places attribute meansings to the objects of their reading. It explains the global by rigorous attention to the local.” (385)

“What is it that passes from page to mind when someone reads, and how does it have an effect? This is the fundamental question with which the analysis presented here begins.” (386)

“Human beings perceived letters on a page through the mediation of their bodies; the passions were the emotional, physiological, and moral responses of the human body to its surroundings, and thus played an unavoidable role in the reading process.” (386)

“Physicians, Willis among them, became as accustomed to treating the symptoms of improper or excessive reading as those of the passions. They found that excessive reading could bring on a vast range of conditions. Many of them were experienced disproportionately by women, as could be explained readily enough in terms of the heightened sensitivity regularly attributed to the female body.” (408)

“concepts of the passionate character of reading, and of the proper self-management that they demanded, were central to the experiences and arguments of both ‘enthusiasts’ and their enemies” (409)

“Since humans were intrinsically passionate, knowledge must be produced collectively. This was, of course, exemplified by the practice of the Royal Society. To a substantial degree, the Society’s great virtue was that in creating a disciplined, polite, and above all *collective* judgment it went as far as humanly possible to eliminate passionate error.” (433)

### CHAPTER 7: PIRACY AND USURPATION: NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN THE RESTORATION

“the economic justification of learned publishing was always fragile” (445)

“Philosophical writers vested much of their identities and reputations in their printed works, so that counterfeiting, abridgment, translation, and piracy threatened them with far more than merely economic damage. The repute of the individual concerned — and of the knowledge he or she professed — rested on the successful negotiation of such hazards. Writers developed certain strategies to overcome these dangers. They might coalesce and cooperate as a group, for example, combining resources to protect themselves. Such a body might even become a corporate licenser, utilizing the conventions described in chapter 3 to distinguish its books as creditable. Another possible course was to invent new techniques of communication, such as the learned periodical, the protocols of which might limit the practical powers of printers and booksellers. Still another was to police not just publication but reading, in the hope of stimulating debate while limiting conflict.” (445)

“Expensive production costs, long printing schedules (with the attendant risks of interruption), and limited markets meant that Stationers were notoriously reluctant to undertake learned titles unless they could be guaranteed to sell.” (449)

“Some writers took advantage of this tendency to spread unorthodox views, or to achieve authorship without appearing to aspire to it. Isaac Newton was one: he repeatedly considered promoting his deeply felt heterodoxy by using distant intermediaries to publish texts that could question conventional shibboleths by virtue of appearing to be unauthorized.” (460)

responses to concerns about piracy, plagiarism, and usurpation in learned publishing: “Attempts to develop printing technologies, however, were really secondary to those that concentrated on the proper place and social management of printing, publication, distribution, and reading. Subscription projects, with their gentlemen referees, offered one means of ensuring the safe production of substantial learned texts.” (463)

“Restoration natural philosophers created both new forms of sociability and new genres of writing. The experimental paper, the philosophical journal, the book review, the editor, and the experimental author were all original creations. They may plausibly be seen as mechanisms for making and protecting the credit of documentary evidence when that credit was otherwise insecure…. These were much more than merely rhetorical concepts. They need to be appreciated in terms of practical responses to problems permeating the very character and use of printed reports. Above all, however, solutions to those problems envisaged that a place must be found in which authorship and reading could become safeguarded activities and where these new conventions could be formulated and applied. This meant providing a location where the accepted conventions of polite society would be visibly and reliably observed at all times. In 1660 such a place was invented. Two years later it received its charter as the Royal Society.” (464-65)

“It has long been recognized that central to the Society’s success (such as it was) was its publishing record — a record encompassing not just the first ‘scientific’ journal, the _Philosophical Transactions_, but the invention of the experimental paper, and above all the successful production of Newton’s _Principia_. Whatever their specific methodological approaches, histories of science dealing with this period always cite these achievements as occurring against an assumed background of an ordered, epistemologically neutral print culture, which provided no serious resistance to the virtuosi’s efforts. Such an environment, needless to say, did not exist. The Society had to work to create it.” (466)

“why communication was so important to the Society in the first place” (467)

“The exclusion of the impolite and the rejection of the impolitic were to be indistinguishable.” (468)

“Experimental philosophy was to be a conversational practice. That is, an experiment succeeded not just if its procedures and results were agreed upon — itself a collective decision — but if it led interestingly to further conversation, and thence to further experiments.” (470)

“The validity of the matters of fact produced in the Society had to be recognized by much wider and more diverse audiences — including both rival academies, in cities like Paris, and philosophers accustomed to very different methods and conventions, such as the Jesuits and the court philosophers scattered across Europe…. The need to communicate successfully was therefore as important a part of the experimental philosophy as the experimenting itself. And what had to be communicated was not just a simple fact itself, but the entire adjudicatory and legitimating framework in which it had come into existence.” (472)

“In determining what credit to accord to a given work… attention came to center on the processes through which the manuscript was transformed into a publish text.” (475)

Society’s “right to license books”; Society’s council “ruled that no book be granted a license unless vetted by at least two of the council members, to ensure that ‘such book contains nothing but what is suitable to the design and work of the Society’.” (493-94)

Oldenburg’s _Philosophical Transactions_ “offered a regular vehicle for the publication of perused papers and the preservation of authorship… an attempt to extend the Society’s register into the rather different ‘public’ realm of print” (499)

“Since the Royal Society’s perceived identity to a large extent rested on these protocols, it is worth noting that even the accounts of its own origins that have come down to us were first constructed out of such resources and in response to these disputes…. One of the major consequences of the Society’s invention of propriety was thus the creation of its own history.” (503-504)

### CHAPTER 8: HISTORIES OF THE HEAVENS: JOHN FLAMSTEED, ISAAC NEWTON, AND THE HISTORIA CŒLESTIS BRITANNICA

“The whole conflict between Newton and Flamsteed was not only _about_ a book; it was also mediated by books. At every stage, books acted as the vehicles, triggers, occasions, weapons, propaganda, and result of the battle.” (621)

### CHAPTER 9: CONCLUSION

“Those who made and used books in early modern England labored as they did so to produce strategies for resolving their problems of credit…. Hitherto, historians have rather taken at face value the persuasive power of printed materials to affect the perceptions and actions of their readers; _The Nature of the Book_ has conceded that this power came to exist, but has seen it as a hard-won and brittle achievement.” (623)

“The history of the book is consequential because it addresses the conditions in which knowledge has been made and utilized.” (623)

“Printed pages were not intrinsically trustworthy, not least because a certain creativity was essential to the Stationer’s craft…. The recognition of printed books as reliable thus depended substantially on prior representations of the Stationers’ community as well ordered. Fixity depended on civility.” (624)

“That modern writers have been able to refer to the press’s ability to impose a ‘logic’ of cultural behavior is, in fact, a consequence of its very inability to do so: proponents had to propagandize extensively in such terms to establish fixity as plausible. By ignoring the reasons for their statemetns, we risk taking for a technological fact what was really a hard-won cultural artifact.” (625)

“reading is a complex skill with a complex history. It is not easily disciplined by texts. But that does not mean that it is free from all discpline whatsoever.” (632)
