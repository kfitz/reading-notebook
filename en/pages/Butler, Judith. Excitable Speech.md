Introduction:  On Linguistic Vulnerability.

what does it mean to say one has been injured by language? -- demonstrates that we are linguistic beings

"Does the power of language to injure follow from its interpellative power?" (2)

Austin, How to Do Things with Words:  "Austin distinguishes 'illocutionary' from 'perlocutionary' speech acts:  the former are speech acts that, in saying do what they say, and do it in the moment of that saying; the latter are speech acts that produce certain effects as their consequence; by saying something, a certain effect follows." (3)

illocutionary acts as ritual or ceremonial, and thus diachronic or iterable

physical nature of wounds inflicted by words indicates ties between language and the body:  "Language sustains the body not by bringing it into being or feeding it in a literal way; rather, it is by being interpellated within the terms of language that a certain social existence of the body first becomes possible....  We may think that to be addressed one must first be recognized, but here the Althusserian reversal of Hegel seems appropriate:  the address constitutes a being within the possible circuit of recognition and, accordingly, outside of it, in abjection." (5)

Elaine Scarry on the relationship between language and pain:  "One of the injurious consequences of torture, in her view, is that the one tortured loses the ability to document in language the event of torture; thus, one of the effects of torture is to efface its own witness." (6)

agency of language v. agency of the subject

Shoshana Felman:  "the body is the blindspot of speech, that which acts in excess of what is said, but which also acts in and through what is said. That the speech act is a bodily act means that the act is redoubled in the moment of speech:  there is what is said, and then there is a kind of saying that the bodily 'instrument' of the utterance performs." (11)

circumstances required for a threat to work

"To decide the matter of what is a threat or, indeed, what is a word that wounds, no simple inspection of words will suffice." (13); some power to wound inheres in certain words, given their histories; some power inheres in circumstances and contexts -- however, "Neither view can account for the restaging and resignifying of offensive utterance, deployments of linguistic power that seek at once to expose and counter the offensive exercise of speech." (13)

"The arguments in favor of a counter-appropriation or restaging of offensive speech are clearly undercut by the position that the offensive effect of the speech act is necessarily linked to the speech act, its originating or enduring context or, indeed, its animating intentions or original deployments...this suggests that the changeable power of such terms marks a kind of discursive performativity that is not a discrete series of speech acts, but a ritual chain of resignifications whose origin and end remain unfixed and unfixable." (14)

"For the threat, for instance, to have a future it never intended, for it to be returned to its speaker in a different form, and defused through that return, the meanings the spec act acquires and the effects it performs must exceed those by which it was intended, and the contexts it assumes must not be quite the same as the ones in which it originates (if such an origin is to be found)." (14-15)

"the gap that separates the speech act from its future effects has its auspicious implications:  it begins a theory of linguistic agency that provides an alternative tot he relentless search for legal remedy." (15)

but this is not a restoration of sovereign individual agency; but rather a new kind of agency:  "Untethering the speech act from the sovereign subject founds an alternative notion of agency and, ultimately, of responsibility, one that more fully acknowledges the way in which the subject is constituted in language, how what it creates is also what it derives from elsewhere." (15-16)

this undermining of sovereignty is not a demolishing of agency; "I propose that agency begins where sovereignty wanes." (16)

"Not all utterances that have the form of the performative, whether illocutionary or perlocutionary, actually work.  This insight has important consequences for the consideration of the putative efficacy of hate speech." (16)

failed performatives are still acts, even though they have little or no effect

perlocutionary acts produce consequences, "but the saying and the consequences are temporally distinct" (17); some such consequences may be unintentional, including the injury from an unintended insult

treatment of pornography and hate speech as illocutionary/perlocutionary by Catharine MacKinnon and Mari Matsuda

Butler questions "the presumption that hate speech always works, not to minimize the pain that is suffered as a consequence of hate speech, but to leave open the possibility that its failure is the condition of a critical response." (19)

"Even if hate speech works to constitute a subject through discursive means, is that constitution necessarily final and effective?  Is there a possibility of disrupting and subverting the effects produced by such speech, a faultline exposed that leads to the undoing of this process of discursive constitution?" (19)

"As an invocation, hate speech is an act that recalls prior acts, requiring a future repetition to endure.  Is there a repetition that might disjoin the speech act from its supporting conventions such that its repetition confounds rather than consolidates its injurious efficacy?" (20)

"Broadly considered arguments in favor of the collapse of the speech/conduct distinction tend to strengthen the case for state regulation and to suspend reference to the first Amendment.  Arguments that insist that speech acts are speech rather than conduct, on the other hand, tend to work in favor of suspending state intervention." (20)

the kinds of protection against hate speech enacted in anti-racist and anti-sexist rulings in fact pose a threat to the gay and lesbian political movement, closing down the possibility of graphic self-representation (see Mapplethorpe), explicit self-declaration (see coming out), and explicit sexual education (see ACT-up)

such protections run the risk of being turned against the very movements they protect, restricting freedoms and extending state power

interpellative function of hate speech

Althusser:  ritual form of ideology; ideas do not precede actions, but are formed in them

"one of the strongest arguments in favor of the state regulation of hate speech is that certain kinds of utterances, when delivered by those in positions of power against those who are already subordinated, have the effect of resubordinating those to whom such utterances are addressed." (26)

"It is therefore impossible to regulate fully the potentially injurious effect of language without destroying something fundamental about language and, more specifically, about the subject's constitution in language.  On the other hand, a critical perspective on the kinds of language that govern the regulation and constitution of subjects becomes all the more imperative once we realize how inevitable is our dependency on the ways we are addressed in order to exercise any agency at all." (27)

that we do not originate the terms of hate speech (but rather only repeat them) does not relieve our responsibility:  "The one who utters hate speech is responsible for the manner in which such speech is repeated, for reinvigorating such speech, for reestablishing contexts of hate and injury." (27)

ethical questions surrounding use of speech presuppose prior questions:  "who are 'we' such that without language we cannot be, and what does it mean 'to be' within language?  How is it that injurious language strikes at this very condition of possibility, of linguistic persistence and survival?" (28)

"That linguistic domain over which the subject has no control becomes the condition of possibility for whatever domain of control is exercised by the speaking subject.  Autonomy in speech, to the extent that it exists, is conditioned by a radical and originary dependency on a language whose historicity exceeds in all directions the history of the speaking subject.  And this excessive historicity and structure makes possible that subject's linguistic survival as well as, potentially, that subject's linguistic death." (28)

power of names:  "what if one were to compile all the names that one has ever been called?  Would they not present a quandary for identity?  Would some of them cancel the effect of others?  Would one find oneself fundamentally dependent upon a competing array of names to derive a sense of oneself?  Would one find oneself alienated in language, finding oneself, as it were, in the names addressed from elsewhere?" (30)

interpellation can take place without a hailing voice, and without the knowledge of the subject hailed

Foucault:  power does not take the form of a name, but "power is the name that one attributes to this complexity, a name that substitutes for that complexity, a name that renders manageable what might otherwise be too unwieldy or complex, and what, in its complexity, might defy the limiting and substantializing ontology presupposed by the name" (35)

"If we understand the force of the name to be an effect of its historicity, then that force is not the mere causal effect of an inflicted blow, but works in part through an encoded memory or a trauma, one that lives in language and is carried on in language." (36)

"Can repetition be both the way that trauma is repeated but also the way in which it breaks with the historicity to which it is in thrall?  What makes for a reverse citation in the scene of trauma, how can hate speech be cited against itself?" (37)

"If agency is not derived from the sovereignty of the speaker, then the force of the speech act is not sovereign force." (39)

"The legal effort to curb injurious speech tends to isolate the 'speaker' as the culpable agent, as if the speaker were at the origin of such speech.  The responsibility of the speaker is thus misconstrued.  The speaker assumes responsibility precisely through the citational character of speech." (39)

"In the current U.S. political climate, the law that decides the question of hate speech tends to be applied inconsistently in order to further reactionary political aims..." (39)

"As much as this text seeks to understand the particulars of recent arguments concerning hate speech, it also seeks to outline a more general theory of the performativity of political discourse." (40)

"Misappropriating the force of injurious language to counter its injurious operations constitutes a strategy that resists the solution of state-sponsored censorship, on the one hand, and the return to an impossible notion of the sovereign freedom of the individual, on the other." (41)

1.  Burning Acts, Injurious Speech

question of performativity is "bound up with a question of transitivity.  What does it mean for a word not only to name, but also in some sense to perform and, in particular, to perform what it names?" (43)

Austin's distinction between illocutionary and perlocutionary is "tricky, and not always stable" (44)

"It seems here that the meaning of a performative act is to be found in this apparent coincidence of signifying and enacting. // And yet it seems that this 'act-like' quality of the performative is itself an achievement of a different order, and that de Man was clearly on to something when he asked whether a trope is not animated at the moment when we claim that language 'acts,' that language posits itself in a series of distinct acts, and that its primary function might be understood as this kind of periodic acting." (44-45)

"For Nietzsche, the subject appears only as a consequence of a demand for accountability..." (46)

"The subject as sovereign is presumed in the Austinian account of performativity:  the figure for the one who speaks and, in speaking performs what she/he speaks, as the judge or some other representative of the law." (48-49)

"is it the utterance or the utterer who is the cause of the injury, or does that utterance perform its injury through a transitivity that cannot be reduced to a causal or intentional process originating in a singular subject? // Indeed, is iterability or citationality not precisely this:  the operation of that metalepsis by which the subject who 'cites' the performative is temporarily produced as the belated and fictive origin of the performative itself?" (49)

2.  Sovereign Performatives

"I propose to review some of the senses in which 'verbal conduct' is thought in the proposed hate speech regulation, and to offer an alternative view of how one might at once affirm that language does act, even injuriously, while insisting that it does not directly or causatively 'act on' the addressee in quite the way that proponents of hate speech legislation tend to describe.  Indeed, the act-like character of certain offensive utterances may be precisely what keeps them from saying what they mean to say or doing what it is they say." (72)

"Does the figure of the sovereign performative compensate for a lost sense of power, and how  might that loss become the condition for a revised sense of the performative?" (74)

"Figuring hate speech as an exercise of sovereign power implicitly performs a catachresis by which the one who is charged with breaking the law (the one who utters hate speech) is nevertheless invested with the sovereign power of the law.  What the law says, it does, but so, too, the speaker of hate.  The performative power of hate speech is figured as the performative power of state-sanctioned legal language, and the contest between hate speech and the law becomes staged, paradoxically, as a battle between two sovereign powers." (81)

"This idealization of the speech act as sovereign action (whether positive or negative) appears linked with the idealization of sovereign state power or, rather, with the imagined and forceful voice of that power.  It is as if the proper power of the state has been expropriated, delegated to its citizens, and the state then reemerges as a neutral instrument to which we seek recourse to protect us from other citizens who have become revived emblems of a (lost) sovereign power." (82)

Catharine MacKinnon, pornography, and Anita Hill

"performative contradiction:  an act of speech that in its very acting produces a meaning that undercuts the one it purports to make." (84)

"Presupposed by this conception of the utterance is a normative view of a person with the ability and power to exercise speech in a straightforward way..." (84)

"if one always risks meaning something other than what one thinks one utters, then one is, as it were, vulnerable in a specifically linguistic sense to a social life of language that exceeds the purview of the subject who speaks." (87)

claims of universality -- that only universalist speech should be protected -- can wind up feeding racism

"In this sense, being able to utter the performative contradiction is hardly a self-defeating enterprise; on the contrary, performative contradiction is crucial to the continuing revision and elaboration of historical standards of universality proper to the futural movement of democracy itself." (89-90)

liberal assumptions that "political participation requires the ability not only to represent one's intention in speech but to actualize one's intention through the act of speech. // The problem is not simply that, from a theoretical point of view, it makes no sense to assume that intentions are always properly materialized in utterances, and utterances materialized in deeds, but that the insight into those sometimes disjunctive relations constitutes an alternative view of the linguistic field of politics." (92)

"contemporary forms of political agency, especially those unauthorized by prior conventions or by reigning prerogatives of citizenship, tend to derive political agency from the failures in the performative apparatus of power, turning the universal against itself, redeploying equality against its existing formulation, retrieving freedom from its contemporary conservative valence." (93)

"the speech act is always delivered twice-removed, that is, through a theory of the speech act that has its own performative power (and that is, by definition, in the business of producing speech acts, thus redoubling the performativity it seeks to analyze)." (96)

" 'hate speech' is not deemed hateful or discriminatory until the courts decide that it is....  In this sense, it is the decision of the state, the sanctioned utterance of the state, which produces the act of hate speech -- produces, but does not cause." (96)

"although the law, however reactionary its formation, is understood as a resignifying practice, hate speech, however reactionary its formation, is not deemed to be susceptible to a significant resignification in the same way." (98-99)

aesthetic uses of injurious words may both use and mention those words, both citing their histories and disrupting those histories; "I do not mean to subscribe to a simple opposition between the aesthetic and juridical domains, for what is at stake in many of these controversies is precisely the power of the state to define what will count as aesthetic representation." (101)

3.  Contagious Word:  Paranoia and "Homosexuality" in the Military

themilitary as "a zone of partial citizenship, a domain in which selected features of citizenship are preserved, and others are suspended." (103)

discourse on homosexuality has increased rather than decreased as a result of the circumscription of the word

"homosexual" comes to define a group of people who are denied self-definition

"In what follows, I hope to show that the regulation describes as performative the self-ascription of homosexuality, doing precisely that which it says.  In describing the power of such acts of utterance, the regulations produce such utterances for us, exercising a performativity that remains the tacit and enabling condition for the delineation of 'I am a homosexual' as a performative utterance.  Only within that regulatory discourse is the performative power of homosexual self-ascription performatively produced." (107)

how is this regulatory performativity to be differentiated from the performativity embraced by the gay rights movement?

"Over and against the commonly stated worry that if homosexuality has no referent, there can be no effective gay and lesbian politics, I would suggest that the absence of a final referent for the term keeps the term from ever being quite as performative as the military imagines that it is.  The term gestures toward a referent it cannot capture.  Moreover, that lack of capture constitutes the linguistic possibility of a radical democratic contestation, one that opens the term to future rearticulations." (108)

Freud on the relationship between homosexuality and citizenship; homosexuality and paranoia; homosexuality and contagion

"it is crucial to consider that the military does not merely confront the homosexual as a problem to be regulated and contained, but it actively produces this figure of the homosexual, insisting that this homosexual be deprived of the power of self-ascription, remaining named and animated by the state and its powers of interpellation... thus, the state seeks to curb not merely homosexual actions, but the excessive power of the name when it becomes unshackled from the prohibitions by which it is spawned." (121-22)

produces "as state-sanctioned figure, a restrictive definition of homosexuality as an assaultive and contagious action." (122)

performativity of such figuring of the performative nature of homosexuality

"Whereas the discursive apparatus of homosexuality constitutes its social reality, it does not constitute it fully.  The declaration that 'coming out' is certainly a kind of act, but it does not fully constitute the referent to which it refers; indeed, it renders homosexuality discursive, but it does not render discourse referential." (125)

"one of the tasks of a critical production of alternative homosexualities will be to disjoin homosexuality from the figures by which it is conveyed in dominant discourse, especially when they take the form of either assault or disease." (125)

4.  Implicit Censorship and Discursive Agency

"To claim that certain speech is not speech and, therefore, not subject to censorship is already to have exercised the censor." (128)

"If censorship, however, is a way of producing speech, constraining in advance what will and will not become acceptable speech, then it cannot be understood exclusively in terms of juridical power." (128)

censorship as "productive":  "By 'productive' I do not mean positive or beneficial, but rather, a view of power as formative and constitutive, that is, not conceived exclusively as an external exertion of control or as the deprivation of liberties.  According to this view, censorship is not merely restrictive and privative, that is, active in depriving subjects of the freedom to express themselves in certain ways, but also formative of subjects and the legitimate boundaries of speech." (132)

role of censorship in official legibility; role of "foreclosure" in subject formation

Bourdieu and the habitus; fails to consider the ways that the bodily in speech confounds the norms by which it is regulated

in academic discourse, the capacity of terms "to acquire non-ordinary meanings constitutes their continuing political promise" (145)

Bourdieu and Derrida on Austin:  both attempt "to delineate more clearly the 'force' of the performative utterance, of what gives a linguistic utterance the force to do what it says, or to facilitate a set of effects as a result of what it says." (145-46)

"The thinness of [Austin's] 'theory' of social context is criticized by Bourdieu precisely because it presumes without elaborating an account of the power of social institutions, including but not limited to language itself." (146)

Bourdieu's theory "fails to recognize that a certain performative force results from the rehearsal of the conventional formulae in non-conventional ways....  In making social institutions static, Bourdieu fails to grasp the logic of iterability that governs the possibility of social transformation." (147)

Derrida, by contrast, focuses on iterability:  "For Derrida, the force of the performative is derived precisely from its decontextualization, from its break with a prior context and its capacity to assume new contexts." (147)

"Whereas Bourdieu fails to take account of the way in which a performative can break with existing context and assume new contexts, refiguring the terms of legitimate utterance themselves, Derrida appears to install the break as a structurally necessary feature of every utterance and every codifiable written mark, thus paralyzing the social analysis of forceful utterance." (150)

speech acts as bodily acts:  "That speech is not the same as writing seems clear, not because the body is present in speech in a way that it is not in writing, but because the oblique relation of the body to speech is itself performed by the utterance, deflected yet carried by the performance itself." (152)

Bourdieu's habitus:  "refers to those embodied rituals of everydayness by which a given culture produces and sustains belief in its own 'obviousness'." (152)

"To what extent is the habitus structured by a kind of performativity...?" (153)

"The social life of the body is produced through an interpellation that is at once linguistic and productive." (153) -- thus calling into question the distinction between the social and the linguistic

potential for "derailment" in the interpellation of the body:  "Bodies are formed by social norms, but the process of that formation runs its risk." (156)

"The performative needs to be rethought not only as an act that an official language-user wields in order to implement already authorized effects, but precisely as social ritual..." (159)

"The performative is not only a ritual practice:  it is one of the influential rituals by which subjects are formed and reformulated." (160)

reclamation of the terms of modernity to new, more fully democratizing politics, including "universality," "freedom," "equality," etc.:  "The task, it seems, is to compel the terms of modernity to embrace those they have traditionally excluded, and to know that such an embrace cannot be easy; it would wrack and unsettle the polity that makes such an embrace." (161)

"I would insist that the speech act, as a rite of institution, is one whose contexts are never fully determined in advance, and that the possibility for the speech act to take on a non-ordinary meaning, to function in contexts where it has not belonged, is precisely the political promise of the performative, one that positions the performative at the center of a politics of hegemony, one that offers an unanticipated political future for deconstructive thinking." (161)

"To take up the name that one is called is no simple submission to prior authority, for the name is already unmoored from prior context, and entered into the labor of self-definition.  The word that wounds becomes an instrument of resistance in the redeployment that destroys the prior territory of its operation." (163)

"Insurrectionary speech becomes the necessary response to injurious language, a risk taken in response to being put at risk, a repetition in language that forces change." (163)
