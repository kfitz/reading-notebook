Debord, Guy.  The Society of the Spectacle.  trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith.  New York: Zone Books, 1994.


I. SEPARATION PERFECTED

1   in “modern conditions of production” (Debord 12) life presents itself as accumulation of spectacles; spectacle = “mere” representation

2   detached images; reality as an object of contemplation; the autonomous image

3   spectacle as part of society; illusion and false consciousness

4   spectacle as social relationship mediated by images

5   spectacle ≠ product of mass-image technology; spectacle = weltanshauung made material

6   spectacle as oucome and goal of the dominant mode of production; spectacle epitomizes the prevailing model of social life; spectacle as justification for existing system

7   separation; reality/image in social practice as totality; spectacle appears to be goal; language of the spectacle: signs of dominant organization of production

8   spectacle turns reality on its head, but is a product of real activity

9   “truth is a moment of falsehood” (Debord 14)

10  spectacle proclaims predominance of appearance; appearance as “visible negation of life” (Debord 14)

11  spectacle expresses the agenda of an economic and social formation

12  spectacle manifests itself as “an enormous positivity” (Debord 15)

13  tautology of the spectacle: means = ends

14  modern industrial society based on spectacle; spectacle as “perfect image of the ruling order” (Debord 15); spectacle as its own end

15  spectacle as chief product of contemporary society

16  spectacle as the mirror of production? (see Baudrillard); spectacle as reification

17  earlier stage in economy’s domination of social life: being \> having; now: having \> appearing; all individuality has assumed a social quality

18  images become real beings; sense of sight elevated to level of sense of touch; spectacle not visible to naked eye

19  spectacle as philosphization of reality

20  spectacle as material reconstruction of religious illusion

21  spectacle as “bad dream of modern society in chains” (Debord 18)

22  “the practical power of modern society has detached itself from itself and established itself in the spectacle as an independent realm” (Debord 18)

23  spectacle bound up in specialization of power

24  “By means of the spectacle the ruling order discourses endlessly upon itself in an uninterrupted monologue of self-praise.” (Debord 19); a second Nature; the apparatus (TV?) is not neutral — fills the spectacle’s needs; one-way nature of TV as supporting the “administration”

25  separation and the spectacle; spectacle and power; spectacle as self-generated

26  separation of worker and product (alienation?); “The triumph of an economic system founded on separation leads to the proletarianization of the world.” (Debord 21)

27  activity banned within the spectacle — no freedom except in activity

28  isolation and technology

29  origin of the spectacle in the world’s loss of unity; people become spectators, “linked only by a one-way relationship to the very center that maintains their idolation from one another” (Debord 22)

30  alienation of the spectator in submission to the contemplated object

31  workers experience success of production only as an “abundance of dispossession” (Debord 23)

32  spectacle’s function as manufacture of alienation

33  more and more of world becomes product of man’s alienated labor; more cut off from life

34  “The spectacle is capital accumulated to the point where it becomes image.” (Debord 24)


II. THE COMMODITY AS SPECTACLE

35  spectacle converts things to exclusively abstract value; “our old enemy the commodity”

36  commodity fetishism, “the domination of society by things whose qualities are ‘at the same time perceptible and imperceptible by the senses’” (Debord 26)

37  the world the spectacle reveals is the world of the commodity ruling over all lived experience

38  loss of quality echoes traits of production process; self-equivalence; the commodity is exclusively quantitative

39  spectacle excludes quality, but must eventually exceed quantity into quality; turns “the whole planet into a single world market” (Debord 27) — Jameson’s multi-national capitalism?

40  “The development of the forces of production is the real unconscious history that has built and modified the conditions of existence of human groups” (Debord 27); commodity production’s hegemony over the economy; transformation of human labor into commodity (wage-labor); “The economy transforms the world, but it transforms it into a world of the economy.” (Debord 28)

41  hegemony of the commodity at first covert — money appeared to be dominant; political economy as “dominant science and science of domination” (Debord 29)

42  “The spectacle corresponds to the historical moment at which the commodity completes its colonization of social life.” (Debord 29); commodities are all there is; dictatorship of modern economic production leads to imperialist domination by most productive countries; now alienated consumption added to alienated production as duty of masses

43  under hegemony of the commodity, workers no longer treated with contempt by ruling classes; treated with great politeness in their after-work roles as consumers; “the ‘perfected denial of man’” (Debord 30)

44  “The spectacle is a permanent opium war waged to make it impossible to distinguish goods from commodities” (Debord 30)

45  automation presents contradiction: meant to abolish labor, but must preserve labor as a commodity; must create new forms of labor — thus, the growth of the service sector

46  exchange value originally proxy of use value

47  falling use value creates commodity as illusion: spectacle

48  use value formerly implicit, now must be explicit

49  spectacle as facet of money, but money for contemplation only

50  capital no longer at center of society; now all society is portrait of capital

51  need for continued economic development replaces basic human needs with endless manufacture of pseudo-needs; ultimate pseudo-need is need for economy

52  “By the time society discovers that it is contingent on the economy, the economy has in point of fact become contingent on society.” (Debord 34)

53  society of the spectacle as the opposite of the project of revolution


III. UNITY AND DIVISION WITHIN APPEARANCES

54  spectacle both united and divided; unity = division / division = unity

55  struggles between forces which rule same system are not division but unity

56  spectacle points to different economic conditions in different countries as markers of “distinct social systems — but all is subsumed under universal system: capitalism

57  domination of under-developed regions through economic hegemony, but also through spectacle; “a worldwide division of spectacular tasks” (Debord 37)

58  division of spectacular tasks aimed at maintaining developing pole of existing order

59  modern society in thrall to a banalizing trend; pleasure in this life as pseudo-gratification which still embodies repression

60  star as spectacular representation of living human being — distilled banality; star projects power and leisure as goal of labor

61  star as opposite of individual; “Kennedy the orator survived himself, so to speak, and even delivered his own funeral oration, in the sense that Theodore Sorenson still wrote speeches for Kennedy’s successor in the very style that had done so much to create the dead man’s persona.” (Debord 40)

62  false choices within spectacle evolves into false conflicts

63  the unity of poverty

64  concentrated form of spectacle found in bureaucratic capitalism (totalitarianism); spectacle’s image of the good is in dictator, absolute celebrity

65  diffuse form of spectacle in modern capitalism — abundance of commodities

66  commodity on path to self-realization

67  use value replaced with commodity value; fetishism of the commodity

68  pseudo-need of consumerism; artificiality, falsification of life

69  each commodity presented as the ultimate goal; each falls short, but next is right behind

70  false gratification exposed as each commodity falls short

71  permanence of spectacle founded on change

72  “The unreal unity the spectacle proclaims masks the class division on which the real unity of the capitalist mode of production is based.” (Debord 46)


IV.  THE PROLETARIAT AS SUBJECT AND REPRESENTATION

73  development of forces of production shattered old rel of production; everything became historical

74  humans thrust into history; goal of history: itself; subject of history: self-production of the living

75  class struggles evolved in tandem with dialectic

76  Hegel: not interpreting world, but world’s transformation — but merely philosophical

77  proletariat’s actions confirm method of historical thought, but negate conclusions

78  historical thought must become practical thought

79  inseparability of Marx and Hegel; relationship misunderstood

80  Marx’s inversion of Hegel; Marx’s project as project of a conscious history

81  affinity of Marx’s thought with scientific thought, but fundamentally beyond science

82  bourgeois era neglects fact that science available for history must have been founded on history

83  utopianism, in thrall to scientific thinking; fails to consider the persistence of power (see Dewey)

84  scientific side of Marx’s thought made it subject to “ideologization”; Marx’s theory mutilated into Marxism

85  weakness of Marx’s theory; scientific conclustions as obstacles to proletarian consciousness

86  theoretical shortcomings of scientific defense of proletarian revolution come down to identification of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie

87  Marx’s linear model: “The first thing the linear model loses sight of is the fact that the bourgeoisie is the only revolutionary class that has ever been victorious.” (Debord 56-57)

88  bourgeoisie and proletariat as only two revolutionary classes in history, but rev. under different conditions: bourgeois rev. is a fait accompli; proletarian rev. is a project; “The bourgeoisie came to power because it was the class of the developing economy.  The proletariat will never come to embody power unless it becomes the class of consciousness.” (Debord 58)

89  Marx overrated value of scientific prediction?

90  fusion of knowledge and action

91  conflicting conceptions of proletarian rev., both authoritarian:  Marxists/Bakuninists; conflict of ideologies

92  anarchism; reatins terminal point of historical thought...

93  isolation of anarchists

94  illusion of anarchism: permanent imminence of revolution

95  “orthodox Marxism” of 2nd International; chose not to understand that for Marx unitary historical thought was the practical attitude to be adopted

96  ideology in hands of teachers supposed to educate the working class — implied passive learning; lost revolutionary aspect: “For the activity of all these people to have retained any revolutionary aspect whatsoever, capitalism would have had to find itself conveniently unable to put up with a reformism on the economic plane that it was perfectly able to tolerate on the political.” (Debord 66)

97  Bernstein “rejected the notion that a crisis of capitalism must occur, thus forcing the hand of the socialists, who declined to assume any revolutionary mantle in the absence of such a legitimating event.” (Debord 67)

98  Lenin applied revolutionary ideology of orthodox Marxism to conditions in Russia — revolution as profession = total social management

99  “The bloody end of the workers’ movement’s democratic illusions made a Russia of the whole world” (Debord 68)

100 moment of Bolshevism as “the definitive inauguration of an order of things that lies at the core of the modern spectacle’s rule: this was the moment when an image of the working class arose in radical opposition to the working class itself.” (Debord 69)

101 spectacular organization of ruling order; social reign of appearances

102 Bolshevism arose from backwardness of Russia and abdication of workers’ movements

103 revolutionary bureaucracy imposed new class rule

104 bureaucracy as sole owner of new state capitalism; accumulation of capital by means of terror

105 “Ideology was no longer a weapon, but an end in itself.” (Debord 73); a “local primitivism of the spectacle”

106 bureaucracy required to deny its own existence

107 Stalinism as reign of terror within the bureaucratic class; bureaucracy made owner by false consciousness; “False consciousness can maintain absolute power only through absolute terror” (Debord 74)

108 by the time ideology is transformed into the totalitarian lie, “truly historical thinking has for its part been so utterly annihilated that history itself . . . can no longer exist” (Debord 76)

109 fascism as attempt of bourgeois economy to defend itself from crisis and proletarian subversion; fascism as “a violent resurrection of myth”; fascism as “a cult of the archaic completely fitted out by modern technology” (Debord 77) — one factor in formation of the modern spectacle

110 bureaucracy helplessly tied to ideology that no one believes

111 bureaucracy’s title to ownership collapsing

112 Trotsky; Lukács

113 Trotskyism and neo-Leninism

114 proletariat of industrialized countries has lost its independence, but it has not been eliminated

115 spectacular system misunderstanding/misrepresenting signs of tendency toward negation; failure of capitalist abundance

116 revolutionary workers’ councils

117 power of the workers’ councils destined to supplant all other powers

118 appearance of workers’ councils as high point of proletarian movement, but unnoticed

119 revolutionary organization cannot represent the revolutionary class

120 revolutionary organization as part of process of transition from theory to praxis

121 rev. org. must constitute integral critique of society

122 rev. org. cannot combat alienation by means of alienated forms of struggle

123 need for theory in the revolution

124 “Revolutionary theory is now the sworn enemy of all revolutionary ideology — and it knows it.” (Debord 90)


V. TIME AND HISTORY

125 man is one with time; human history only exists in natural history, but natural history exists only in human history; temporalization of man = humanization of time

126 society only conscious of present

127 cyclical time:  nomadic peoples; fixation in locality (pastoralization); shift from pastoralism to agriculture = beginning of labor; agrarian mode as fullest development of cyclical time; myth

128 the social appropriation of time requires a classed society

129 cyclical time as time without conflict

130 cold societies: minimized participation in history; structured to rule out change

131 coincidence of the emergence of political power and the dissolution of kinship bonds; left cyclical time and began a purposeful succession of events (irreversible time); writing

132 writted chronicles as expression of power’s irreversible time

133 dry chronology destined to become conscious history, but many first had to participate in history

134 history and power; ancient Greece; production of social life the static domain of slave class

135 Rome: regression of Western thought not accompanied by return to mythic structures; instead, rise of semi-historical religions

136 religion as compromise between myth and history (cyclical and irreversible time); time oriented toward single, final event

137 Middle Ages: spread of irreversible time in form of stages of life, life as journey

138 end of Middle Ages: irreversible time experienced as obsession with death; millenarianism

139 Renaissance: break with eternity; life as the enjoyment of the passing of time

140 bourgeoisie’s new irreversible time: labor-time

141 victory of bourgeoisie as victory of profoundly historical time; elimination of cyclical time

142 metamorphosis of irreversible time into the time of things; history as consumable product

143 bourgeoisie introduced historical time but denied society the use of it; historical time now created by the proletariat

144 bourgeoisie’s goal of freedom revealed to be freedom of trade

145 “The development of capitalism meant the unification of irreversible time on a world scale.” (Debord 107)

146 “The irreversible time of production is first and foremost the measure of commodities.” (Debord 107)


VI. SPECTACULAR TIME

147 time of production; time as commodity; time devalued

148 consumable time; pseudo-cyclical time

149 pseudo-cyclical time as consumable disguise of time-as-commodity of production system

150 pseudo-cyclical time echoes old cyclical rhythms

151 pseudo-cyclical time as time transformed by industry

152 capitalist sale of “fully equipped” blocks of time — spectacle

153 “Consumable pseudo-cyclical time is the time of the spectacle: in the narrow sense, as the time appropriate to the consumption of images, and, in the broadest sense, as the image of the consumption of time.” (Debord 112)

154 our epoch as epoch without festival; “The reality of time has been replaced by its publicity.” (Debord 113)

155 cyclical time v. spectacular time

156 domination of present by past in spectacular time

157 individual life still not historical

158 “The spectacle, being the reigning social organization of a paralyzed history, of a paralyzed memory, of an abadonment of any history founded in historical time, is in effect a false consciousness of time.” (Debord 114)

159 prerequisite to workers as consumers of time: violent expropriation of their time

160 reduction of importance of the biological element of time

161 time as necessary alienation (Hegel); spectacular time involves spatial alienation

162 grand style of our era: obvious but carefully concealed need for revolution

163 revolutionary project of a classless society: withering away of social measurement of time in favor of an individual and collective irreversible time

164 world has dream of such time, but not consciousness to make it real


VII. ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING

165 unification of space under capitalism; unification as trivialization; power to homogenize

166 “the free space of commodities” (Debord 120)

167 “This society eliminates geographical distance only to reap distance internally in the form of spectacular separation.” (Debord 120)

168 tourism: human movement as commodity; all is banal

169 urbanism: mode of appropriation of the natural environment by capitalism

170 dominance of space over time? (Jameson)

171 urbanism as technology of separation

172 urbanism as means of safeguarding class power; isolation of populations as means of control; pseudo-communities

173 architecture for the poor: mass housing

174 urban self-destruction: centrifugal pull

175 opposition between town and country now resolved as both collapse

176 history born in cities; city as locus of history

177 creation of new, artifical peasantry

178 “The same history that threatens this twilight world is capable of subjecting space to a directly experienced time.” (Debord 126) — ???

179 revolutionary idea in city planning: reconstructing cities in accordance with needs of workers’ councils


VIII. NEGATION AND CONSUMPTION IN THE CULTURAL SPHERE

180 “Culture is the general sphere of knowledge, and of representations of lived experience, within a historical society divided into classes; what this amounts to is that culture is the power to generalize” (Debord 130); culture’s self-abolition, self-negation

181 struggle between tradition and innovation predicated on perpetual victory of innovation

182 collapse of culture; lack of rationality in a separated culture dooms it

183 “Culture is the meaning of an insufficiently meaningful world.” (Debord 131)

184 end of the history of culture, two aspects: 1. self-transcendance as history (critique of society); 2. management within the spectacle (defense of class power)

185 oppositions within aspects

186 end of art

187 language of real communication has been lost; no satifactory replacement yet found

188 “The greatness of art makes its appearance only as dusk begins to fall over life.” (Debord 133)

189 historical time in art: the baroque; baroque as art of change, embodying ephemerality

190 art in period of dissolution as both art of change and expression of impossibility of change

191 dadism/surrealism paralleled proletarian revolution’s last great offensive

192 “Spectacular consumption preserves the old culture in congealed form” (Debord 136); history buried in culture (see Jameson, pastiche and the postmodern?)

193 star commodity

194 spectacular thought: “a general science of false consciousness” (Debord 138)

195 corrupting force of spectacular power; the spectator

196 modern sociology as a spectacular critique of the spectacle; structuralism as apologetics of the spectacle

197 sociology

198 spectacular consumption of commodities

199 the “truth” of spectacular society as its negation

200 spectacle as “the proliferation of prefabricated ‘pseudo-events’” (Debord 141); pseudo-history

201 structuralism as anti-historical thought

202 “categories express not only the forms but also the conditions of existence” (Debord 142)

203 need for bringing together theory and practice

204 language of critical theory as dialectical: “Not a negation of style, but the style of negation.” (Debord 144)

205 style of exposition of dialectical theory

206 dialectical style: the reversal of established relationships and the diversion (détournement) of attainments of earlier critical efforts

207 “Plagiarism is necessary.” (Debord 145)

208 détournement as the antithesis of quotation; “the fluid language of anti-ideology” (Debord 146)

209 ???

210 “Only the real negation of culture can inherit culture’s meaning.” (Debord 146)

211 critique of culture manifests itself as unified


IX. IDEOLOGY IN MATERIAL FORM

212 “Ideology is the foundation of the thought of a class society within the conflictual course of history.” (Debord 150); spectacle as the materialization of ideology

213 ideology no longer a historical choice, but an assertion of the obvious

214 ideology distributed throughout society as a whole via the spectacle

215 spectacle as the acme of ideology; spectacle as the expression of estrangement

216 “the spectacle preserves the ideological features of both materialism and idealism” (Debord 151)

217 parallel between ideology and schizophrenia

218 spectator imprisoned by the spectacle

219 spectacle erases dividing lines between self and world, true and false

220 “the quest for the critical truth of the spectacle must also be a true critique” (Debord 154)

221 emancipation from the spectacle?
