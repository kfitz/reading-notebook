"Signature Event Context"

difficulties in concept of “communication”

Writing and Telecommunication

writing as means of communication, “extending enormously, if not infinitely, the domain of oral or gestural communication” (Derrida 3) — but does the sense of “extension” assume a homogenous space of communication?

Condillac’s study of the origin and function of the written text in Essay on the Origin of Human Knowledge — conveying pre-existing thoughts to those who are absent; implies that writing itself will have no effect on the content it transmits; purely representational

absence:  the absence of the addressee, not the absence of the sender; absence as the modification of presence (?)

for the French “ideologues” descending from Condillac, “communication is that which circulates a representation as an ideal content (meaning); an writing is a species of this general communication.  A species:  a communication admitting a relative specificity within a genre” (Derrida 6)

two propositions:  as every sign presupposes absence, “the absence within the particular field of writing will have to be of an original type if one intends to grant any specificity whatsoever to the written sign”; if this absence in fact says something about all communication, “writing would no longer be one species of communication, and all the concepts to whose generality writing had been subordinated (including the concept itself qua meaning, idea or grasp of meaning and of idea, the concept of communication, of the sign, etc.) would appear to be noncritical, ill-formed, or destined, rather, to insure the authority and the force of a certain historical discourse” (Derrida 7)

différance as part of writing’s absence, the deferral of meaning

“In order for my ‘written communication’ to retain its function as writing, i.e., its readability, it must remain readable despite the absolute disappearance of any receiver, determined in general.  My communication must be repeatable — iterable — in the absolute absence of the receiver or of any empirically determinable collectivity of receivers.” (Derrida 7)

Derrida’s absence is “not a continuous modification of presence, it is a rupture in presence, the ‘death’ or the possibility of the ‘death’ of the receiver inscribed in the structure of the mark” (Derrida 8)

same holds for disappearance of sender:  “To write is to produce a mark that will constitute a sort of machine which is productive in turn, and which my future disappearance will not, in principle, hinder in its functioning” (Derrida 8)

“This essential drift [derive] bearing on writing as an iterative structure, cut off from all absolute responsibility, from consciousness as the ultimate authority, orphaned and separated at birth from the assistance of its father, is precisely what Plato condemns in the Phaedrus..” (Derrida 8)

essential predicates of writing thus include its iterability in the absence of both the receiver and the sender; also include a force of rupture with its original context of production; force of rupture has something to do with spacing

do these predicates apply only to “written” communication, or do they apply to orality as well? — Derrida radically subsumes orality under writing, making the spoken sign a species of the written:  “This structural possibility of being weaned from the referent or form the signified (hence from communication and from its context) seems to me to make every mark, including those which are oral, a grapheme in general” (Derrida 10)

Husserl and the crisis of meaning — symbols divorced from the intent to signify; utterances deprived of objective signification; agrammaticality

“And this is the possibility on which I want to insist:  the possibility of disengagement and citational graft which belongs to the structure of every mark, spoken or written, and which constitutes every mark in writing before and outside of every horizon of semio-linguistic communication” (Derrida 12)

“Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be cited, put between quotation marks; in so doing it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable.” (Derrida 12)

citationality as iterability

Parasites.  Iter, of Writing:  That It Perhaps Does Not Exist

introduces “the problematic of the performative” (Derrida 13)

Austin only considers speech acts as acts of communication; performatives as conveying force rather than meaning; performatives with internal rather than external referents; substitution of force for truth value

A. thus appears the have shattered the notion of communication as purely semiotic, linguistic, or symbolic

yet, difficulties in A. have root in his demand for context; infelicities result from failures in the total context

“The conscious presence of speakers or receivers participating in the accomplishment of a performative, their conscious and intentional presence in the totality of the operation, implies teleologically that no residue [reste] escapes the present totalization.” (Derrida 14)

“Austin’s procedure is rather remarkable and typical of that philosophical tradition with which he would like to have so few ties.  It consists in recognizing that the possibility of the negative (in this case, of infelicities) is in fact a structural possibility, that failure is an essential risk of the operations under consideration; then, in a move which is almost immediately simultaneous, in the name of a kind of ideal regulation, it excludes that risk as accidental, exterior, on which teaches us nothing about the linguistic phenomenon being considered.” (Derrida 15) — this strikes me as a radical misreading of Austin, suggesting he relegates infelicites to context; in fact, he expands them to subsume the whole of language — this is what allows Butler to relegate Austin to liberal humanism

conventionality of the speech act — D. read A. as concentrating that conventionality in the circumstance of the speech act and not in the locution itself — claims that A. excludes such failures in locution from consideration

second exclusion:  the consideration of citationality — “the possibility for every performative utterance (and a priori every other utterance) to be ‘quoted’.” (Derrida 16) — A. relegates these usages of language to the “parasitic”:  “It is as just such a ‘parasite’ that writing has always been treated by the philosophical tradition, and the connection in this case is by no means coincidental.” (Derrida 17)

“ultimately, isn’t it true that what Austin excludes as anomaly, exception, ‘non-serious,’ citation (on stage, in a poem, or a soliloquy) is the determined modification of a general citationality — or rather, a general iterability — without which there would not even be a ‘successful’ performative?” (Derrida 17)

rather than opposing purity of performatives to citationality or iterability, one should construct “a differential typology of forms of iteration….  In such a typology, the category of intention will not disappear; it will have its place, but from that place it will no longer be able to govern the entire scene and system of utterance [l’énonciation].” (Derrida 18)

“if one maintains that such ordinary language, or the ordinary circumstances of language, excludes a general citationality or iterability, does that not mean that the ‘ordinariness’ in question — the thing and the notion — shelter a lure, the teleological lure of consciousness (whose motivations, indestructible necessity, and systematic effects would be subject to analysis)?” (Derrida 18)

différance as “the irreducible absence of intention” (Derrida 18)

Signatures

Austin’s justification for his preference for the form of the first person present indicative in his discussion of performatives:  “The justification, in the final instance, is the reference made therein to what Austin calls the source (p. 60) of the utterance.” (Derrida 19)

“Not only does Austin not doubt that the source of an oral utterance in the present indicative active is present to the utterance [énonciation] and its statement [énoncé]… but he does not even doubt that the equivalent of this tie to the source utterance is simply evident in and assured by a signature” (Derrida 19)

analysis of relationship of signatures to the present and the source:  “In order for the tethering to the source to occur, what must be retained is the absolute singularity of a signature-event and a signature-form: the pure reproducibility of a pure event” (Derrida 20)

“In order to function, that is, to be readable, a signature must have a repeatable, iterable, imitable form; it must be able to be detached from the present and singular intention of its production.” (Derrida 20) — yet this iterability seems a corruption

“We are witnessing not an end of writing that would restore, in accord with McLuhan’s ideological representation, a transparency or an immediacy to social relations; but rather the increasingly powerful historical expansion of a general writing, of which the system of speech, consciousness, meaning, presence, truth, etc., would be only an effect, and should be analyzed as such.  It is the exposure of this effect that I have called elsewhere logocentrism” (Derrida 20)

“an opposition of metaphysical concepts (e.g., speech/writing, presence/absence, etc.) is never the confrontation of two terms, but a hierarchy and the order of a subordination” (Derrida 21)
