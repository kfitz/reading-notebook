Hall, Donald. The Academic Community: A Manual for Change. Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 2007.


"Communal change does not happen quickly, neatly, or linearly, but it does happen all the time, and it is crucial that we continuously explore the extent to which we as individuals have an ability to contribute to contextual change that is thoughtful and in line with our intellectual and political commitments." (Hall 4)

"what made many of my senior colleagues so miserable was the fact that they had lost -- and refused to reclaim -- a productive engagement with the larger flow of intellectual and professional conversation outside of their own circle of angry friends.... Those closed, internally reinforcing circles of resentment and feelings of victimhood are quite the opposite of the expansive and intellectually adventurous circles of professional growth and change that much of this book will discuss." (Hall 6)

"Change is uncomfortable and nerve-wracking for anyone, but for academics, alone or in groups, embracing change means giving up one of the foundational myths of academic identity:  the myth of mastery." (Hall 6)

"My belief is that most of us in the academy -- skilled researchers, critical readers of texts, sensitive teachers, and caring colleagues -- do not cling with desperate tenacity to our own authority and professional patterns.  Oftentimes, we are simply invested in narratives and customs that we have yet to fully interrogate." (Hall 7)

"our individual needs and desires as members of a community must always operate in negotiation with the macrolevel concerns of our departments and colleagues.  Furthermore, our understanding of the dynamics of our department must always work in tandem with our explorations of the larger needs and priorities of our colleges and universities.  And finally, our colleges and universities must operate responsibly with reference to and some understanding of the perspectives of their surrounding communities." (Hall 10-11)

"We can only move from solipsism to responsible intellectualism by embracing our ties to others, and this means finding ways of engaging others in dialogue." (Hall 11)

"I suggest that we move away from a model of training scholarly monologists, and move toward seeing graduate education as a venure where intellectual conversation is emphasized, and where academics-in-training learn to be community members." (Hall 13)

"If we retain our commitment to conversation as an ongoing process, one in which we participate as partners but not as determiners of outcomes, one that may reach temporary points of suspension but never a terminus or moment of triumph for one participant, then we can minimize not only the risk of burnout but also of our own possible superfluity in contemporary American culture."  (Hall 15-16)

"If 'intellectual' and 'academic' have become pejoratives, then we in the academic community must take responsibility for reclaiming them and reasserting their value and the value of the work we do." (Hall 16)

"Our lives are narratives entangled with other narratives, all demanding interpretation and response, and leading, through their intersection, interaction, and critical engagement, to an ability to live differently and more ethically." (Hall 21)

"What intellectual and pedagogical commitments can any of us articulate that will help us make intellectually productive and communally responsible choices under difficult conditions?" (Hall 30)

"the responsibility that all of us share is to take the situations that we find ourselves in, add value to them, shape them to the extent that we can to meet our intellectual and pedagogical commitments, leave them if we find them intolerable, but above all, expend our energy '*aiming at the 'good life' with and for others, in just institutions*,' to the extent that we can create that good life and those just institutions." (Hall 30)

"If we think of ourselves in this way, as texts to be read, critiqued, and possibly emulated, then we may be spared the ever-present, ever-possible trap of academic solipsism." (Hall 33)

"Fame is only a chance by-product of what should be a life lived with critical awareness of our own needs and talents, in negotiation with those of our family members, friends, students, and colleagues." (Hall 36)

"it is crucial for us to remember that even if we sequester ourselves in an office or a laboratory and spend our days and nights working to generate new knowledge about plant biology or artificial intelligence, we do so finally only as a precursor to transmitting that new knowledge to others: through publication, through conversation or oral presentation, and through teaching in the classroom." (Hall 40)

"We are doing our undergraduates and our own profession a disservice if we fail to engage in the work of undergraduate teaching with energy and enthusiasm.  That enormous population will be the voting public (and the pool of potential donors) whose financial support is crucial to the survival of our public institutions." (Hall 41)

"I am unabashedly suggesting that we make the explicit aim of undergraduate education the creation of a new generation of intellectuals." (Hall 45)

"In asking our students to find a vocational passion, a projected life plan, and a venue where they can commit themselves to do that specific and practical intellectual work, we are training a generation of students who understand their field(s) of study as ongoing conversations, and then add knowledgeably, responsibly, and creatively to those conversations." (Hall 47)

"'What do they think they know and why do they think they know it?' is the first question that we must ask on the first day of every semester." (Hall 49)

"As intellectuals in training, students should learn *not* to enter disciplinary and consequential social conversations as they might argue over a bar tab or poker hand; they should attempt first to understand the terms of the conversation and the norms encoded therein.  Then they should enter the conversation and advance a thesis.  That constitutes an intellectualism based in knowledge, responsibility, and innovation." (Hall 53)

Gadamer: "To be in a conversation... means to be beyond oneself, to think with the other, and to come back to oneself as if to another" (Hall 54, quoting "Destrucktion and Deconstruction" 110)

"shifting the desired outcomes of our pedagogies from 'mastery' of course material to 'dialogic interaction' with that material (which always requires a depth of understanding and does not, therefore, abandon the expectation of knowledge underlying the rhetoric of 'mastery')" (Hall 55-56)

"It is imperative that we, in the process of mentoring our students into intellectualism, also demystify our own work and intellectualism." (Hall 59)

"it is also important to emphasize that to be a responsible participant in a conversation is, in effect, to be a responsible member of a community or set of communities." (Hall 66)

"'service' as a professional practice is the placement of communal needs above our own narrow interests and desires." (Hall 66-67)

"In a sense, it represents the opposite of the bloated self-regard of the 'star' or 'diva,' because it demands humility, a sacrifice of time and energy that could be used instead for careerist purposes, and an ability to reach consensus, or at least agree to disagree, and then to move forward with a group process." (Hall 67)

"Collegiality means responsible citizenship within our institutions, embracing the same qualities that one would hope for in responsible citizens of the nation and globe: thoughtfulness, attentiveness to the needs of others, and a willingness to listen carefully and engage in meaningful communication across and in spite of differences." (Hall 67-68)

"the overarching point of this book is that if we are going to be agents of change within our departments, institutions, research fields, and broader communities, we have to be able to engage in caring and careful dialogue, embracing the possibilities of an intellectualism that is professionally self-aware and eager to engage others in potentially transformative exchange." (Hall 69)

"Even if our students' capstone projects and much of their other research that leads to publication or presentation is very often solely conducted and single-authored (especially in the humanities and social sciences), we can still impress upon them how such work is always done in dialogic fashion.  In every field of research, one's own articulation must engage with previous articulations." (Hall 73)

"all successful research and writing has to involve a decentering of the author from the position of sole authority.  She or he must listen carefully as well as express skillfully." (Hall 74)

"As communities of teachers/scholars/institutional citizens, publication is only one way that we participate in intellectual exchange." (Hall 85)

"To my mind, this is the most important aspect of the work being done today in the field of 'professional studies': the fostering of a dialogue concerning why we do what we do as academics, how we variously find and make meaning in our professional lives and careers, and how we can exercise agency in choosing to do things differently in our departments and broader institutional settings." (Hall 85-86)

"By productivity I do not mean efficiency or some quasi-Fordist emphasis on quantitative output (indeed, that is a stressor that I will discuss later).  But I do believe that a vibrant university community is one that does produce new types of knowledge, new forms of critical awareness in students, and new or usefully different answers to compelling questions."  (Hall 87)

"*community is not consensus*.  Community is a conversational process, a 'becoming' that is never fully achieved, a process that we must choose and continuously commit to." (Hall 89)

"it is imperative that we create diverse nexuses of shared interest and conversational energy" (Hall 90)

"By sharing a rough draft, I admit to you my human fallibility, my humility, my need for your help.  By responding sensitively and generously to that rough work, you demonstrate to me your concern and respect, your acknowledgment of the importance of what I am doing (that it is worth your time and effort to contribute to it), and (depending on how sensitively and self-reflectively you offer your advice) your recognition of the expertise that I bring to my work that you can contribute to but not claim mastery over." (Hall 94)

"the percentage of Penn State's budget that comes from the state dropped from 54 percent in 1976-77 to 31 percent in 2001-2002, while the University of Virginia's slid from 28 percent in 1985 to around 8 percent in 2003" (Hall 106)

"As education is redefined as solely a private responsibility rather than a public good, that education will itself be redefined to serve the narrowest forms of self-protection and self-interest.... It seems inevitable that intellectual growth, expansive knowledge seeking, and experimentation with the arts and humanities will be perceived as wastes of time and money when students are accumulating huge amounts of debt in a cost-driven rush to what must be very high-paying employment." (Hall 106)

"while student enrollments in college increased by 44 percent from 1977 to 2003, student indebtedness increased by 833 percent" (Hall 107)

"Engaging in public conversation does not mean telling people what to think, pointing out their flaws, or simply seeking affirmation for our own beliefs.  It means humility and a willingness to demonstrate that we in the academy hear others' opinions, respect those opinions (even if we disagree with them), learn through our interactions, and are conscious of (and grateful for) the privileges and rewards that still characterize many careers in the academy" (Hall 110)

"Renewing our engagement with the public is self-protective in the narrow sense of protecting and augmenting our current and future funding but also in the broader sense of protecting our society from fundamentalism and fascism." (Hall 128)

"We need to reconceive our academic selves as ones demonstrating continuous intellectual engagement, but not depending upon the goal of or a state of mastery." (Hall 140)
