Halberstam, Judith. The Queer Art of Failure. Duke UP, 2011.

**Introduction**

“We are all used to having our dreams crushed, our hopes smashed, our illusions shattered, but what comes after hope?… What is the alternative, in other words, to cynical resignation on the one hand and naïve optimism on the other?” (1)

“Through the use of manifestoes, a range of political tactics, and new technologies of representation, radical utopians continue to search for different ways of being in the world and being in relation to one another than those already prescribed for the liberal and consumer subject. This book uses ‘low theory’ (a term I am adapting from Stuart Hall’s work) and popular knowledge to explore alternatives and to look for a way out of the usual traps and impasses of binary formulations. Low theory tries to located all the in-between spaces that save us from being snared by the books of hegemony and speared by the seductions of the gift shop. It also makes its peace with the possibility that alternatives dwell in the murky waters of a counterintuitive, often impossibly dark and negative realm of critique and refusal.” (2)

“Rather than just arguing for a reevaluation of these standards of passing and failing, _The Queer Art of Failure_ dismantles the logics of success and failure with which we currently live. Under certain circumstances failing, losing, forgetting, unmaking, undoing, unbecoming, not knowing may in fact offer more creative, more cooperative, more surprising ways of being in the world.” (2-3)

“failure allows us to escape the punishing norms that discipline behavior and manage human development with the goal of delivering us from unruly childhoods to orderly and predictable adulthoods.” (3)

“For the nonbelievers outside the cult of positive thinking, however, the failures and losers, the grouchy, irritable whiners who do not want to ‘have a nice day’ and who do not believe that getting cancer has made them better people, politics offers a better explanatory framework than personal disposition. For these negative thinkers, there are definite advantages to failing.” (4)

“a new kind of optimism is born. Not an optimism that relies on positive thinking as an explanatory engine for social order, nor one that insists upon the bright side at all costs; rather this is a little ray of sunshine that produces shade and light in equal measure and knows that the meaning of one always depends upon the meaning of the other.” (5)

“Being taken seriously means missing out on the chance to be frivolous, promiscuous, and irrelevant. The desire to be taken seriously is precisely what compels people to follow the tried and true paths of knowledge production around which I would like to map a few detours.” (6)

“the goal is to lose one’s way, and indeed to be prepared to lose more than one’s way.” (6)

“These alternative cultural and academic realms, the areas beside academia rather than within it, the intellectual worlds conjured by losers, failures, dropouts, and refuseniks, often serve as the launching pad for alternatives precisely when the university cannot.” (7)

“As the big disciplines begin to crumble like banks that have invested in bad securities we might ask more broadly, Do we really want to shore up the ragged boundaries of our shared interests and intellectual commitments, or might we rather take this opportunity to rethink the project of learning and thinking altogether?” (7)

see Moten and Harney, “The University and the Undercommons: Seven Theses” (Social Text, 2004): “the critical academic is not the answer to encroaching professionalization but an extension of it” (8)

“Illegibility may in fact be one way of escaping the political manipulation to which all university fields and disciplines are subject.” (10) 

“Disciplines qualify and disqualify, legitimate and delegitimate, reward and punish; most important, they statically reproduce themselves and inhibit dissent.” (10)

“_Resist mastery_”: “In my book this resistance takes the form of investing in counterintuitive modes of knowing such as failure and stupidity” (11)

“_Privilege the naïve or nonsensical_”: “The naïve or the ignorant may in fact lead to a different set of knowledge practices.” (12)

“_Suspect memorialization_”: “Memory is itself a disciplinary mechanism that Foucault calls ‘a ritual of power’; it selects for what is important (the histories of triumph), it reads a continuous narrative into one full of ruptures and contradictions, and it sets precedents for other ‘memorializations.’” (15)

“we can think about _low theory_ as a mode of accessibility, but we might also think about it as a kind of theoretical model that flies below the radar, that is assembled from eccentric texts and examples and that refuses to confirm the hierarchies of knowing that maintain the _high_ in high theory.” (16)

“Low theory might constitute the name for a counterhegemonic form of theorizing, the theorization of alternatives within an undisciplined zone of knowledge production.” (18)

“dominant history teems with the remnants of alternative possibilities, and the job of the subversive intellectual is to trace the lines of the worlds they conjured and left behind.” (19)

“The texts that I prefer here do not make us better people or liberate us from the culture industry, but they might offer strange and anticapitalist logics of being and acting and knowing, and they will harbor covert and overt queer worlds.” (20-21)

“I believe in low theory in popular places, in the small, the inconsequential, the antimonumental, the micro, the irrelevant; I believe in making a difference by thinking little thoughts and sharing them widely.” (21)

“I begin by addressing the dark heart of the negativity that failure conjures, and I turn from the happy and productive failures explored in animation to darker territories of failure associated with futility, sterility, emptiness, loss, negative affect in general, and modes of unbecoming.” (23)

“In order to inhabit the bleak territory of failure we sometimes have to write and acknowledge dark histories, histories within which the subject collaborates with rather than always opposes oppressive regimes and dominant ideology.” (23)

“All in all, this is a book about alternative ways of knowing and being that are not unduly optimistic, but nor are they mired in nihilistic critical dead ends.” (24)

performance event “reminded me to take more chances, more risks in thinking, to turn away from the quarrels that seem so important to the discipline and to engage the ideas that circulate widely in other communities.” (24)

**Chapter One: Animating Revolt and Revolting Animation**

“Childhood, as many queers in particular recall, is a long lesson in humility, awkwardness, limitation, and what Kathryn Bond Stockton has called ‘growing sideways.’” (27)

“How do neo-anarchistic narrative forms find their way into children’s entertainment, and what do adult viewers make of them? More important, what does animation have to do with revolution?” (29)

“In a postindustrial landscape where the size of white families has plummeted, where the nuclear family itself has become something of an anachronism, and where a majority of women live outside of conventional marriages, the elevation of pets to the status of love objects certainly demands attention.” (37)

“we might think of animation as a way of maintaining the animality of animal social worlds” (37)

“Why do spectators (conservative parents, for instance) endorse these queer and monstrous narratives despite their radical message, and how does the whimsical nature of the animated world allow for the smuggling of radical narratives into otherwise clichéd interactions about friendship, loyalty, and family values?” (43)

“The Pixarvolt genre makes animation itself into a feature of kinetic political action rather than just an elaborate form of puppetry.” (45)

“In _Over the Hedge_, _Robots_, _Finding Nemo_, and other Pixarvolts desire for difference is not connected to a neoliberal ‘Be yourself’ mentality or to special individualism for ‘incredible’ people; rather the Pixarvolt films connect individualism to selfishness, to untrammeled consumption, and they oppose it with a collective mentality…. The Pixarvolt films, unlike their unrevolting conventional animation counterparts, seem to know that their main audience is children, and they seem to also know that children do not invest in the same things adults invest in: children are not coupled, they are not romantic, they do not have a religious morality, they are not afraid of death or failure, they are collective creatures, they are in a constant state of rebellion against their parents, and they are not the masters of their domain.” (47)

**Chapter Two: Dude, Where’s My Phallus? Forgetting, Losing, Looping**

“Stupidity conventionally means different things in relation to different subject positions; for example, stupidity in white men can signify new modes of domination, but stupidity in women of all ethnicities inevitably symbolized their status as, in psychoanalytic terms, ‘castrated’ or impaired.” (54)

“Stupid women make men feel bigger, better, smarter. But what is the appeal in North America of the stupid man, and why does the representation of male stupidity not lead to male disempowerment?… Male stupidity masks the will to power that lies just behind the goofy grin, and it masquerades as some kind of internalization of feminist critiques…. Male stupidity is in fact a new form of macho, and it comes at a time when alternative masculinities have achieved some small measure of currency.” (57)

“I am not saying that _Dude, Where’s My Car?_ is a fitting alternative to grim militaristic scenarios of crusading North Americans, but I am wishing that we could all be a little less self-important and a little more stupid.” (68)

“forgetfulness becomes a rupture with the eternally self-generating present, a break with a self-authorizing past, and an opportunity for a non-hetero-reproductive future.” (70)

“Obviously forgetting has been a colonial tactic in the past and has produced a hierarchical relationship between foreign and native knowledge, but in order to remember and recognize the anticolonial struggles, other narratives do have to be forgotten and unlearned.” (77)

“Forgetfulness has long been associated with radical action and a revolutionary relation to the now. The situationists understood themselves to be ‘partisans of forgetting,’ allowing them to ‘forget the past’ and ‘live in the present.’ Furthermore situationists saw forgetting as the weapon of the proletariat, who have no past and for whom the choice is only and always ‘now or never.’” (80)

“While we live every day with the evidence of the damage done by forgetting — the desire in American society to ‘put slavery behind us,’ for example — it is still worth assessing the power of forgetfulness in creating new futures not tied to old traditions.” (83)

“Nietszche’s notion that happiness requires forgetfulness echoes the psychoanalytic notion of repression; indeed Freud once characterized the hysteric as someone who ‘suffers from reminiscences.’” (83)

**Chapter Three: The Queer Art of Failure**

“The queer art of failure turns on the impossible, the improbably, the unlikely, and the unremarkable. It quietly loses, and in losing it imagines other goals for life, for love, for art, and for being.” (88)

“The concept of ‘weapons of the weak’ can be used to recatgorize what looks like inaction, passivity, and lack of resistance in terms of the practice of stalling the business of the dominant.” (88)

“How else might we imagine failure, and in terms of what kinds of desired political outcomes? How has failure been wielded for different political projects? And what kind of pedagogy, what kind of epistemology lurks behind those activities that have been awarded the term _failure_ in Anglo-American culture?” (92)

“While liberal histories build triumphant political narratives with progressive stories of improvement and success, radical histories must contend with a less tidy past, one that passes on legacies of failure and loneliness as the consequences of homophobia and racism and xenophobia.” (98-99)

“If we want to make the antisocial turn in queer theory we must be willing to turn away from the comfort zone of polite exchange in order to embrace a truly political negativity, one that promises, this time, to fail, to make a mess, to fuck shit up, to be loud, unruly, impolite, to breed resentment, to bash back, to speak up and out, to disrupt, assassinate, shock, and annihilate.” (110)

**Chapter Four: Shadow Feminisms: Queer Negativity and Radical Passivity**

“Beginning with the injunction ‘Lose Your Mother’ and building toward a conclusion that will advocate a complete dismantling of self, I explore a feminist politics that issues not from a doing but from an undoing, not from a being or becoming woman but from a refusal to be or to become woman as she has been defined and imagined within Western philosophy…. This feminism, a feminism grounded in negation, refusal, passivity, absence, and silence, offers spaces and modes of unknowing, failing, and forgetting as part of an alternative feminist project, a shadow feminism which has nestled in more positivist accounts and unraveled their logics from within.” (124)

“If we refuse to become women, we might ask, what happens to feminism? Or, to pose the question another way: Can we find feminist frameworks capable of recognizing the political project articulated in the form of refusal?” (126)

“In what follows I propose a radical form of masochistic passivity that not only offers up a critique of the organizing logic of agency and subjectivity itself, but that also opts out of certain systems build around a dialectic between colonizer and colonized.” (131)

“masochism is an underused way of considering the relationship between self and other, self and technology, self and power in queer feminism.” (135)

“While the male masochist inhabits a kind of heroic antiheroism by refusing social privilege and offering himself up Christ-like as a martyr for the cause, the female masochist’s performance is far more complex and offers a critique of the very ground of the human.” (139)

“But there is a problem with trying to bind masochistic critiques of the subject to humanistic renegotiations with selfhood. In many ways this reconfiguring of masochism as a way of grappling with and coming to terms with violence rewrites the dilemma I identified at the start of this chapter in terms of a feminism that needs to rescue other ‘women’ from their own destructive tendencies.” (139)

“In a liberal realm where the pursuit of happiness, as Jamaica Kincaid might say, is both desirable and mandatory and where certain formulations of self (as active, voluntaristic, choosing, propulsive) dominate the political sphere, radical passivity may signal another kind of refusal, the refusal quite simply to be.” (140)

**Chapter Five: “The Killer in Me Is the Killer in You”: Homosexuality and Fascism**

“as much as we have to excavate some histories that have been rendered invisible, we also bury others, and sometimes we do both at the same time.” (148)

“So ‘queer negativity’ here might refer to a project within which one remains committed to not only scrambling dominant logics of desire but also to contesting homogenous models of gar identity within which a queer victim stands up to his or her oppressors and emerges a hero.” (149)

“While it is very much ‘to the speaker’s benefit,’ as Foucault cheekily puts it, to tell this kind of story about the remarkable emergence of sexual minorities from the tyranny of repressive regimes, it is also a way of ignoring the actual mechanics of the history of sexuality within which marginalized subjects participate in and endorse the very systems that marginalize them. But also it ignores the system by which socially transgressive behaviors take on the allure of danger precisely because we are so endlessly seduced by the idea that sexual expression is in and of itself a revolutionary act. That which seems off-limits becomes sexy, and in indulging our interest in the taboo we feel naughty.” (150)

“I want to understand why we cannot tolerate the linking of our desires to politics that disturb us.” (153)

“By asking what homosexuality might be for, what its function was, Hewitt moves the emphasis away from an uninterrupted account of homosexual struggle and allows for a much more variegated history of sexuality within which sexual otherness serves both dominant and subordinate regimes, sometimes at the same time.” (158)

“eros is not always and everywhere a force for good that has been met by negative and repressive power” (161)

“in order to capture the complexity of these shifting relations we cannot afford to settle on linear connections between radical desires and radical politics; instead we have to be prepared to be unsettled by the politically problematic connections history throws our way.” (162)

**Chapter Six: Animating Failure: Ending, Fleeing, Surviving**

“animated cinema, far from being a pure form of ideology, and hegemonic ideology at that, as Žižek claims, is in fact a rich technological field for rethinking collectivities, transformation, identification, animality, and posthumanity.” (174)

“Once you have an animation technique for the crowd, you need narratives about crowds, you need to animate the story line of the many and downplay the story line of the exception.” (176)

“animated cinema cannot be the staging of this or that unified set of ideological commitments. It must also always be the image of ideologically committed thought. It is also the image of change and transformation itself, so we should not be surprised to find that in animated cinema transformation is one of the most dominant themes.” (181)

“Queerness offers the promise of failure as a way of life (and here I am obviously amending Foucault’s formulation of homosexuality as ‘friendship as a way of life’), but it is up to us whether we choose to make good on that promise in a way that makes a detour around the usual markers of accomplishment and satisfaction.” (186)

“To live is to fail, to bungle, to disappoint, and ultimately to die; rather than searching for ways around death and disappointment, the queer art of failure involves acceptance of the finite, the embrace of the absurd, the silly, and the hopelessly goofy.” (186-87)
