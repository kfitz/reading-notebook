Berlant, Lauren. "Collegiality, Crisis, and Cultural Studies." ADE Bulletin, no. 117, Fall 1997, 4-9.

"Humility is not conventionally associated with the project of cultural studies.... the scholars who engage in this work seem to want to change the world through criticism: they risk grandiosity of the intellect in believing that their critical acts and pedagogical practices will have concrete effects that, collectively repeated over long duration, might help to bring into being a better understanding of cultural struggles and create a less unjust world." (4)

"Even the theorists and anthologists find defining cultural studies an impossible task, since it has no proper methodology, object of study, or home discipline." (4)

"cultural studies is also engaged in an experiment with the organization of knowledge around the objects, spaces, and events it entextualizes" (4)

"At the time of this writing, a backlast against cultural studies is emerging in the humanities and the humanistic social sciences." (4)

"But it is hasty and frequently in bad faith to identify cultural studies in general as anecdotal, posturing, and easy to do." (4)

"Those of us who work with theory are all familiar with the use of humiliating ad hominem anecdotes to generalize about strange or threatening kinds of thinking; we have all heard colleagues distort or amplify weak sentences or underdeveloped terms in particular cases to make a general point -- for example, 'It's just bad sociology about trivial objects.'" (5)

"The backlash against cultural studies is often a displaced expression of discomfort with work on contemporary culture. Attaching cultural studies is frequently a way of expressing a kind of fatigue with issues of 'race, class, and gender.'" (5)

"I am not saying that work in cultural studies is always what I wish it were or that these anxieties are without foundation. But since attacks on cultural studies cloak many kinds of worthy and unworthy suspicion and ambivalence, it behooves us to try to say what these hidden feelings are and to disaggregate them from one another." (5)

"One ground of my argument concerns an area of professional life for which virtually no faculty member is trained: collegiality. I mean by this term a cluster of issues relevant to the public management of professional life: the inevitable vulnerability that comes from having ideas and doing work in public; the strangeness of negotiating the odd intimacy of institutional association with colleagues we know well yet barely know; the hierarchies of professorship that mediate, though it's never clear how, the personal relationships among faculty members; the interpersonal effort involved in the daily grind of professorship; the strain of optimistic institution building in this difficult context." (5)

"because humanists traditionally accrue value by being intimate with the classics (literary and theoretical), those who think through popular materials and contextualize them through atypical kinds of rhetoric threaten to degrade the value of intellectual life in general and of the humanities in particular." (6)

"surely we must constantly monitor the impulse to assume that knowledges we would not want to have or to save are not worth having, saving, or disseminating." (6)

"To the extent that this phenomenon is generational, why are those on the bottom (the assistant professors and lecturers and graduate students) so often made to seem like the cause of the discomfort, made to feel responsible for building bridges to the tenured, when they have virtually nothing to stand on, much worse prospects for professional life than anyone else ever had? (And why are these same populations being blamed for the star system?)" (7)

"students come more and more to see their task in graduate school as achieving a critical position, a finishes look, the aura of authorship, and the mastery of an original archive; less and less do they seem to have the privilege of being sudents, by which I mean nostalgically to remember the time when there was time enough to do a lot of research that panned out in nothing but knowledge -- no dissertation, no publication, no conference paper." (8)

"the problem of selling oneself on a virtually imaginary market had made many graduate students feel threatened and impatient and has mixed up questions about inclination and talent with the desire to be in a critical discussion and thus to be desirable to someone -- in a peer group, on a hiring committee or on an editorial board." (8)

"an environment of distrust characterizes many literature departments (and departments in other fields), and this distrust has to do with largely unworked-through differences over the relative value of archival, theoretical, and rhetorical mastery -- anxieties that the often strange and estranging work broadly defined as cultural studies intensifies." (8)

"I would rather talk about the problems of ethics, value, trust, hierarchy, and labor in academic life than use cultural studies as an alibi, one more time, for the urgency of responding to the institutional pressures of the present that have rendered so many of us bitter or angry or tired or cynical or perhaps simply confused about what to do in this moment of intellectual expansion and economical downsizing in the United States academy."
