DeLillo, Don.  Valparaiso (1999).  New York:  Touchstone:  2000.

Act One

Michael:  “Word spread through the cabin in two languages.  A telling and retelling of all the little accidents, of all the misunderstandings and mishaps.  The whole daylong series.  The strangeness.” (DeLillo 17)

Interviewer:  “I got everything I need.  Just tell me what’s your name again.” (DeLillo 18)

Interviewer:  “Look into the camera.  Speak into the mike.  These are the forms of self-expression.” (DeLillo 23)

Interviewer:  “A feature-length documentary film.  A self-commenting super-vérité — okay — in which everything that goes into the making of the film is the film.  Everything that leads up to the film and flows out of the film is the film.  Including the film.  A film that what?  That consumes itself as the audience watches.” (DeLillo 36)

Interviewer:  “It’s what he wants.  It’s what brings him into being.”
Livia:  “Sleep?”
Interviewer:  “Film...”

Interviewer:  “What should I say?  That the term itself — my life — is a desperate overstatement.” (DeLillo 44)

Interviewer:  “My body is in Seattle.  My voice is in downtown Detroit.” (DeLillo 55)

Act Two

Delfina:  “I am so glad to be here.  I woke up this morning.”
Teddy:  “Feeling.”
Delfina:  “So totally unmyself.”
Teddy:  “How is this different from every other morning?”
Delfina:  “It isn’t.  Because this is my stark reality.  I can’t remember who I am.” (DeLillo 64-65)

Livia:  “I’m a little bit of everything around me.  Who am I?...” (DeLillo 71)

Delfina:  “This is a man so deep in self-estrangement he conceals his own actions from himself.” (DeLillo 87)

Delfina:  “Up to that point.  In the still center of your existence.”
Teddy:  “In the penetralia.”
Delfina:  “In the unpublished places.  The hideaways.”
Teddy:  “The hidey-holes.”
Delfina:  “Day by day.  Deepest night.  Who were you?”
Michael:  “I don’t know what that question means.  It’s a joke question.  The answer’s Boo. Because there’s no considered response that’s nearly so apt as babble.  How did I live?  Out there in the bump and run, I devised a kind of glancing man.  Picnicked with the sales managers in the sheep meadow.  For my wife, I built a husband, contractually bound.  Loved and touched.  Tossed the salad.  But who was I?  Ga ga ga ga ga.  In the seams of being, nobody.  In the final spiral strand, nobody, soul-lonely, smoke.” (DeLillo 97)

Delfina:  “What is the word that describes the condition of a man who advances bravely toward his own grueling truth?”
Teddy:  “What is the word?”
Delfina:  “Perishability.” (DeLillo 103)
