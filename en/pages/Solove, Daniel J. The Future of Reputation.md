Solove, Daniel J.  The Future of Reputation:  Gossip, Rumor, and Privacy on the Internet.  New Haven: Yale UP, 2007.  x, 236 pp.

1.  Introduction:  When Poop Goes Primetime

story of S. Korean girl whose dog pooped on subway spreads throughout internet; public shaming

Solove appears paranoid:  "Somebody you've never met can snap your photo and post it on the Internet.  Or somebody that you know very well can share your cherished secrets with the entire planet.  Your friends or coworkers might be posting rumors about you on their blogs.  The personal email you send to others can readily be forwarded along throughout cyberspace, to be mocked and laughed at far and wide.  And your children might be posting intimate information about themselves on the Web -- or their friends or enemies might be revealing your family secrets." (2) -- on the other hand, he goes on to document at least one, and often more than one, instance in which each of those things has happened.  In other words, the possibility is real; the question is perhaps how widespread this threat is, and how much we should allow it to affect our online behavior.

Solove notes that there is a "dark side" (4) to the abilities that the so-called "web 2.0" applications have given us to write and publish our thoughts freely on the internet.  Solove locates this dark side, the threat to our privacy, in gossip, in the ways that these technologies make the control of our reputations more difficult.  He doesn't pay much attention, however, to another potential threat to our privacy -- the corporate control and ownership of much of the information that we publish on the internet.

line from Lawrence Lessig cited:  "We will see that cyberspace does not guarantee its own freedom but instead carries an extraordinary potential for control." (quoted on 4) -- Lessig's sense of "control" is here specifically about the corporate uses of our personal data; Solove wants to redirect our attention to the fact that the Internet presents "not only the clash between freedom and control but also a struggle within the heart of freedom itself" (4-5), a struggle between freedom of speech and privacy, between the desire to know about other people and the desire to maintain our reputations.

"Details about many people's private lives are finding their way onto the Internet, often without the subjects' knowledge and consent." (6)

"People who act inappropriately might not be able to escape into obscurity anymore; instead, they may be captured in pixels and plastered across the Internet.  They'll be held responsible for their actions.  But perhaps responsibility cuts both ways.  Shouldn't the cyberspace norm police also have responsibilities?" (7)

legal questions that arise:  "Under existing notions, privacy is often thought of in a binary way -- something is either private or public.... But a more nuanced view of privacy suggests that this case involved taking an event that occurred in one context and significantly altering its nature -- by making it permanent and widespread." (7)

Solove is concerned about a new kind of digital panopticism, in which we no longer require a Big Brother looking over our shoulder, because we are all constantly watching ourselves; "should people's social transgressions follow them on a digital rap sheet that can never be expunged?" he asks (8).  A worthy question; the Internet creates an environment in which a person can become famous overnight, but more often than not that fame is based on something that the person would just as soon forget, preferring that it be allowed to pass into obscurity.  And then there are further wrinkles:  the Numa Numa guy, however much he might wish to erase that performance, did put it out there himself; the Star Wars kid, by contrast, made a video that he never expected anyone else to see.  And further:  the sex partners of the Washingtonienne didn't write about it themselves, but were written about.  In all these cases, the Internet's ability to spread information instantly and widely, and its inability to forget, have changed the lives of these people -- people we might tend to forget are *real,* not characters -- for the worse.

Solove's rhetoric seems at first glance to bear much in common with the rash of articles worrying about the dangers that sites such as MySpace present to children and teenagers, exposing them to the "online predators" that such articles find so ubiquitous.  His concerns, however, are somewhat different.  [but different how, exactly?]

The risks that Google presents to us are not, as Solove presents, just about the traces that we leave behind from information we put out there ourselves; in fact, "data about us can be revealed by our friends or enemies, spouses or lovers, employers or employees, teachers or students... and even by strangers on the subway." (9-10, ellipsis in original)

The threats that we faced in childhood, that some stupid thing we'd done in third grade would be placed on our "permanent record," now have the potential, at least, to be real; where once the permanent record was a mostly fictional entity, used to keep kids in line, now the web's ubiquity and the odd persistence of data on it have made it real:  "An entire generation is growing up in a very different world, one where people will accumulate detailed records beginning with childhood that will stay with them for life wherever they go." (11)  Little wonder that "reputation management" systems are popping up across the web, services such as claimID that allow users to gather links to material about them across the web, owning and disowning certain aspects of their public reputations.

But perhaps some of this danger originates not from the information that's placed out there, but rather from the ways the corporations use that information.  Even scholars such as danah boyd, one of the most enthusiastic defenders of social networking systems and their uses by adults and teens alike, are concerned about the privacy implications of, for instance, Facebook's opening of its records to Google searches.  The problem for boyd is not the existence of the data, but the access to the data...

Solove seeks a balance in this book, arguing that "we must protect privacy to ensure that the freedom of the Internet doesn't make us less free," but also that we must "balance the protection of privacy against freedom of speech." (11)


Part One:  Rumor and Reputation in a Digital World

2.  How the Free Flow of Information Liberates and Constrains Us

"We're heading toward a world where an extensive trail of information fragments about us will be forever preserved on the Internet, displayed instantly in a Google search.... This data can be of dubious reliability; it can be false and defamatory; or it can be true but deeply humiliating or discrediting.  We may find it increasingly difficult to have a fresh start, a second chance, or a clean slate." (17)

historical positioning of blogs within publishing technologies -- from movable type to MovableType

"We're living in the next media revolution.  This time, we are the media." (19)

blogs as "more akin to an ongoing conversation than to a mainstream media publication or broadcast." (19)

positive sides of blogging include the ways that "bloggers have served as a critical voice to the media, uncovering blunders and omissions in many mainstream media stories" (20)

other aspects of blogging:  instant feedback

Solove notes that the Internet is "dissolving the boundaries between professional journalists and amateurs" (23), but then goes on to distinguish between so-called "citizen journalists" and "diarists," arguing that the latter is "why there's a problem" (24) -- it's not that more people are publishing, but that what they're publishing is often personal

social networking sites:  "In realspace social networks, people have different kinds of ties with others. 'Strong ties' are close connections (very close friends and relatives); 'weak ties' are looser connections (acquaintances and others with whom people might have marginal contact).  But according to the computer scientists Ralph Gross and the economist Alessandro Acquisti, social network websites 'often reduce these nuanced connections to simplistic binary relations.'" (26-27)

concerns about the level of personal information users share on MySpace and Facebook

"Given the ease at which information can be recorded and spread, there will be more instances when information we want to keep on a short leash will escape from our control." (29)

"Our reputations are forged when people make judgments based upon the mosaic of information available about us." (30); when more information becomes available, sometimes those judgments are more accurate -- but sometimes they're not

on the one hand, we want to be able to control our own reputations; on the other hand, we want unfettered access to the reputations of others

reputation as a form of social control:  "By ensuring that people are accountable for their actions, reputation gives people a strong incentive to conform to social norms and to avoid breaching people's trust." (32)

the dangers of the global village: gossip in the small town was damaging, but one could move away; now, the Internet "makes gossip a permanent reputational stain, one that never fades" (33)

paradox of reputation: "despite the fact that we talk about reputation as earned and the product of our behavior and character, it is something given to us by others in the community" (33); we believe we can control our reputations, when in fact others often have far more powerful controls over them

"we want information to flow openly, for this is essential to a free society, yet we also want to have some control over the information that circulates about us, for this is essential to our freedom as well" (35)

the Internet can be self-correcting: information moves quickly, and bad information can quickly be replaced with good; but sometimes the bad information comes to be believed, and attains a dangerous persistence

employers using Google to clear applicants often come up with personal or damaging information; but Solove uses Tribble utterly uncritically, not noting, for instance, that Tribble himself is hiding behind a pseudonym, or that he's making inappropriate personal judgments of candidates

"not everybody knows the risks of exposing themselves online.  Many individuals are teenagers and college students, who may not consider the consequences.  Moreover, many people are not simply self-disclosing in their blogs" (39), but also disclose information about others

"Blogging represents the very best that communication has to offer" (49), but it's also a potential threat to privacy

maybe as more information about everyone hits the internet, we'll be more free, and concerns about privacy will diminish; but "Maybe the future will be one that is less free, where society is both oppressive and uncontrollable, where people are vulnerable to having their reputations destroyed in an instant, where mistakes in one's past can forever thwart opportunities in one's future." (49)


3.  Gossip and the Virtues of Knowing Less

story of the Washingtonienne and other bloggers whose writings about other people have become part of those people's public record

"what about free speech? Then again, what about privacy?" (58)

"People sued to tuck their diaries away in drawers or lock them up, but now, they are sharing them with the public on the Internet." (59)

"25 percent of bloggers in the survey noted that they frequently posted very personal details on their blogs... bloggers frequently wrote about other people they knew, but 66 percent never asked the permission of those people when they did so; only 3 percent routinely requested permission" (59)

"Traditionally, it has been unusual for gossip to leap from one social circle to another, because people in one group rarely know or care about someone in a completely different group" (60), but the Internet is making such leaps commonplace

Malcolm Gladwell's _The Tipping Point_ and the role of "connectors" in social networks

the ways that information can become "sticky" or "contagious" on the Internet

"On the Internet, gossip can more readily jump the boundaries of various social circles, because all it takes is for the gossip to come to the attention of a connector blog, where it can become contagious and spread far and wide throughout cyberspace." (63)

"Gossip is essential to establishing reputations.... Gossip is a way to expose people's infringements of norms, and it is an essential tool for a community to ensure that its norms are respected." (63)

but "people often gossip in ways that don't benefit society but that instead further their own self-interest" (65)

"Perhaps is the veils on our lives were all removed simultaneously, society might collectively discard certain norms.  However, the process of changing norms is complicated, and it is far from certain that more gossip will effectuate change in norms." (65)

"The more meaningful question is not whether we should stop gossip, but how we should control it, how we should modulate its problematic effects." (65) -- is the answer for everyone to blog?  If someone says something negative about me on the internet, and I have no forum to respond, I have little recourse.  But what if I do have a forum that goes unnoticed, or if the thing someone else said about me is just much more interesting?

"more information may not necessarily lead to more accurate judgments about others.  In many cases, the disclosure of private information can lead to misjudgment based on only partial knowledge of someone else's situation" (66)

"Human judgment is imperfect; we make judgments based on fragments of information taken out of context." (67)

the complicated self -- ideas that we are different people in different contexts, playing different roles at different times in our lives

Milan Kundera:  "Any man who was the same in both public and intimate life would be a monster.  He would be without spontaneity in his private life and without responsibility in his public life." (quoted on 68)

popular mythology holds that the private self is the "true" self, the moments at which we are most genuinely "ourselves"; Solove argues that neither is really "true" in that sense, that both the private and the public self are "just dimensions in a complex, multifaceted personality, one that is shaped by the roles we play.... As a result, uncovering secrets will not necessarily reveal who people 'truly' are or enable more accurate assessments of their character.  Instead, these disclosures can often be jarring, for they display people out of the context in which others may know them." (69)

should we "actively promote" (69) our ability to play different roles at different points in our lives by protecting privacy?  Generally speaking, "society recognizes and accepts the fact that the public self is a partly fictional construct" (69).

irrational judgments made about personal traits that carry societal stigmas are obviously problematic (such as the ways that people with certain diseases can be stigmatized), but often perfectly rational judgments based on those traits can be similarly problematic

"Many norms are routinely broken, and privacy permits society to ignore these small transgressions" (71); but "privacy doesn't just allow people to flout norms; privacy itself is a set of norms about how intrusive we should be into each other's lives" (72)

recent concerns about privacy violations -- such as the wiretapping of private citizens by the government and other intrusive forms of surveillance -- are often met with an insistence that if one doesn't have anything to hide, one has nothing to fear.  Solove disagrees; even when we aren't up to something that we don't want the public to see, we still crave privacy:  "People want privacy even for their mundane daily activities.  Without privacy, people might experience significant unease at everything they do, constantly wondering how others might interpret their actions.  Innocent behavior might appear suspicious out of context." (72)

privacy is necessary to allowing people "to recover from past mistakes and misconduct" (72) -- in some circumstances, we may need to know about others' pasts, such as their criminal records, in order to know whether to trust them, but it is often true that people should be allowed to "rehabilitate themselves and start new, more productive lives" (73); need to "balance the value of rehabilitation against the value of the disclosure of the information" (73)

in weighing the right to privacy against the desire for the disclosure of information, one must consider audience -- who needs to know this? -- as well as "the purpose of the disclosure.  Disclosures made for spite, or to shame others, or simply to entertain, should not be treated the same as disclosures made to educate or inform." (74)


4.  Shaming and the Digital Scarlet Letter

trends in Internet shaming of the bad behavior of individuals leading to "the cyberspace equivalent of mob justice" (78)

Solove's concerns about public shaming include the possibility that the information posted might be fabricated or flawed; "If CNN ran the story, we'd trust that the facts were checked and verified; we'd believe that CNN would not deliberately fabricate the story" (78).  But, he argues, bloggers aren't required to adhere to such professional ethics or standards.  This may not be the best possible analogy, however, as it has repeatedly been demonstrated of late that mainstream news outlets do less and less original reporting and more and more passing on of stories picked up from other outlets...

in some cases, people frustrated that others are getting away with a crime attempt "to take the law into their own hands and expose the wrongful conduct" (83).  Sometimes the results are good.  But is this a good thing overall?

understanding the violation of norms: norms are usually not formalized into law, but are rather informal rules of etiquette or acceptable behavior; as such, they can't be enforced in the same ways that laws can.  Norms are also somewhat unstable, shifting and changing over time.

"Norms enable us to get along smoothly and to resolve many situations that could lead to disputes./ But norms can be bad things, too.  FOr instance, they can be riddled with double standards." (85)  They can also be quite hypocritical, especially when they revolve around common but private behaviors such as sex.

So Solove's question: "just how much norm enforcement [do] we want"? (86)

cases:  Bitter Waitress's Shitty Tipper Database; Holla Back NYC; Don't Date Him Girl

history of shaming punishments in England & US; such punishments declined as US grew in size and life in urban areas became relatively anonymous; recent return of shaming punishments by governments (such as publishing photos of men who solicit prostitutes)

benefits of online shaming: "In a world of increasingly rude and uncivil behavior, shaming helps society maintain its norms of civility and etiquette" (92); shaming "also gives people a chance to fight back" (92) -- internet shaming as means for individuals to force corporations to provide decent service

"Shaming can empower people to enforce laws and social norms that increasingly go unenforced because our vast and impersonal society allows transgressors to remain obscure and anonymous, unaccountable for their vile conduct" (94)

on the other hand: internet shaming is permanent; once shamed in cyberspace, the shame remains

"For the philosopher Martha Nussbaum, shame is more than simply an expression of displeasure at particular acts; rather, it is an enduring reduction in social status to a lesser kind of person" (94)

"Shame has a way of alienating people, inhibiting their ability to rehabilitate and reintegrate themselves into the community." (95)

shaming can also extend far out of proportion to the perceived crime:  "disproportionate punishment risks creation of an oppressive society.  Even desirable norms can be enforced to an excessive degree" (95)

internet shaming fails to follow any rules of due process

"Norm enforcers can be mistaken.  There are no rules and procedures to ensure that the Internet norm police are accurate in their assessments of who should be deemed blameworthy." (97)

also, shaming can very quickly tip over into bullying: see the Star Wars kid

"One problem with shaming is that we can't always agree on who deserves to be shamed and to what degree.  While we all agree on some norms, we don't agree on many others.  Who controls what norms are being enforced?" (98)

moreover, shaming can also turn into vigilantism: see the Nuremberg Files and the shootings of doctors who perform abortions

"Without the threat of shame, people would transgress norms, making society less orderly and civil.  But as some of these incidents demonstrate, although shaming is done to further social order, it paradoxically can have the opposite result.  Instead of enhancing social control and order, Internet shaming often careens out of control.  It targets people without careful consideration of all the facts and punishes them for their supposed infractions without proportionality.  Shaming becomes uncivil, moblike, and potentially subversive of the very social order that it tries to protect." (102)


Part Two:  Privacy, Free Speech, and the Law

5.  The Role of Law

increasing sense in contemporary culture that privacy is already dead, and that there's nothing than can (or should?) be done to protect it

history of sensationalist journalism and increasing intrusions of the media into privacy; conflicting responses:  Godkin essentially argued that there was no mode of formal recourse; Warren and Brandeis "argued that the law could evolve to protect privacy.  They explained that the law already protected 'the more general right of the individual to be let alone,' and that this right could be the foundation for new protections for privacy to develop" (109) -- recommended a tort remedy

types of legal approaches:  the libertarian approach is hands-off, arguing that information is meant to be free, and thus does little to protect privacy; the authoritarian approach uses censorship to control the circulation of information, but at the expense of free speech, and thus "in a broad and crude manner that is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution." (113)

need to seek middle ground:  "A more moderate role for the law to take would be to help shape the norms that govern the circulation of information.... The law should ensure that people better understand the dramatic difference between gossip offline and online" (113)

"The law currently protects the flow of personal information about people's reputations through defamation law as well as the invasion-of-privacy torts spawned by Warren and Brandeis's article.  For this body of law to work effectively, however, two seemingly contradictory changes must be made.  First, the law must be broadened significantly -- especially the law of privacy.  Second, the law must be restricted so that the lawsuit is employed only rarely to redress privacy trespasses." (113)

dueling in history of modes of vindicating reputation, gives way to lawsuits:  "If there's a moral to the story of the demise of dueling and the rise of litigation, it is that every society needs some mechanism to resolve reputational harms.... With the rise of the modern economy, honor ceased to be the core of a person's reputation, and dueling faded into obscurity." (117)

defamation law: libel and slander; "For the law to kick in, a statement must be false and it must harm a person's reputation.  The person making the defamatory statement must be at fault -- if she reasonably believed the fact to be true, then she isn't liable.  It is up to the plaintiff to prove that the statement was false, and the speaker doesn't have to vouch for its truth." (118)

defamation law is "a relatively ineffective tool to protect against the spread of rumors on the Internet" (118)

invasion of privacy torts include "(1) intrusion upon seclusion; (2) public disclosure of private facts; (3) false light; and (4) appropriation." (119)

"public disclosure of private facts... provides a remedy when somebody widely discloses another person's private information.... In contrast to defamation, which makes people liable for spreading falsehoods, the public-disclosure tort remedies the dissemination of truths" (119)

however, "in the name of free speech, privacy law (as well as defamation law) has been severely restricted.  Second, the law of privacy is being held back by narrow understandings of privacy" (119)

"Lawsuits can chill speech.... The effect of too many lawsuits resembles that of the authoritative approach, impeding speech far too much.  But without the threat of lawsuits, online speakers have no legal incentive to remove posts or to resolve disputes informally.  And for egregious cases, we want the law to be involved." (120)

plaintiffs often punished in lawsuits by being forced to attach their names to the damaging information; "Most people should be allowed to sue without having their real names appear in the record.  This would allow people to seek a remedy for the spread of information about them without having to increase the exposure of the information." (121)

"people resort to the law because they want a way to vindicate their reputations.... If we find a way to allow people to vindicate themselves, express their anger, and have the damage patched up at least to some degree, we can avoid a lot of litigation.... The goal of the law should be to encourage the development of norms and to spur people to work out their disputes informally." (122)

"The law should encourage websites to develop a process by which problems can be adjudicated and resolved, where bad information can quickly be taken down, and false statements can be corrected." (123)

"How can we maintain the law as a credible threat yet keep lawsuits in check?  I propose a requirement that a plaintiff first exhaust informal mechanisms for dealing with the problem.  If the defendant agrees to remove the harmful information from the website, then this should be the end of the lawsuit unless the victim can demonstrate that merely taking down the offensive speech won sufficiently patch up the harm." (123)

also recommends alternative dispute resolution (arbitration/mediation) and the limitation of damages

"In other words, the law should case a wider net, yet have a less painful bite." (124)


6.  Free Speech, Anonymity, and Accountability

"If the law's goal is to restrict the spread of information when it causes harm, how can the law do so without unduly infringing upon freedom of speech?" (125)

First-amendment limits placed on defamation law by Supreme Court: defamation torts largely in place for "private individuals," but not for public figures, who must prove "actual malice" in order to win their cases

clashes as well between law of privacy and free speech; how to reconcile both needs?

test of "newsworthiness": speech must be of public, legitimate concern to be protected

Solove argues that "protecting privacy -- and restricting free speech in some cases -- can actually advance the reasons why we protect free speech in the first place" (129)

reasons free speech is important:  individual autonomy -- but privacy is important to autonomy, too: "Privacy permits individuals to express unpopular ideas to people they trust without having to worry how society will judge them or whether they will face retaliation" (130)

also democracy -- but privacy can similarly support the public exchange of ideas on policy matters by making speakers comfortable with expressing themselves

the promotion of truth -- but "truth isn't the only value at stake.  Truth must be weighed against other values.... Much true information is trivial and useless.  The value of the quest for the truth depends upon what information one is seeking." (132)

Solove indicates that "Information is of public concern when 'the public has a proper interest in learning about it'.... What is of interest to most of society is not the same question as what is of legitimate public concern.... Ample public curiosity doesn't make a piece of gossip newsworthy, as such interest can stem from a hunger for prurient entertainment instead of from a desire to learn about the news and current events" (132).  Though the Larry Clark affair is much too recent to have been included in Solove's analysis, one might ask which side his argument supports in this case.  Is is a "legitimate" public concern to know whether an elected representative who made public comments denouncing the sexual indiscretions of another elected official is himself guilty of sexual indiscretions?  Who is to determine whether the public's interest in a story is "proper"?

"When journalists protect confidential sources, they engage in a balancing determination, sacrificing the public's ability to verify for the importance of protecting confidentiality.  Public verifiability is not sacrosanct; it can be outweighed by privacy interests." (134)

on balancing the freedom to speak about one's own life with the privacy rights of those who play a part in it:  the law should "pay attention to who is divulging the secret.  It is essential for autonomy that a person be able to talk about her own life -- even when what she's describing isn't newsworthy" (134); but at the same time, the law must also require the speaker "to be careful not to damage the lives of others" (135), by protecting their identities

importance of anonymity to free speech must be balanced with accountability of speakers:  "When anonymous, people can without risk be much nastier and more uncivil in their speech" (140)

"anonymity can make lying easier; and the identification of speakers can help significantly in deterring them from spreading false rumors and can allow us to locate and punish the source of such rumors" (141)

"anonymity inhibits the process by which reputations are formed, which can have both good and bad consequences.  Not having accountability for our speech can be liberating and allow us to speak more candidly; but it can also allow us to harm other people without being accountable for it" (141)

"As the tension between anonymity and accountability demonstrates, along with the tension between privacy and free speech, the choice isn't as simply as one between freedom and constraint.  Rather, it is a choice that involves freedom on both sides." (141-42)

tradeoffs between accountability and anonymity are difficult; on the one hand, we want to enable folks to be free to write and comment online; on the other hand, we need to be able to assess the reputations of those doing so.  Solove proposes a system of "traceable anonymity," in which "we preserve the right for people to speak anonymously, but in the even that one causes harm to another, we've preserved a way to trace who the culprit is" (146).  Such a system raises questions, however:  if an anonymous speaker is traceable, how can we preserve that anonymity against malicious outings?  Solove says "the key is for the law to allow the unmasking of anonymous people when they engage in harmful speech about others.  But people shouldn't be unmasked too readily.  The law must draw a careful line between when it is appropriate to unmask an anonymous speaker and when it isn't" (147).  This line, however, seems almost impossible to draw: if the systems are in place whereby a speaker *can* be unmasked, it seems almost certain that some hacker will find a way to penetrate the system

Solove mostly means this system to apply to the accountability of ISPs and other forum hosts, including bloggers, in requiring them to address the privacy complaints of those whose reputations are harmed by anonymous comments posted in those forums.  Currently, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is interpreted to suggest that ISPs and other such forum hosts are immune from lawsuits because they are considered neither the speaker nor the publisher of any defamatory speech made by commenters on their sites.  Solove suggests a middle-ground interpretation of Section 230, which, as he argues, "might be read to grant immunity only before the operator of a website is alerted that something posted there by another violates somebody's privacy or defames her.  If the operator of a website becomes aware of the problematic material on the site, yet doesn't remove it, then the operator could be liable" (154).  This approach "seeks to encourage people to work out the problem informally first, by spurring bloggers to remove harmful comments.  If this informal process fails, a lawsuit can be brought, but otherwise, the law would function to serve as an impetus to get people to work it out among themselves" (154).

Solove does indicate some awareness of the potential of such an interpretation to chill speech, however, when he notes that forum hosts "might become too cautious and remove comments too quickly" (155), but he doesn't follow through with this note as far as one might like.  For instance, he might have explored the ways that hair-trigger responses to DMCA takedown notices have at moments not served the protection of intellectual property but instead assisted in the corporate infringement on the rights to free speech.  While takedown requests from individuals who feel themselves defamed or feel their privacy rights violated by speech about them on the Internet are unlikely to produce the same kinds of knee-jerk responses, largely because individuals and their lawyers present a far smaller threat than do major corporations, the possibility of such infringements on free speech remain.  Solove's middle-ground proposals go a long way toward mediating the rights to anonymous speech and the accountability that such speech should maintain, but there is no firm solution to be arrived at here.

"we staunchly protect expression even when it can cause great damage because free speech is essential to our autonomy and to a democratic society.  But protecting privacy and reputation is also necessary for autonomy and democracy... it is a balance with liberty on both sides of the scale -- freedom to speak and express oneself pitted against freedom to ensure that our reputations aren't destroyed or our privacy isn't invaded" (159-60).


7.  Privacy in an Overexposed World

Is anything really private today?  The law only considers "information that is completely secret" (161) to be private; anything "exposed to others" (161) is considered public.  How must we rethink our notions of privacy in the age of the Internet?

judicial reasoning that "there can be no privacy in that which is already public" (i.e., not occuring in a private place where no one else can see it) creates a binary understanding of privacy.  Solove points to "the difference between what is captured in the fading memories of only a few people and what is broadcast to a worldwide audience" (163), but the law insists that anything exposed even to a very small portion of the public has become public.

(connections to recent debate on AOIR about scholarly readings of blogs and whether they need to go through IRBs?)

"Today, privacy goes far beyond whether something is exposed to others.  What matters most is the nature of the exposure and what is done with the information.  There is a difference between casual observation and the more indelible recording of information and images" (164-65).  There is also a difference in "the degree of anonymity we expect in our everyday activities" (165) -- just because we're in public doesn't mean that everyone knows who we are

there is also the question of context, as "there are different social norms for different situations, and broadcasting matters beyond their original context takes away our ability to judge the situation appropriately" (165), as well as the fact that many of our daily activities "take place in the twilight between public and private" (166)

"Unless we rethink the binary notion of privacy, new technologies will increasingly invade the enclaves of privacy we enjoy in public." (166)

issues surrounding "video voyeurism" and whether one can have a reasonable right to privacy even in a public or semi-public space (like a locker room)

on the other hand, there are the cases of the dog poop girl and the subway flasher -- should the law recognize their privacy and give them the right to sue?

"It is difficult to stop shaming unless we protect privacy in public.  Doing so doesn't mean absolute protection, just a limit on certain kinds of uses and disclosures.  People can still snap pictures and turn them over to the police.  People should be deterred, however, from taking matters into their own hands by placing the photos online." (168)

Facebook's news feed protest "is especially interesting because it had nothing to do with the exposure of new information," only how that information was disseminated (169)

"Privacy can be violated not just by revealing previously concealed secrets, but by increasing the accessibility to information already available.  The desire for privacy is thus much more granular than the binary model recognizes." (170)

distinction between confidentiality and secrecy -- just because one makes a piece of information known to some people doesn't mean it should be freely distributed to everyone; US courts hold "that we must assume the risk that we'll be betrayed" (174) while UK courts have a stronger view of confidentiality

concerns about confidentiality extend to commercial relationships; "The companies you share information with are also frequently not understood to owe you a legal duty of confidentiality" (175)

need to develop a stronger sense of confidentiality, without over-legislating against gossip

when is information no longer a "secret"? not a matter of the raw numbers of people who know, but rather when information leaps beyond a social circle:  "Information should be considered private if it remains within a confined group -- even if that group is rather large.  Once it has traversed too many social circles, then it is no longer private." (179)

implications for blogging:  "Even if information is already circulating orally as gossip among a few people, putting it online should still be understood as a violation of privacy -- even if it is read only by people within one's social circle" (181), precisely because the Internet makes real the threat that this information could leap the social circle into broader consumption

argues that only the original poster of info online should be held liable, even if his/her readership is small, and the info only comes to light when another blogger with a bigger readership picks the story up; the second blogger would never have found the story if the first hadn't posted it:  "A line must be drawn at cyberspace; once information is out on the Internet, those subsequently discussing and disseminating it should not be liable" (182)

"Those repeating the information should not be liable for damages -- but they should be required to remove at least the last names of the harmed individuals if asked." (182)

danger of too much confidentiality: can impede the spread of true information

uses copyright law as model for how information might be controlled???  acknowledges the "balance of freedom and control" in copyright law that "has been the subject of considerable debate and controversy" (186), but doesn't really explore the difference between the control of information for profit-making purposes and the control of information for purposes of maintaining personal privacy

"The appropriation tort thus protects against my using your name or picture to advertise my products, but it allows me to use your name and picture when writing about you.  I can write you unauthorized biography, for example, and you will not be able to sue me for appropriation." (187) -- thus, the appropriation tort does not protect against the publishing of information about or pictures of a person online

"But are my recommendations too radical for our law?  After all, law develops rather conservatively.  It wears a bow tie, and it doesn't like change." (188)


8.  Conclusion: The Future of Reputation

"We are witnessing a clash between privacy and free speech, a conflict between two important values that are essential for our autonomy, self-development, freedom, and democracy.  We must do something to address the problem, but if we err too much in one direction or the other, the situation could become much worse." (190)

"improvements are needed in the existing law for this [middle-ground] approach to work effectively" (190)

argues in the end for the development of blogosphere norms:  "The law is a puny instrument compared with norms." (194)

hopes for the development of "a code of ethics.  People should deleted offensive comments quickly if asked.  People should ask permission before speaking about others' private lives.  Someone who speaks about another person's private life without her consent should take steps to conceal her identity.  People should avoid posting pictures of other people without getting their consent.  People should avoid Internet shaming." (195)

and:  "The law must make the boundary between online and offline more salient in people's minds." (196)

is this just a generational problem?  students' exposure on Facebook/MySpace

EFF's guide to blogging safely

the power of architecture of websites: the default privacy settings on most social network sites "encourage people to expose a lot of information with very little thought about the consequences" (200); changing the default settings might help a lot

social network sites also see social circles as binary -- friend/not friend -- rather than as granular

under federal law, a prospective employer who conducts a background check on an applicant and then uses the results of that background check in the decision not to hire them must disclose that information to the applicant, so that they have the opportunity to explain; employers are currently under no obligation to reveal their googling of applicants, however, and so applicants get no opportunity to explain or point out errors in the information found
