Preface

"What these structures all variously entail is the cultural impulse to preserve and interpret, or better yet, to interpret and preserve... Cultures save themselves.  And they save themselves according to a host of little-noticed assumptions that are particularly important to stop and think about in the present moment, as saving increasingly becomes a function of today's new media -- something that gets done 'on' or 'to' the hard drive of a server, for instance, and with a digital device." (Gitelman xi-xii)


Introduction: Media as Historical Subjects

"I begin with the truism that all media were once new as well as the assumption, widely shared by others, that looking into the novelty years, transitional states, and identity crises of different media stands to tell us much, both about the course of media history and about the broad conditions by which media and communication are and have been shaped." (Gitelman 1)

"history comes freighted with a host of assumptions about what is important and what isn't -- about who is significant and who isn't -- as well as about the meanings of media, qualities of human communication, and causal mechanisms that account for historical change." (Gitelman 2)

"The art historical object from long ago -- a vase, painting, or sculpture -- is still art today, however much tastes may have changed.  But the scientific object from long ago -- curing by leeches, the ether, a geocentric solar system, and so on -- isn't science at all.... Which kind of historical subjects are media?  Are they more like nonscientific or scientific objects?" (Gitelman 3-4)

"media are also historical because they are functionally integral to a sense of pastness.  Not only do people regularly learn about the past by means of media representations -- books, films, and so on -- using media also involves implicit encounters with the past that produced the representations in question." (Gitelman 5)

"inscriptive media represent, but the representations they entail and circulate are crucially material as well as semiotic." (Gitelman 6)

"the stability and savability of inscriptions are qualities that arise socially as well as perceptually.  The defining fixity of print as a form of inscription, for example, turns out to have arisen as a social consequence of early modern print circulation as much as from any perceptual or epistemological conditions inherent to printed editions in distinction from manuscript copies." (Gitelman 6)

"Media are more properly the results of social and economic forces, so that any technological logic they possess is only apparently intrinsic.  That said, I have also resisted taking a reductively antideterministic position.  At certain levels, media are very influential, and their material properties do (literally and figuratively) *matter*, determining some of the local conditions of communication amid the broader circulations that at once express and constitute social relations." (Gitelman 10)

"'the data of culture': records and documents, the archivable bits of irreducible pieces of modern culture that seem archivable under prevailing and evolving knowledge structures, and that thus suggest, demand, or defy preservation.  History in this sense is no less of a cultural production in the past than it is in the present." (Gitelman 12)

"When media are new, when their protocols are still emerging and the social, economic, and material relationship they will eventually express are still in formation, consumption and production can be notably indistinct." (Gitelman 15)

"I execute commands to save my data files -- texts, graphics, sounds -- but in saving them, I have no absolute sense of digital savability as a quality that is familiarly material." (Gitelman 19)

"A computer engineer can explain how digital files really are created and saved, but I would insist that the vernacular experience of this creatability and savability makes at least as much difference to the ongoing social definitely (that is, the uses) of new, digital media." (Gitelman 20)
