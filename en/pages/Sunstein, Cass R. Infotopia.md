Introduction: Dreams and Nightmares

"For aggregating information, the Internet offers great risk as well as extraordinary promise.  Both the risk and the promise come from the fact that with the Internet, it is easy to obtain the views and even the collaboration of hundreds, thousands, and conceivably even millions of people. Every day, like-minded people can and do sort themselves into echo chambers of their own design, leading to wild errors, undue confidence, and unjustified extremism.  But every day, the Internet also offers exceedingly valuable exercises in information aggregation, as people learn a great deal from the dispersed bits of information that other people have.  Many people are curious, and they often seek out perspectives that run counter to their own." (Sunstein 8)

"A key question is this:  Does deliberation actually lead to better decisions?  Often it does not.  Group members may impose pressures on one another, leading to extremism or to a consensus on falsehood rather than truth.  The idea of 'groupthink,' coined by Irving Janis, suggests that groups may well promote unthinking uniformity and dangerous self-censorship, thus failing to combine information and enlarge the range of arguments." (Sunstein 12)

"What is the best way to ensure innovation?  Open source software also pools the information and even the creativity of numerous people -- not always because of economic incentives, but because people like to contribute to improvements." (Sunstein 15)


Chapter One:  The (Occasional) Power of Numbers

"Why is Google so good at finding what a particular searcher wants?  The answer is that it knows what *most* searchers want, and most people want what most people want." (Sunstein 23)

"The accuracy of judgments of statistical groups is best explained by reference to the Condorcet Jury Theorem... The Jury Theorem says that the probability of a correct answer by a majority of the group increases toward 100 percent as the size of the group increases.  The key point is that groups will do better than individuals, and big groups better than little ones, so long as two conditions are met:  Majority rule is used, and each person is more likely than not to be correct." (Sunstein 25)

the dark side:  "Suppose that each individual in a group is more likely to be wrong than right.  If so, the likelihood that the group's majority will decide correctly falls to *zero* as the size of the group increases." (Sunstein 28)

"we can identify two situations in which the judgment of a statistical group will be wrong.  The first are those in which group members show a systematic bias.  The second, a generalization of the first, are those in which their answers are worse than random.  The failures of statistical judgments in these circumstances have strong implications for other social failures as well -- as individual blunders, with respect to actual or likely facts, are transformed into blunders by private and public institutions." (Sunstein 33)

"In the real world, we must often choose between a small group of people, each with a large amount of information, and a large group of people, each with a small amount of information.  Sometimes the large group is worse." (Sunstein 38)


Chapter Two:  The Surprising Failures of Deliberating Groups

"In theory, a deliberating group should perform well even if some of its members are error-prone.  Deliberation, in the form of an exchange of information and reasons, might well bring them into line.  In a deliberating group, everyone should end up knowing what each individual knows, and the whole should be at least the sum of its parts." (Sunstein 48)

"No one doubts that deliberative processes have often done a lot of good.  The question is whether some such processes do better than others, and whether it is really sensible to celebrate deliberation in the abstract." (Sunstein 52)

"A key effect of group interaction is a greater sense that the postdeliberation conclusion is correct -- whether or not it actually is." (Sunstein 55)

"Second, deliberation usual promotes uniformity by decreasing the range of views within groups." (Sunstein 55)

"Suppose that a key goal of deliberation is to promote a sense of *legitimacy*: an appreciation, by many people, that they have been able to participate in the process accompanied by a belief, on the part of all concerned, that the decision is right.  Because deliberation increases uniformity and confidence in the outcome, it might be favored even if it produces errors." (Sunstein 56)

"When like-minded people cluster, they often aggravate their biases, spreading falsehoods." (Sunstein 58)

Habermasian valuation of deliberation, rational discourse, the "ideal speech situation," in contrast with the actual manifestations of deliberation in public bodies, which often degenerate into "a parody of deliberation even if everyone is allowed to talk" (Sunstein 72)


Chapter Three:  Four Big Problems

"deliberating groups typically suffer from four projects.  They amplify the errors of their members.  They do not elicit the information that their members have.  They are subject to cascade effects, producing a situation in which the blind lead the blind.  Finally, they show a tendency to group polarization, by which groups go to extremes.  Each of these problems threatens to dash the hopes of those who want deliberating groups to take advantage of dispersed information." (Sunstein 75)

biases and heuristics that lead to errors:  availability heuristics, familiarity, salience, framing effects, representativeness heuristics, conjunction errors, hindsight bias

"with group discussion, individual errors are usually propagated rather than eliminated, and amplification of mistakes is quite likely." (Sunstein 80)

"*Hidden profiles* has become the standard term for the accurate understandings that groups could obtain but do not.... Hidden profiles are in turn a product of the *common knowledge effect*, through which information held by all group members has far more influence on group judgments than information held by only a few members." (Sunstein 81)

"Some group members are 'cognitively central,' in the sense that their knowledge is shared with many other group members.  What they know, other people know as well.  A cognitively central group member is defined as one who possesses information in common with all or most group members.  But other group members are 'cognitively peripheral,' in the sense that their own information is uniquely held; what they know is known by no one else.  Well-functioning groups need to take advantage of cognitively peripheral people.  But it turns out that cognitively central people usually have a disproportionate influence in discussion, and they also show higher levels of participation in group deliberations." (Sunstein 85)

"Strange but true:  If someone tells you something you already know, you are apt to like that person, and yourself, a bit better as a result." (Sunstein 88)

informational cascades and group polarization

"The good news is that search engines turn up an extraordinary range of material, often with varied and competing perspectives.  This indeed is the most important part of the story.  But there is less good news, and it is also important:  Some searches produce the same set of opinions, not diversity.  Indeed, personalized searches, which are now possible, ensure that Google can give you the kinds of things in which you, in particular, have previously shown an interest." (Sunstein 97)


Chapter Four:  Money, Prices, and Prediction Markets

"A central advantage of prediction markets is that they give people the right incentive to disclose the information they hold." (Sunstein 104)

"In a prediction market, the existence of incentives greatly increases the likelihood that each investor will prove to be right.  Those without information will not participate; those with a lot of information will participate a great deal." (Sunstein 105-106)

"traditional practices are often the congealed product of earlier informational or reputational cascades." (Sunstein 125)

"In many cases, traditions last not because they are excellent, but because influential people are averse to change and because of the sheer burdens of transition to a better state." (Sunstein 125)

"Human beings usually assimilate new information in a way that confirms their view of the world; this phenomenon is called *confirmation bias*." (Sunstein 139)


Chapter Five:  Many Working Minds:  Wikis, Open Source Software, and Blogs

"*collaborative filtering*, the process of figuring out what you're likely to like by investigating the tastes of minds that are like yours." (Sunstein 147)

wikis, open source software, and blogs "offer distinct models for how groups, large or small, might gather information and interact on the Internet.  They provide important supplements to, or substitutes for, ordinary deliberation.  They might even be seen as central places in which deliberation is now occurring -- with increasing social importance." (Sunstein 148)

"Wikipedia grows out of an old-fashioned, less imaginative, and now-abandoned project, Nupedia, an early effort to create a free encyclopedia on the Internet.  Nupedia was structured like an ordinary encyclopedia, with expert writers and a system of peer review.  Unfortunately, if also unsurprisingly, the process of writing Nupedia proved exceptionally slow.  As a result, Jimmy 'Jimbo' Wales, the founder of Nupedia, was persuaded to supplement it with a more informal project, in which ordinary people could write and edit entries." (Sunstein 151)

"Because of their openness, speed, and flexibility, some people believe that blogs will come to replace, at least in part, the discussions of law and politics that can now be found in traditional academic journals.  The very fact that an analysis can be done in an hour or a day might seem to make such journals obsolete." (Sunstein 185)

but "the very problems that infect deliberation can be found on the blogosphere, too.  The world of blogs is pervaded by the propagation of errors, hidden profiles, cascades, and group polarization." (Sunstein 186)


Chapter Six:  Implications and Reforms

"If deliberating groups are to draw on the successes of markets, open source software, and wikis, then the solution is simple:  *Groups should take firm steps to increase the likelihood that people will disclose what they know*." (Sunstein 201)
