Preface

spectrum of families from Spectaculars to troubled

on the troubled end of the spectrum:  "Though excessive television watching is a common symptom of family pathology, these families are not likely to find that watching less TV is going to make enough difference in their lives.  They have too many other basic problems to deal with first" (Winn ix)

"television's powerful pull on children and parents alike makes it far harder to control than most parents recognize" (Winn x)

"The idea prevails, perhaps because of this book's negative title, that my answer to parents' problems with television is to promote its elimination altogether.  But that has never been my purpose.  I know that my most persuasive arguments will never make television go away, nor would I want it to.  I am not an enemy of the medium nor do I believe it is devoid of value. // My aim, instead, is to promote a new way of thinking about TV.  I believe that if parents understand the medium's power and look squarely at the ways it affects their children and their family life, they can begin taking the necessary steps to deal with it successfully" (Winn x)
 

Part I:  The Television Experience

1.  It's Not *What* You Watch

"Concern about the effects of television on children has centered almost exclusively upon the *content* of the programs children watch.... The very nature of the television experience apart from the program content is rarely considered" (Winn 3) -- see McLuhan

"It is very easy to overlook a deceptively simple fact:  one is always *watching television* when one is watching television rather than having any other experience" (Winn 3)

"What are the effects upon the developing human organism of spending such a significant proportion of each day engaged in this particular activity?  How does the television experience affect a child's language development, for instance?  How does it influence the nascent imagination?  Creativity?  Is the child's perception of reality subtly altered by steady exposure to television unrealities?" (Winn 4)

"What about effects on the family?  How does the availability of television affect the ways parents raise their kids?  Are new child-rearing strategies being adopted and old ones discarded because the television set is available for relief?  How does watching television for several hour each day affect the child's abilities to form human relationships?  What happens to family life as a result of family members' involvement with television?" (Winn 5)

"given the amount of time most children spend at the single experience of television watching, the question of whether the stuff they learn from programs is helpful or harmful pales in importance when compared to questions about the experience itself and the time devoted to it -- whether *that* is helpful or harmful" (Winn 5)

"children may acquire valuable information about wildlife from watching nature programs on television.  But if the hours of watching fine nature documentaries affects children's relationship to *real-life nature*, if a walk in the woods begins to seem a bit boring when compared to the experience of lions pouncing on unsuspecting zebras in the Serengeti Plains, it begins to seem unprofitable to dwell on the educational value of those programs" (Winn 5)

"while all children come to enjoy watching television, some children seem to *need* television far more than others and seem to be willing to watch endlessly" (Winn 6) -- [throughout, this is made to seem a failing of the child, or a failure of the parents to regulate the medium, rather than evidence that something else may be wrong that is driving the child to television for relief]

"often, it appears, it is the very child the parents perceive as having more problems in general -- the shy or passive child, or the aggressive child, the child who has trouble getting along with other children.  It is not hard to understand why a troubled or vulnerable child might form a deeper attachment to the safe, undemanding pleasures of television viewing" (Winn 6) -- [then why is the answer to take the child's TV away, rather than to figure out what's actually wrong?]

"Even when other family members are lukewarm about television, one avid television fan in a family is sufficient to create a serious television problem.  It is more difficult to engage in family activities and maintain a strong family feeling when one member would always rather be watching television" (Winn 6-7)

"the somewhat hypnotic effect TV has on many people, and the difficulty they have tearing themselves away from the tube" (Winn 7)

quoting sociologist Urie Bronfenbrenner:  'Turning on the television set can turn off the process that transforms children into people.'

"overwhelming proof of a causal relationship between TV viewing and declines in various academic areas, in creativity, in social participation of all sorts" (Winn 9)

"Children need to develop family skills in order to become successful parents themselves some day....  There is every indication that television has a destructive effect upon family life, diminishing its richness and variety" (Winn 11)

"As adults watch television, their own present and past experiences, dreams, and fantasies come into play, transforming the material they see into something reflecting their own particular inner needs.  Young children's life experiences are limited.  They have barely emerged from the preverbal fog of infancy.  It is disquieting to consider that hour after hour of television watching constitutes a *primary* activity for them" (Winn 13)

"To a certain extent children's early television experiences will serve to dehumanize, to mechanize, to make less real the realities and relationships they encounter in life" (Winn 13)


2.  A Changed State of Consciousness

"Considering the infinite variety of children's personalities and behavior patterns, there is a remarkable sameness of expression among television-watching children" (Winn 17)

"Parents' observation of the passive nature of their children's television viewing often underlies their deepest anxieties about television's effects.  The word 'passivity' comes up again and again in talks with parents about their children's television experiences" (Winn 20)

"Does the fact that parents prefer their child to read, for instance, rather than to view television merely reflect our society's preference for verbal rather than visual experience?" (Winn 21)

"A child, for instance, who comes home from nursery school each day in a wretched frams of mind, fussing and demanding attention, may provoke his or her parents to investigate what's happening at school; often serious problems are uncovered in this way, even though the child may never complain about school or the teacher, and may even claim that everything is fine at school" (Winn 23) -- [what about what's happening at home???]

"What, then, *is* the child's state of consciousness while watching television?  It is clearly not sleep.  Is it something other than waking?  We are all familiar with drug-induced states of consciousness.  Is the television-viewing child on some kind of trip, then, from which a transitional period of bad behavior is required before reentering the real world?" (Winn 25)

"Surely if television viewing can be a trip, then, like the drug experience, it can become an addiction as well" (Winn 25)


3.  The Power of the Medium

"A number of perceptual factors unique to the television experience may play a role in making it more fascinating and addictive than other vicarious experiences" (Winn 26)

"Thus, the material perceived on television may take on an air of unreality, a dreamlike quality.  Indeed, similar visual-motor conflicts are frequently described as features of many drug experiences by users" (Winn 27-28)

quoting a psychoanalyst:  "Parents don't like their kids watching television because it's so entrancing and captivating that it falls into the category of those forbidden, mildly damaging, and enjoyable experiences like masturbation.  They don't like to see their kid tune out, sitting in the corner and playing with himself.  And just so, they don't like to see him sitting in the corner looking at the google-box for hours on end.  It's too pleasurable" (Winn 30-31)

section title:  Cookies or Heroin?  [!!!]

"The word 'addiction' is often used loosely and wryly in conversation.... In these cases the word 'addiction' is used jokingly to denote a tendency to overindulge in some pleasurable activity" (Winn 32)

"is there a kind of television viewing that falls into the more serious category of destructive addiction?"

"The entry into another world offered by reading includes an easily accessible return ticket.  The entry via television does not" (Winn 32)

"The television habit distorts the sense of time.  It renders other experiences vague and curiously unreal while taking on a greater reality for itself.  It weakens relationships by reducing and sometimes eliminating normal opportunities for talking, for communicating" (Winn 33)

"heavy television viewers can never be sated with their television experiences.  These do not provide the true nourishment that satiation requires, and thus they find that they cannot stop watching" (Winn 33)

"In spite of the potentially destructive nature of television addiction, it is rarely taken seriously in American society.  Critics mockingly refer to television as a 'cultural barbiturate' and joke about 'mainlining the tube'" (Winn 36)

"As psychologists Robert Kubey and Mihaly Csikczentmihalyi concluded in their book about the television experience: 'A long-helf habit becomes so ingrained that it borders on addiction.  A person may no longer be watching television because of simple want, but because he or she virtually has to.  Other alternatives may seem to become progressivly more remote.  What might have been a choice years earlier is now a necessity'" (Winn 38)


4.  The Experts

medical establishment's slowness to recognize the threat posed by television watching

physical effects of television watching:  obesity, diabetes, decline in overall physical fitness, sleep disorders, low-back pain


5.  Television and Violence:  A Different Approach

on assumption that viewing violent content produces violent behavior:  "Before presenting an argument that goes against this strongly held belief, I feel obliged to make a disclaimer:  I'm not saying that watching violence on television is good for children, nor am I saying that it's acceptable for kids to watch violent programs.  My argument is about whether violent programs on television are responsible for the host of social ills people connect them with, and in particular, whether watching such programs makes children behave violently" (Winn 45)

"Violent programs are bound to influence many kids' ideas of what life is like, and may cause them to take on some superficial yet unattractive verbal and physical mannerisms" (Winn 45)

"The inexorable focus on violent programming obscures greater problems that the medium brings into the home" (Winn 46)

"For families, focusing attention exclusively on this single issue gives the idea that violent programming is the major problem parents face with television.  It allows parents to consider program content alone in making decisions about their kids' TV viewing, and diverts attention from the larger questions of how much time their kids watch, and what they are missing as a result" (Winn 46)

"no direct, causal link has ever been demonstrated between the violence that millions of kids watch regularly on television, and the horrifying sort of behavior reflected in crime statistics.... While numerous studies show that kids act more aggressively after watching an hour of TV murder and mayhem, they show an increase in the ordinary forms of childhood aggression -- pushing, shoving, hitting, and being verbally abusive -- not rape or murder or any of the serious crimes included in crime statistics" (Winn 47)

"The experiment shows a significant connection between heavy TV viewing and aggression, and might have been useful in encouraging parents to cut down on their kids' hours in front of the tube.  But the press construed the results as content-related: that watching less violence on TV was what made kids less aggressive" (Winn 50)

"Here are two alternative hypotheses that might explain why watching a lot of television would lead to increased aggression and cutting down would reduce aggression:
     1.  Television viewing substantially reduces that crucial set of experiences known as play.  Several animal experiments have demonstrated the role of play in mitigating aggression.  Could this not be true for humans as well?...
     2.  During the six-month period when TV was reduced substantially, there were suresly some effects on parent-child relations at home.  Perhaps the parents were more accessible to the kids during the hiatus.  Perhaps they had to socialize them more.  Whatever those changes were, they could have led to a decrease in aggressiveness among the kids" (Winn 51)
 
"If parents are compelled to recognize that the problem resides not in the sock-bam-pow content, but in the great amounts of time their kids spend watching, then the solution is not so easy" (Winn 51-52)


Part II:  Television and Early Childhood

6.  Television for Tots

TeleTubbies; Sesame Street

"Although children exhibit certain small gains in number and letter recognition as a result of _Sesame Street_, their language skills do no show any significant or permanent gains as they progress through school" (Winn 59)


7.  Television and the Brain

"The possible effects of heavy involvement with television on a child's brain development clearly do not lie in the direction of brain-rot or 'brain-mush'; several generations of children raised watching television have come to maturity showing no signs of a downward trend in overall intelligence.  And yet there *are* aspects of brain development that may be significantly altered by regular exposure to the television experience, though they cannot be measured by means of a simple IQ test" (Winn 67)

"For adults, nonverbal mental activities carry connotations of relaxation from the difficulties of logical thinking and promise a much desired achievement of peace and serenity.  But for young children in their formative, language-learning years, any extended regression into nonverbal mental functioning such as the television experience offers is a potential setback" (Winn 73)
