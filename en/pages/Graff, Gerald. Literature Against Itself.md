Graff, Gerald.  Literature Against Itself:  Literary Ideas in Modern Society.  Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 1979.

1.  Culture, Criticism, and Unreality

book about “our ways of talking about literature” (Graff 1), and particularly the “recent turn” and where we’ve gone wrong

“One of the defining aspects of the current situation is the penetration of literary ideologies and paradigms into areas heretofore impervious to them — with a consequent loss of oppositional tension between literary culture and general society.” (Graff 1-2)

appropriation of adversary stances (alienation, irony, etc) into mass culture; transformation of modernism from revisionary to entrenched ideology

defense of New Critics; degradation of “reality” (and thus of mimesis) in contemp

“The very act of denying all ‘naïve’ realisms presupposes an objective standpoint.  Such denials can only be stated in language, and language, it seems, is an incorrigible realist.” (Graff 11) — assumes language’s transparency!

formalist & visionary critics:  literature self-reflexively about itself; or reality = literature

“uncertainty of modern theorists about the relationship of literature to the objective world” (Graff 17); “insistence that reality takes its orders from consciousness more than consciousness takes its orders from reality” (Graff 17)

new “moralism” of political-critical response

“Realistic and objectivistic ways of thinking about language and thought are persistently identified with things nobody would want to be associated with if he could help it:  with amoral science, positivism, mechanism, venal commercial calculation, stifling respectability, inhuman technology, class exploitation, imperialism, manipulative propaganda and advertising, bureaucracy, regimentation, in short, just about everything anybody ever found to dislike about ‘bourgeois culture,’ as characterized in the crudest sociological stereotypes.” (Graff 24)

(is he completely missing a distinction between mimesis and objectivity?)

“By rebelling against mimesis, literary culture aims to repudiate technological thinking.  Yet the real technological thinking may be the kind that politicizes the mental world in just this way, drawing a sharp antithesis between individual autonomy and imitation of preestablished models.” (Graff 27)

2.  The Myth of the Postmodern Breakthrough

reads postmodernism as continuation of romantic/modernist project, not break

questions both the historical “religion of art” sprung out of romanticism and the avant-garde dismantling of that religion

romantic redefinition of objectivity as intersubjectivity; read as precipitating “a radical cultural relativism” (Graff 38) — Graff repeatedly sees the dismantling of a unitary reality as producing total relativism, in which all perspectives are equal; he can see no middle ground, in which multiple perspectives might be valid while some maintain more validity than others

philosophical crisis in modern culture in which “reason” comes to be seen as mechanical, dehumanizing

[Graff argues, ironically, that postmodernist and poststructuralist theories are a form of “technologized thinking” (Graff 27) born out of their mistaken sense that Enlightenment patterns of thought, especially their veneration of “reason,” were dehumanized and mechanical.]

“From the position that the literary symbol means no more than itself (autotelic art), it is only a step to the position that literature has no meaning (anti-teleological art), or that its meaning is totally indeterminate and ‘open’ to interpretation.” (Graff 49) — this is a rhetorical structure that Graff uses repeatedly, presenting the perfectly reasonable idea and saying that from there “it is only a step to” the totally unreasonable idea, when in fact the two don’t really correlate.  On top of which, he here compares two incongruous positions — to say that the meaning of a text is open to interpretation is not at all to say that it has no meaning

3.  The Politics of Anti-Realism

“cultural radicalism” replaces political radicalism of sixties; suggests that “there exists a parallel or correspondence between psychological, epistemological, esthetic, and political categories of experience” (63)

revolt against realism tied to revolt against “a unitary psychology of the self” (Graff 66)

“Among the evidences of elitism and repressive rationalism in established humanistic studies, none has been more widely assailed than the academic ideal of objective interpretation.  If their imagery can be taken seriously, some recent commentators see the strangulation of art by critical objectivity as a kind of literary counterpart of imperialism or industrial pollution.” (Graff 78)

an embarrassingly (and seemingly intentionally) naïve defense of objectivism; an absolute refusal to acknowledge the thoroughly situated nature of all knowledge

methodology as technics:  “Ever since the New Critical discovery that almost any work of literature could be read as a complex of paradoxes and ironies, critical ‘methodology,’ whatever other purposes it has served, has been an instrument for generating new ‘readings’ — and thus new publications.” (Graff 97) — theory as a reading and writing machine

4.  English in America

Richard Ohmann, English in America:  A Radical View of the Profession (1976): presents what Graff criticizes as “the indoctrination theory of English” (104)

“Just as much contemporary literary theory drains literature of its referential substance, much of our educational thinking views content either as an irrelevance or as a repressive threat to the selfhood of the learner.” (Graff 126)

5.  What Was New Criticism?

“The method of close textual analysis was a response on one side to those who dismissed literature as a frivolity and on the other side to those who defended it in terms which rendered it frivolous.” (Graff 141)

works throughout the chapter to counter accusations of New Criticism’s over-rationalism and formalism, instead suggesting that NC paved the way for structuralism; ignores, however, NC’s universalizing humanist ethos

6.  How Not to Talk About Fictions

“fiction” as critical strategy for neutralizing truth-claims in literature

gets all wrapped around the axle about whether thematic statements in literature can be taken as propositional, in ways that seem to me to miss the point; of course they’re propositional; it’s just that they’re no more or less propositional than non-fictional statements — all statements of belief are written by and in ideology, and thus are always “fictional” in the sense of mythic

7.  How Not to Save the Humanities

“it has become difficult to distinguish the defenders of humanistic ideals from the attackers” (Graff 181)

long reading of Northrop Frye

“The literary way of talking about fictions pretends that no such unrefusable facts exist.  This way of talking has endowed not only literature but all communication and discourse with an unaccountability that would be terrifying if its implications were taken seriously.  No problem seems more pressing in the humanities right now than the radical unaccountability that infects its talk.” (Graff 204)

8.  Babbitt at the Abyss

postmodern fiction carries to an extreme the modernist project of breaking with realism; “The weakness of much postmodern fiction lies in its inability or refusal to retain any moorings in social reality.” (Graff 209)
