Readings, Bill. The University in Ruins. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1996.


1.  Introduction

"a more general uncertainty as to the role of the University and the very nature of the standards by which it should be judged as an institution." (Readings 1)

"the impulse behind this book is not simply to argue that the University needs to recognize that new theoretical advances in particle physics or literary studies render old paradigms of study and teaching obsolete.  Nor is this book simply another attempt to engage with the web of conflicting and often contradictory sentiments that currently surround the University.  Rather, I want to perform a structural diagnosis of contemporary shifts in the University's function as an institution, in order to argue that the wider social role of the University as an institution is now up for grabs." (Readings 2)

"the University is becoming a transnational bureaucratic corporation, either tied to transnational instances of government such as the European Union or functioning independently, by analogy with a transnational corporation." (Readings 3)

"the general thrust of my argument that the notion of culture as the legitimating idea of the modern University has reached the end of its usefulness may be understood to apply to the natural sciences as well as to the humanities, although it is in the humanities that the delegitimation of culture is most directly perceived as a threat." (Readings 5)

"The University, I will claim, no longer participates in the historical project for humanity that was the legacy of the Enlightenment: the historical project of culture." (Readings 5)

"The central figure of the University is no longer the professor who is both scholar and teacher but the provost to whom both these apparatchiks and the professors are answerable." (Readings 8)

"on the surface, this book makes a rather simple argument.  It claims that since the nation-state is no longer the primary instance of the reproduction of global capitals, 'culture' -- as the symbolic and political counterpart to the project of integration pursued by the nation-state -- has lost its purchase.... This shift has major implications for the University, which has historically been the primary institution of national culture in the modern nation-state." (Readings 12)

"the ways in which University administrators, government officials, and even radical critics now more and more often speak of the University in terms of 'excellence' instead of in terms of 'culture'... why the term 'excellence' is becoming so important to policy documents in higher education." (Readings 13)

"The University no longer has to safeguard and propagate national culture, because the nation-state is no longer the major site at which capital reproduces itself.  Hence, the idea of national culture no longer functions as an external referent toward which all the efforts of research and teaching are directed." (Readings 13)

"What gets taught or researched matters less than the fact that it be excellently taught or researched." (Readings 13)

"the radical claims of Cultural Studies display rather more continuity than might be expected with the redemptive claim that underpinned the literary model of culture, however much they oppose its institutional forms.  I argue that the institutional success of Cultural Studies in the 1990s is owing to the fact that it preserves the structure of the literary argument, while recognizing that literature can no longer work -- throwing out the baby and keeping the bathwater, as it were." (Readings 16-17)

"the question of how the University is to be evaluated, and it argues for the need for a philosophical separation of the notions of *accountability* and *accounting*.  I argue that it is imperative that the University respond to the demand for accountability, while at the same time refusing to conduct the debate over the nature of its responsibility solely in terms of the language of accounting (whose currency is excellence)." (Readings 18)

"the aim of pedagogy should not be to produce autonomous subjects who are supposedly made free by the information they learn, which is the Enlightenment narrative.  Rather, by relinquishing the claim to join authority and autonomy, the scene of teaching can be better understood as a network of obligations... teaching is a question of justice and not a search for truth" (Readings 19)

"the way in which we can rethink the modernist claim that the University provides a model of the rational community, a microcosm of the pure form of the public sphere.  This claim for an ideal community in the University still exerts its power, despite its glaring inaccuracy -- evident to anyone who has ever sat on a faculty committee." (Readings 20)

"the University becomes no longer a model of the ideal society but rather a place where the impossibility of such models can be thought -- practically thought, rather than thought under ideal conditions... the University becomes one site among others where *the question of being-together is raised*" (Readings 20)


2.  The Idea of Excellence

"'Excellence' is rapidly becoming the watchword of the University, and to understand the University as a contemporary institution requires some reflection on what the appeal to excellence may, or may not, mean." (Readings 21)

"quality is not the ultimate issue, but excellence soon will be, because it is the recognition that the University is not just *like* a corporation; it *is* a corporation.  Students in the University of Excellence are not *like* customers; they *are* customers.  For excellence implies a quantum leap: the notion of excellence develops *within* the University, as the idea around which the University centers itself and through which it becomes comprehensible to the outside world." (Readings 22)

"Today, all departments of the University can be urged to strive for excellence, since the general applicability of the notion is in direct relation to its emptiness." (Readings 23)

"to say that excellence is a criterion is to say absolutely nothing other than that the committee will not reveal the criteria used to judge applications." (Readings 24)

"A measure of the flexibility of excellence is that it allows the inclusion of reputation as one category among others in a ranking which is in fact definitive of reputation.  The metalepsis that allows reputation to be 20 percent of itself is permitted by the intense flexibility of excellence; it allows a category mistake to masquerade as scientific objectivity." (Readings 27)

excellence "functions not merely as the standard of external evaluation but also as the unit of value in terms of which the University describes itself to itself, in terms of which the University achieves the self-consciousness that is supposed to guarantee intellectual autonomy in modernity.  Given that, who could be against excellence?" (Readings 28)

"once excellence has been generally accepted as an organizing principle, there is no need to argue about differing definitions.  Everyone is excellent, in their own way, and everyone has more of a stake in being left alone to be excellent than in intervening in the administrative process." (Readings 33)

"The contemporary advent of excellence may therefore be understood to represent the abandonment of the vestigial appeal to the *form* of culture as the mode of self-realization of a republican people who are citizens of a nation-state" (Readings 35)

"The British turn to 'performance indicators' should also be understood as a step on the road toward the discourse of excellence that is replacing the appeal to culture in the North American University." (Readings 36)

"investment follows success, so the government intervenes to accentuate differentials in perceived quality rather than to reduce them.  Thus more money is given to the high-scoring university departments, while the poor ones, rather than being developed, are starved of cash" (Readings 36)

"the appeal to excellence marks the fact that there is no longer any idea of the University, or rather that the ideas has now lost all content.  As a non-referential unit of value entirely internal to the system, excellence marks nothing more than the moment of technology's self-reflection.  All that the system requires is for activity to take place, and the empty notion of excellence refers to nothing other than the optimal input/output ration in matters of information." (Readings 39)

"we must analyze the University as a *bureaucratic system* rather than as the ideological apparatus that the left has traditionally considered it." (Readings 41)


3.  The Decline of the Nation-State

"the appeal to excellence occurs when the nation-state ceases to be the elemental unit of capitalism." (Readings 44)

"Under globalization, the state does not disappear; it simply becomes more and more managerial, increasingly incapable of imposing its ideological will as the *political* content of economic affairs." (Readings 47)

"The University becomes modern when it takes on responsibility for working out the relation between the subject and the state, when it offers to incarnate an ideal that will both theorize and inculcate this relationship.  This is its dual mission research and teaching, and if the latter has always lagged behind the former in terms of real service performed for the state, this is hardly surprising." (Readings 53)


4.  The University within the Limits of Reason

"in the contemporary University of Excellence, the model of the academy rules with the process we know as 'professionalization,' bringing about the increasing integration of functions so that research is non-referential.  That is to say, the content of the research comes to matter less and less, as research is ever more indistinguishable from the mere reproduction of the system." (Readings 55)


5.  The University and the Idea of Culture

"for Fichte, pedagogy is pure process.  The teacher does not transmit facts (which can be better learnt from books, the reading of which leaves more room for autonomous reflection) but rather does two things.  First, the teacher narrativizes the search for knowledge, tells the story of the process of knowledge acquisition.  Second, the teacher enacts the process, sets knowledge to work.  What is thus taught is not facts but critique -- the formal art of the use of mental powers, the process of judgment." (Readings 67)

"the instrument by which ethnicity was to be linked to culture -- especially in the anglophone world -- is the invention of the notion of *national literature*." (Readings 69)


6.  Literary Culture

"For both Leavis and Arnold, the idea of literary culture could synthesize the pre-industrial organic community and the technology of mass communication so as to establish a culture that would be *transparent to itself*." (Readings 81)

"Fish appeals to a horizon of rational institutional consensus rather than a cultural identity.  He describes the profession as a deliberative institution that is autonomous and self-regulating, an argument that works only at the price of a certain circularity: the interpretative community determines what counts as university discourse, but the identity of that community is itself only constituted by such acts of determination." (Readings 83)

"In the United States the idea of literary culture has been, appropriately in a republican democracy, historically structured by the notion of the *canon* rather than of the *tradition*."  (Readings 83)

"Whereas Leavis offered his disciples a tradition, the New Critics offered a way of reading." (Readings 84)

"The New Critics decidedly argued against historical scholarship and positioned the artwork as essentially autonomous, capable of evoking a response without extraneous information to guide interpretation." (Readings 84)

"What we are experiencing today in departments of literature in the United States is not so much a revision of the canon as a crisis in the *function* of the canon." (Readings 85)

"Nonetheless, the teaching of literature without reference to a canonical structure seems very hard to imagine, so that curricula continue to be structured, and jobs advertised, in reference to historical fields that are no longer held to be valid by many active researchers." (Readings 85)

"in the University of Excellence, knowledge tends to disappear, to be replaced as a goal by facility in the processing of information: something should be known, yet it becomes less and less urgent that we know what it is that should be known." (Readings 86)

"The emergence of critical practices that question the status of the literary and pay attention to popular culture is not the cause of the decline of literature but its effect.  Such practices become possible once the link between the nation-state and its virtual subjects, the link that the University's idea of culture (be it philosophical or literary) has historically served to forge, is no longer the primary ground of a generalized subjectivity." (Readings 87)


7.  Culture Wars and Cultural Studies

interdisciplinary programs "signal the end of 'culture' as a regulatory ideal that could unity community and communication so as to allow the analogy between the university and the modern state to function." (Readings 89)

"Either we seek to defend and restore the social mission of the University by simply reaffirming a national cultural identity that has manifestly lost its purchase (the conservative position), or we attempt to reinvent cultural identity so as to adapt it to changing circumstances (the multicultural position).  A third option is to abandon the notion that the social mission of the University is ineluctably linked to the project of realizing a national cultural identity, which is tantamount to ceasing to think the social articulation of research and teaching in terms of a *mission*." (Readings 90)

"Current developments in the humanities in the West seem to be centered on two major phenomena.  On the one hand, there is the decline in the power of the University over the public sphere, with the concomitant elimination of the intellectual as a public figure.  Perhaps surprisingly, I shall argue that this is not necessarily bad news." (Readings 91)

"The human sciences can do what they like with culture, can do Cultural Studies, because culture no longer matters as an *idea* for the institution." (Readings 91)

"The call to move beyond the University outside academicism is not a response to an act of repression *by* the University; it is a response to the repressed *of* the University itself." (Readings 91)

"If everything is signifying practice, then the study of signifying practice is the study of anything at all; rather than a specific discipline, Cultural Studies would appear to be the refusal of all disciplinary specificity." (Readings 98)

"What allows Cultural Studies to occupy the entire field of the humanities without resistance is their very *academicization of culture*, their taking culture as the object of the University's desire for knowledge, rather than as the object that the University produces.  Culture ceases to mean anything *as such*; it is dereferentialized." (Readings 99)

"the story of exclusion does not provide an alibi, when the denunciation of exclusions becomes the only way to understand our abiding sense of nonparticipation *despite the fact that we are no longer excluded*.  We are no longer excluded, not because racism, sexism, and class difference have come to an end.  They manifestly have not.  Rather, we are no longer excluded because, in the strong sense of the word that the Idealists gave it, *there is no longer any culture to be excluded from*." (Readings 103)

"For Bourdieu, ideology organizes cultural forms within a system that is relatively autonomous of economic determination, but nonetheless it organizes them *according to an economic logic*.  This permits a sociological reading of culture as a relatively independent economy in which prestige takes the place of the money form as the unit of value." (Readings 108)

"what is proposed is not an alternative to the system but the more equal redistribution of capital *within* the system, which Guillory thematizes as increased 'access' to or 'accessibility' of cultural goods." (Readings 109)

"the decline of the nation-state means that culture is no longer a matter of the inclusion or exclusion of a subject in relation to a cultural center, or even of degrees of exclusion.  Hence the problematic of participation, since we can no longer tell a story of liberation as the passage from the margins to the center, as the entry into the gates of subjecthood.  As academics know very well, the position of enunciation is peripheral: the center is silent.  By this I mean that in order to speak in today's academy one is constrained to assume a position of marginality.  So even conservatives have to tell the story of their own marginalization from culture in order to speak for themselves." (Readings 111-12)

"We need to ask what it means that the holders of cultural power need to portray themselves as unorthodox rebels.  It seems to me that the conservative jeremiads are motivated by the fact that their authors feel the emptiness of the cultural power they hold.... The cultural right is not rebelling against its exclusion from the center but against the exclusion *of* the center, its reduction." (Readings 114)

"The relentless self-marginalization of both sides is a self-blinding, a refusal to recognize that the stakes in the game have changed, that the center actually *does not speak*, that the privileged position of enunciation is not that of the subject who participates in culture." (Readings 114-15)

"Instead of subject positions, we should speak of singularities that appear as peripheral in relation to a virtual cultural center that is indifferent to them as subjects (in a way that the nation-state was not).  In other words, we can write 'excellence' at the center of the diagram where once there was 'culture'." (Readings 117)


8.  The Posthistorical University

"the question of value becomes more significant than ever, and it is by raising value as a question of *judgment* that the discourse of excellence can be resisted.  Evaluation can become a social question rather than a device of measurement." (Readings 119)

"Where excellence brackets the question of value in favor of measurement, replaces questions of accountability or responsibility with accounting solutions, I shall argue that holding open the question of value is a way of holding open a capacity to imagine the social otherwise." (Readings 119-20)

"the critique of culture as an ideology becomes obsolete, since there is no outside to cultural ideology.  Culture no longer hides anything; there is nothing behind culture for ideology critique to find" (Readings 120)

"Rather than posing a threat, the analyses performed by Cultural Studies risk providing new marketing opportunities for the system." (Readings 121)

"we should seek to turn the dereferentialization that is characteristic of the posthistorical University to good advantage.  That is to say, we should try to think what it may mean to have a University that has no idea, that does not derive its name from an etymological confusion of unity and universality." (Readings 122)

"We need no new identity for the University, not even the supplement will save us.  Rather we need to recognize that the dereferentialization of the University's function opens a space in which we can think the notions of community and communication differently." (Readings 124)

"I would be inclined to argue that the University of Excellence is one in which a general principle of administration replaces the dialectic of teaching and research, so that teaching and research, as aspects of professional life, are subsumed under administration." (Readings 125)

"Professionalization deals with the loss of the subject-referent of the educational  experience by integrating teaching and research as aspects of the general administration of a closed system: teaching is the administration of students by professors; research is the administration of professors by their peers; administration is the name given to the stratum of bureaucrats who administer the whole.  In each case, administration involves the processing and evaluation of information according to criteria of excellence that are internal to the system." (Readings 126)

"we have to think how to reimagine the notion of community itself.  Hence I shall argue that, far from community being the locus of unity and identity, the question of proximity of thinkers in the University should be understood in terms of a *dissensual community* that has relinquished the regulatory idea of communicational transparency, which has abandoned the notion of identity or unity." (Readings 127)

"In these terms, the University becomes one place among others where the question of being-together is posed, rather than an ideal community.  My call is for a more radical and uncomfortable dissensus even than that proposed by Gerald Graff's call to 'teach the conflicts.'  For behind Graff's laudable desire to displace the monologic authority of disciplinary discourse lies a desire for final consensus, the consensus that would permit the determination and transmission of 'the conflict' as a unified object of professorial discourse." (Readings 127)

"Rather than offering new pious dreams of salvation, a new unifying idea, or a new meaning for the University, I will call for an institutional pragmatism.  This pragmatism recognizes that thought begins where we are and does away with alibis.  By thinking without alibis, I mean ceasing to justify our practices in the name of an idea from 'elsewhere,' an idea that would release us from responsibility for our immediate actions.  Neither reason, nor culture.  Neither excellence, nor an appeal to a transcendence that our actions struggle to realize, trying as we may to justify our deeds and absolve ourselves.
     Such a pragmatism, I shall argue, requires that we accept that the modern University is a *ruined* institution." (Rather 129)

"Those in the University are called upon to judge, and the administration will do it for them if they do not respond to the call." (Readings 130)

"what is required is a simultaneous recognition that the question of evaluation is finally both unanswerable *and* essential.  That is to say, unanswerability is no excuse for ignoring the question." (Readings 132-33)

"This engagement should lead to a number of important questions:  Who am I to judge?  To whom is the judgment addressed?  What difference does that judgment make?  What is the judge claiming to judge?  What is the significance of the criteria implied by this judgment?
     As the nature of these questions indicates, I am arguing that the entire judgment is itself delivered not as a statement of fact but precisely as a *judgment*, to be judged by others in its turn." (Readings 133-34)


9.  The Time of Study:  1968

"In a sense, part of what happened in 1968 as revolution happens now as student apathy, which is another name for consumerism" (Readings 137)

"nothing in their education encourages them to think of themselves as the heroes of the story of liberal education, embarking on the long voyage of self-discovery.  What they are engaged in is *self-accreditation*, preparing for the job market" (Readings 138)

"What I am arguing for is the possibility that the students of 1968 imagined a University without redemption.  Such a vision of the University implies that students are not simply intellectuals or managerial professionals in waiting.  Rather, the University implies the time of pedagogy: a thought or study in excess of the subject, which rejects the metanarrative of redemption." (Readings 145)


10.  The Scene of Teaching

"What is at stake here is what I hinted at earlier:  the *value* in teaching.... In the University of Excellence, the problem of value is bracketed, and statistical evaluation (of the measure of excellence) is presumed to provide definitive answers that then feed into funding, resources, and salary decisions." (Readings 150-51)

"In order to open up the question of pedagogy we do not need, therefore, to *recenter* teaching but to *decenter* it.  By the decentering of the pedagogic situation I mean to insist that teaching is not best understood from the point of view of a sovereign subject that takes itself to be the sole guarantor of the meaning of that process, whether that subject is the student, the teacher, or the administrator.  Decentering teaching begins with an attention to the *pragmatic scene of teaching*." (Readings 153)

"My aim, then, is an anti-modernist rephrasing of teaching and learning as sites of *obligation*, as loci of *ethical practices*, rather than as means for the transmission of scientific knowledge.  Teaching thus becomes answerable to *the question of justice*, rather than to the criteria of truth." (Readings 154)

"the scene of teaching should be understood as a radical form of dialogue" (Readings 154)

"The common narrative that underlies these three accounts of the function of education argues that the goal of education is the achievement of a certain mimetic identity by the student: either as replication of the professor or as replication of a place in the system." (Readings 157)

"The student-teacher relation is not one of magisterial domination, nor is it one of dyadic fusion in which mutual understanding would serve as an end in itself" (Readings 159)

"What I would like to suggest is that we recognize that, with the decline of the nation-state, the University has become an open and flexible system and that we should try to replace the empty idea of excellence with the empty name of Thought.  The first difference between the two emptinesses is that Thought, unlike excellence, does not masquerade as an idea.... And a second difference, proceeding from this, is that Thought does not function as an answer but as a *question*.  Excellence works because no one has to ask what it means.  Thought demands that we ask what it means, because its status as mere name -- radically detached from truth -- enforces that question." (Readings 159-60)

"The other speaks, and we owe the other respect.  To be hailed as an addressee is to be commanded to listen, and the ethical nature of this relation cannot be justified.  We have to listen, without knowing why, before we know what it is that we are to listen to." (Readings 162)

"The question of the University cannot be answered by a program of reform that either produces knowledge more efficiently or produces more efficient knowledge.  Rather, the analogy of production itself must be brought into question: the analogy that makes the University into a bureaucratic apparatus for the production, distribution, and consumption of knowledge." (Readings 163)

"The ideological content of the knowledges produced in the University is increasingly indifferent to its functioning as a bureaucratic enterprise; the only proviso is that such radical knowledges fit into the cycle of production, exchange, and consumption.  Produce what knowledge you like, only produce more of it, so that the system can speculate on knowledge differentials, can profit from the accumulation of intellectual capital." (Readings 163-64)

"The question, then, is how we can raise the question of accountability as something that *exceeds* the logic of accounting.  The exponential growth in the commodification of information itself, thanks to new technologies, renders the current situation even more acute." (Readings 164)

"Doing justice to Thought, listening to our interlocutors, means trying to hear that which cannot be said but that which tries to make itself heard." (Readings 165)


11. Dwelling in the Ruins

"my argument is less concerned with the precise disciplinary shape that the University of the twenty-first century will assume than with what that shape will *mean*, which is to say, how it will be given meaning as an institutional system." (Readings 166)

"If my preference is for a thought of *dissensus* over that of consensus -- as I shall argue in the next chapter -- it is because dissensus cannot be institutionalized." (Readings 167)

"This is not in itself any reason to abandon projects for change or innovation.  Far from it.  But what is required is that we do not delude ourselves as to their significance, that we do not satisfy ourselves with rebuilding a ghost town." (Readings 169)

"We have to recognize that the University is a *ruined institution*, while thinking what it means to dwell in those ruins without recourse to romantic nostalgia." (Readings 169)

"The University is not going to save the world by making the world more true, nor is the world going to save the University by making the University more real.  The question of the University is not that of how to achieve a stable or perfect relation between inside and outside, between the ivory tower and the streets.  So, let us treat the University as we treat institutions." (Readings 171)

"To say that we cannot redeem or rebuild the University is not to argue for powerlessness; it is  to insist that academics must work without alibis, which is what the best of them have tended to do." (Readings 171)

"thinking, if it is to remain open to the possibility of Thought, to take itself as a question, must not seek to be economic.  It belongs rather to an economy of waste than to a restricted economy of calculation.  Thought is non-productive labor, and hence does not show up as such on balance sheets except as waste." (Readings 175)

"What I am calling for, then, is not a generalized interdisciplinary space but a certain rhythm of disciplinary attachment and detachment, which is designed so as not to let the question of disciplinarity disappear, sink into routine.  Rather, disciplinary structures would be forced to answer to the name of Thought, to imagine what kinds of thinking they make possible, and what kinds of thinking they exclude." (Readings 176)

"the loosening of disciplinary structures has to be made the opportunity for the installation of disciplinarity as a *permanent question*." (Readings 177)


12.  The Community of Dissensus

"Anyone who has spent any time at all in a University knows that it is not a model community, that few communities are more petty and vicious than University faculties... And yet the story persists." (Readings 180)

"We can only agree to disagree if we can establish agreement concerning what it is that we are disagreeing about, and we can only establish communication if we can ascertain that we are in communication without first communicating that fact.  Hence all problems of communication, any differences of idiom, must be presumed to be merely secondary to, or parasitical upon, a fundamental clarity of communication -- an ideal speech situation." (Readings 182)

"Derrida's powerful readings of the Western philosophical tradition are marked by his insistence that every attempt at communication is attended by a foundational violence (the reduction of the Other to the status of addressee) and by a structurally implicit failure of representation." (Readings 184)

"the question of the community that the University harbors needs to be phrased differently than it is in the modernist model.  We need to think about a community in which communication is not transparent, a community in which the possibility of communication is not grounded upon and reinforced by a common cultural identity." (Readings 185)

"it is noteworthy how often intellectuals tend to forget about the position of the listener in favor of worrying solely about the speaking position or the position of enunciation." (Readings 185)

"A distinction must be drawn between the political horizon of consensus that aims at a self-legitimating, autonomous society and the heteronomous horizon of dissensus.... To preserve the status of the social bond as a question is to tolerate difference without recourse to an idea of identity, whether that identity is ethnic ("we are all white, we are all French"), or even rational ("we are all human").  It is to understand the obligation of community as one to which we are answerable but to which we cannot supply an answer." (Readings 187)

"the political as an instance of community is a sharing that does not establish an autonomous collective subject who is authorized to say 'we' and to terrorize those who do not, or cannot, speak in that 'we.'  A dissensual community would thus be a development of the social bond as a necessity of sharing, of community.  However -- and this is a crucial restriction -- necessity and community cannot themselves be made the object of a consensus." (Readings 188)

"The desire to know fully our responsibility to others is also the desire for an alibi, the desire to be irresponsible, freed of responsibility.  Our responsibility to others is thus inhuman in the sense that the presumption of a shared or common humanity is an irresponsible desire to know what it is that we encounter in the other, what it is that binds us." (Readings 189)

"We are left, then, with an obligation to explore our obligations without believing that we will come to the end of them." (Readings 190)

"The utopia of self-transparency, of a society immediately present to itself in which all members communicate unrestrictedly with all of the others all of the time and without misunderstanding or delay -- the German Idealist fantasy of the Greek *polis* -- has not been realized.  And this is not because of technical limitations but because of technical success." (Readings 190)

"the University will have to become one place, among others, where the attempt is made to think the social bond without recourse to a unifying idea, whether of culture or of the state.  In the University, thought goes on alongside other thoughts, we think beside each other.... Working out the question of how thoughts stand beside other thoughts is, I believe, an act which can push the impulse of Cultural Studies beyond the work of mourning for a lost idea of culture that needs political renewal." (Readings 191)

"The University's ruins offer us an institution in which the incomplete and interminable nature of the pedagogic relation can remind us that 'thinking together' is a dissensual process; it belongs to dialogism rather than dialogue." (Readings 192)
