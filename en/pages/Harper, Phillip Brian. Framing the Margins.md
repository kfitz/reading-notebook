1.  Introduction:  The Postmodern, the Marginal, and the Minor

-- Postmodernism and the Decentered Subject

postmodernist theory -- subjective fragmentation; decentered self

postmodern fiction thematizes this decenteredness

a similar decenteredness in pre-postmodern novels, deriving from social marginality and political disenfranchisement of subjects

"marginalized groups' experience of decenteredness is itself a largely unacknowledged factor in the 'general' postmodern condition" (Harper 4)

postmodernist theory as beginning in exchange between Habermas ("Modernity versus Postmodernity") and Lyotard (_The Postmodern Condition_), and quickly complicated by Jameson ("Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism")

Habermas:  postmodern = embrace of or acquiescence to the "disengaged autonomy that characterizes the specialized realms of human activity in the contemporary era" (Harper 5) -- thus, postmodernism is conservative and to be avoided

Lyotard:  modernism as art which shocks, unsettles, 'presents the fact that the unpresentable [sublime] exists'; postmodernism as impulse to continually renew that shock -- 'Postmodernism thus understood is not modernism at its end but in the nascent state'

Jameson:  Lyotard's vision is too specifically "cultural"; links it to the conditions of late capitalism, in that 'aesthetic production today has become integrated into commodity production generally'; 'cultural dominant'

for Jameson, two distinctive features of postmodernism:  "the reconceptualization of the historical past as merely raw material for pastiche rather than a meaningful referent" and "'the breakdown of the [linguistic] signifying chain' such that the referential qualities of language are eclipsed by its status as a collection of 'pure material signifiers' that indicate no deeper reality" (Harper 7-8)

all three recognize fragmentation or decentering of subject as constituent of postmodern condition; but all three read this on the macro level, "leaving aside considerations of more contingent political phenomena, in particular those having to do with the social identities of the various subjects who manifest fragmentation" (Harper 9)

"Rather than conceiving that fragmentation as deriving solely from the various technological, economic, and philosophical developments that I cite above as reorienting our idea of human subjectivity in the late twentieth century, I would like to suggest that postmodern decenteredness may actually be a function of the increasing implication in the 'general' culture of what are usually thought of as socially marginal or 'minority' experiences" (Harper 11-12)

-- Social Marginality and Minor Literature

"social marginality" -- two different but related phenomena:  "(1) the formation and function of constituencies whose deviation from the practically centered 'mythical norm'... renders them relatively powerless in many social contexts; and (2) the 'shifts in position' whereby even more contingent factors are implicated in the production of power differentials" (Harper 13)

Deleuze and Guattari on minor literature as "performing a particular political function in relation to 'majority' culture" (Harper 17)

-- Modernist Alienation/Postmodern Fragmentation

connection of modern and postmodern:  postmodern as "not merely a critique but also a logical development of key modernist interests, not the least of which had to do with the questionable coherency of the human subject" (Harper 19)

"Postmodernism breaks with the formalist aestheticism that functioned to suppress modernism's full playing-out of the ramifications of experiential disjuncture, and, thus unencumbered, it continues the exploration of that disjuncture which was always implicit in modernism practice" (Harper 21)

modernist alienation:  lack of connection/separation from the Other; disjunctive between subjects

"lack of communion that founds subjective alienation is itself founded in turn on a subjective dispersal that greatly resembles postmodern fragmentation" (Harper 22)

"_Mrs. Dalloway_ thematizes the aestheticist hedge against experiential fragmentation that I have identified as a key strategy of modernism practice" (Harper 23)

"Nonetheless, I do want to show that similar instances of psychic disorientation are represented in other contemporary literary works, in which they derive not from general developments in technology or even in the economic structure but from fundamental social relations in which difference figures as a major factor" (Harper 28)


2.  Signification, Movement, and Resistance in the Novels of Nathanael West

-- Moving Violation

sets up semiotic/linguistic paradigm

-- How to Say Things with Words

divergence between human consciousness (language) and objective reality -- decenteredness

"Insofar as it obliquely 'points' to something other than itself, to something we call for the sake of convenience 'the Real,' and that constitutes the object of its function, we might say that language, *per se*, is 'decentered'" (Harper 36)

marginality as not "the space beyond the limits of a given social system; it is, rather, necessarily caught up in the very structure to which it seems exterior" (Harper 41)

marginal characters "might be said to represent the blatantly insignificant against which attempts to signify the Real can be measured: they do not represent a space outside the problematic of material signification, according to this rather structuralist outlook.  And yet, *post*structuralism teaches us that the relations that constitute a given structure are not static, and that there inheres in their instability the constant disruption of the structure, which, consequently, can no longer be 'total' in the way we generally conceive of the term" (Harper 41)

-- The System of Movement and Its Discontents

film as an attempt at "the recontainment of movement within the scheme of signification" (Harper 49)

numbers as universal language (digitization) -- key to Benjamin's 'universal equality of things'

"West, Benjamin, and Horkheimer and Adorno all comment upon a universalizing, equalizing, identifying tendency in twentieth-century mass culture, and all name film as a symbol of and commentary upon that culture" (Harper 50)


3.  Anais Nin, Djuna Barnes, and the Critical Feminist Unconscious

-- Female Self-Fashioning in Nin's "Continuous Novel"

"women's social marginality as bound up not necessarily with a wholeness existent outside the order of language, but rather with a radical incompleteness predicated upon the very gender politics that universalizes male experience" (Harper 55)

"while elsewhere the capitalist marketplace seems to *dictate* man's dismemberment of the female subject, in this particular instance it merely *enables* the man in question to perform the dual function of dismantling/dismemberment.  I would argue that the enabling role of capitalism here consists in its assimilating to a public function the conventionally private operation of men's undressing of women" (Harper 61-62)

"The power of the man's gaze is clear... it not only disrobes the woman but also dismantles her, undermines the coherence of her very self" (Harper 63)

-- Theorizing Womens' Divided Experience

Laura Mulvey and the gaze:  "thus the figure of the woman in the film is from the very first constituted as a duality:  the 'public' woman, meant for visual consumption by the male, and the 'private' woman, whose mystery the man seeks to uncover" (Harper 68)

homosociality and patriarchy:  woman's role in bringing men together

-- The Feminine Condition and Existential Angst in Djuna Barnes's _Nightwood_

"Barnes's novel thematizes two modes of self-integration:  an organic mode, in which the fragmented subject figuratively regenerates its missing parts, and a structural mode in which the fragment interrelates with other, similarly incomplete entities to form a new unity" (Harper 80)

"The point is that, for all its insistence on the non-gender-political nature of the psychic disorder that it represents, Barnes's work, along with Nin's, is informed by a feminist political unconscious that actually provides the narrative tension necessary to bind the work in a coherent whole" (Harper 89)


4.  Gwendolyn Brooks and the Vicissitudes of Black Female Subjectivity

-- Beyond the Sex/Gender System:  The Complex Construction of Feminine Identity

Foucault's notion of "subject position" -- multiple intersecting factors

"any analysis that focuses solely on one particular social category without recognizing its imbrication with other pertinent categories -- an imprication that determines its meaning in a given context -- will inevitably tend toward a universalizing of one particular social experience that is both false and obfuscating" (Harper 90-91)

-- Two Brooks "Mothers" and the Politics of Identification

"A Bronzeville Mother..." and the specificity of the maternal experience (predicated on racial difference)

"it is crucial to recognize that to say that the concept of *universality* is invalid is not to suggest that the myriad different subjectivities that constitute a society are not all impinged upon by certain social forces that tend toward *totalization*" (Harper 103)

-- _Maud Martha_ and the Issue of Black Women's Anger

"To historicize _Maud Martha_, then, is to illuminate the effects of an increasingly totalized capitalist system upong the subjects whom that system touches.  We achieve such illumination by theorizing the specificity of the experiences of Gwendolyn Brooks's black female subject, whose status as a fragmented entity both prefigures and coincides with her inscription in the postmodern condition" (Harper 115)


5.  "To Become One and Yet Many":  Psychic Fragmentation and Aesthetic Synthesis in Ralph Ellison's _Invisible Man_

-- Reflections on the Black Subject

_Invisible Man_, "in its figuration of the difficulties of the marginalized subject... suggests the degree to which individual subjectivity generally will become problematized in the postmodern era" (Harper 116)

failure of the Lacanian mirror phase -- the "intersection of psychology by politics, such that the achievement of self-image that helps constitute psychic 'stability' -- however imperfect that achievement must of necessity be -- is the privilege only of the few of optimum economic, social, and political standing, whose very success at self-definition sets them up as an impediment to the self-constitutive efforts of those less fortunate" (Harper 119)

Jameson:  modernist project as attempt to "manage" historical, social, and political

-- The Collective Entity and Individual Identity

black as "signifiers" with respect to whites

IM's insistence on 'art pour l'art' in oratory as modernist impulse -- failure to understand power of oratory to produce action

-- Aesthetic Synthesis and Collective Experience

"the aestheticization of the tension between the individual and the collective is predicated upon an aesthetics/politics dichotomy that must be false; thus, any merely aesthetic 'resolution' of that tension in favor of the individual must necessarily result in a human subject that is, ironically, radically incomplete" (Harper 137)

-- Formal Popularization/Political Cooptation

Rinehart as "unstable, liminal, uncircumscribed" (Harper 141)

"within the political-economic context of the late-twentieth-century United States, it is not fragmentation *per se* that poses the primary threat to black identity; indeed it may well represent the closest approximation we have to the 'cognitive map' that Jameson proposes is necessary for the effective negotiation of the postmodern condition" (Harper 143)

culture industry and "marketing of marginality"


6.  Postmodern Narrative/Biographical Imperative

-- Identifying a Postmodernist "Canon"

-- Donald Barthelme's Unspeakable Subject

phydical integrity subordinated to discursive processes (Harper 152)

-- Robert Coover and Metafictional Baseball

psychic fragmentation "as a function of a generalized social phenomenon that does not take into account division and stratification within the social ontology" (Harper 163)

-- Multiplicity and Uncertainty in Thomas Pynchon's _The Crying of Lot 49_

-- Maxine Hong Kingston's Postmodern Life Story

"Simply put, Kingston's book represents not the relation and concomitant establishment of autobiographical fact but rather a considered working through of the various fictive elements that actually constitute autobiographical consciousness" (Harper 172)

"The sociopolitical engagement that Kingston's work thereby manifests effectively sets it apart from the rather more canonized works of postmodern fiction with whom it nonetheless shares key narrative strategies, indicating not that Kingston's work is any the less postmodernist but rather than the criteria according to which certain works are recognized as exemplarily postmodern do not sufficiently engage the sociopolitical issues that are unavoidable implicated in the concept" (Harper 185-86)


Coda:  Categorial Collapse and the Possibility of "Commitment"

"the easy appropriability of the signifiers of certain forms of social marginality makes them prime commodities in the mass-cultural drive to market the effects of disenfranchisement for the social cachet that can paradoxically attach to it" (Harper 188)

"categorical collapse":  dangers in elision of distinctions between race and class; co-optation of terms from marginalized groups' experiences by "general public" to express its own sense of dislocation
