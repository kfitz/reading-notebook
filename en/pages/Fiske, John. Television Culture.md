Fiske, John.  Television Culture.  New York: Routledge, 1987.


CHAPTER 1: SOME TELEVISION, SOME TOPICS, AND SOME TERMINOLOGY

“In this book I work with a definition of television as a bearer/provoker of meanings and pleasures, and of culture as the generation and circulation of this variety of meanings and pleasures within society.” (Fiske 1)

book will focus on “how the textuality of television is made meaningful and pleasurable by its variously situated viewers, though it will also consider the relationship between this cultural dimension and television’s status as a commodity in a capitalist economy.” (Fiske 1)

“the simple notion that television broadcasts programs that are replete with potential meanings, and that it attempts to control and focus this meaningfulness into a more singular preferred meaning that performs the work of the dominant ideology.” (Fiske 1)

THE CODES OF TELEVISION

“The point is that ‘reality’ is already encoded, or rather the only way we can perceive and make sense of reality is by the codes of our culture.  There may be an objective, empiricist reality out there, but there is no universal, objective way of perceiving and making sense of it.” (Fiske 4-5)

“these ideological codes work to organize the other codes into producing a congruent and coherent set of meanings that constitute the common sense of a society.” (Fiske 6)

codes: camera work, lighting, editing, music, casting, setting and costume, make-up, action, dialogue, ideological codes, etc.

SOME TERMINOLOGY

“Programs are stable, fixed entities, produced and sold as commodities, and organized by schedulers into distribution packages. . . . A text is a different matter altogether.  Programs are produced, distributed, and defined by the industry: texts are the product of their readers.  So a program becomes a text at the moment of reading” (Fiske 14)

“A text is the site of struggles for meaning that reproduce the conflicts of interest between the producers and consumers of the cultural commodity.” (Fiske 14)

“Discourse is a language or system of representation that has developed socially in order to make and circulate a coherent set of meanings about an important topic area. . . . Discourse is thus a social act which may promote or oppose the dominant ideology, and is thus often referred to as a ‘discursive practice’.” (Fiske 14)

“A textual study of television, then, involves three foci:  the formal qualities of television programs and their flow; the intertextual relations of television within itself, with other media, and with conversation; and the study of socially situated readers and the process of reading.” (Fiske 16)

“audience” = mass, singular, passive, cultural dopes; “audiences” = at least plural, involves dimension of power; “viewer” or “reader” = more active, makers of meaning

Bourdieu and cultural capital:  “This theory of cultural capital explains the social function of culture as the provision of a system of meanings and pleasures that underwrites the social system structured around economic, class, and other forms of social power.” (Fiske 18)

“Popular cultural capital consists of the meanings of social subordination and of the strategies (such as those of accommodation, resistance, opposition, or evasion) by which people respond to it. . . . meanings made by a value system that opposes or evades the dominant ideology” (Fiske 18-19)

“Pleasure results from the production of meanings of the world and of self that are felt to serve the interests of the reader rather than those of the dominant.” (Fiske 19)

“Television does not ‘cause’ identifiable effects in individuals; it does, however, work ideologically to promote and prefer certain meanings of the world, to circulate some meanings rather than others, and to serve some social interests better than others.” (Fiske 20)


CHAPTER 2: REALISM

realism: “reproduces the dominant sense of reality” (Fiske 21)

TV metaphorized as window/mirror

“Realism developed alongside empiricism, individualism, humanism, and the bourgeoisie, so it is not surprising that it should share characteristics with all of them.” (Fiske 21-22)

“Film presents itself as a record of what has happened, television presents itself as a relay of what is happening.” (Fiske 22)

THE FORM OF REALISM

“The way we make sense of a realistic text is through the same broad ideological frame as the way we make sense of our social experience in the industrialized west” (Fiske 24)

“the text produces a socially located position that it invites the viewer to occupy in order to understand it easily and unproblematically” (Fiske 25)

“by adopting this comfortable and ideologically rewarded position we are not just making easy sense of the text, we are reproducing the dominant ideology in our reading practice and are thus maintaining and validating it” (Fiske 25)

REALISM AND RADICALISM

theory of realism leading us to the conclusion that “realism is inevitably reactionary, it finally represents the world to us in a way that naturalizes the status quo” (Fiske 33)

relationship between realism and radicalism; radicalism = “a critical interrogation of the dominant ideology and of the social system which it has produced and underpins” (Fiske 33)

“Realism involves a fidelity both to the physical, sensually perceived details of the external world, and to the values of the dominant ideology.” (Fiske 36)


CHAPTER 3: REALISM AND IDEOLOGY

POPULARITY

economics of television demand mass audience; mass audience is inevitably heterogeneous; television attempts to homogenize: “This common ground is to be found firstly in a shared dominant ideology and secondly in a set of textual conventions that producers and readers share because they are part of a common history and experience.” (Fiske 37)

does conventionality of form defuse any radicalism or social questioning? see Frankfurt School and the “culture industry” — all oppositional movements are immediately incorporated; see also Barthes’s inoculation metaphor

leaves no room for resistance; “Gramsci’s theory of hegemony grants resistance a far more important role than does Althusser’s theory of ideology.  Briefly, hegemony may be defined as that process whereby the subordinate are led to consent to the system that subordinates them.  This is achieved when they ‘consent’ to view the social system and its everyday embodiments as ‘common sense,’ the self-evidently natural.” (Fiske 40) — hegemony as constant struggle with no final victory

REALISM AND DISCOURSE

realism as a discourse that hides its discursive nature and presents itself as natural rather than cultural

“So, as critics, we must never be content with asking and revealing what view of the world is being presented, but must recognize that someone’s view of the world is implicitly or explicitly, obviously or subtly, inscribed within it.  Revealing the who within the what is possibly the most important task of criticism.” (Fiske 42)

discursive power v. economic power; “exnomination” as the process by which the bourgeoisie disguises its discursive power, un-naming itself

TELEVISION AND SOCIAL CHANGE

“The problem with much traditional textual analysis, whether its impulse has been ideological or aesthetic, is that it has tended to produce an authoritarian, even ‘correct,’ reading of a text, and has tended to ascribe to the text the power to impose this reading on the viewer.” (Fiske 45)

the progressive text, “where the discourses of social change are articulated in relationship with the meta-discourse of the dominant ideology” (Fiske 47)


CHAPTER 4: SUBJECTIVITY AND ADDRESS

“Theories deriving from both structuralism and Marxism require us to replace the notion of the individual with that of the subject.  This is not to deny that we are all individuals, that is, that we inhabit different bodies with different and unique genetic structures, but it is to say that that part of us which forms our individuality is essentially biological, part of nature, and does not, therefore, form a major part of the study of culture.  What cultural studies are concerned with, of course, is the sense that various cultures make of ‘the individual,’ and the sense of self that we, as individuals, experience.  This constructed sense of the individual in a network of social relations is what is referred to as ‘the subject’.” (Fiske 48)

subjectivity as the product of social relations working in three ways, “through society, through language or discourse, and through the psychic processes through which the infant enters into society, language, and consciousness.” (Fiske 49)

THE SOCIAL SUBJECT

“Television is able to construct a social position for us only because these social agencies have been working all our lives to construct our subjectivities in equivalent ways.” (Fiske 51)

THE DISCURSIVE SUBJECT

Althusser and “interpellation” or the mode of address

ADDRESSING THE SUBJECT

PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE SUBJECT


CHAPTER 5: ACTIVE AUDIENCES

TEXT AND SOCIAL SUBJECTS

“The object of ethnographic study is the way that people live their culture.  Its value for us lies in its shift of emphasis away from the textual and ideological construction of the subject to socially and historically situated people.” (Fiske 63)

“This revaluation of the viewer requires a similar revaluation of the text.  Textual studies of television now have to stop treating it as a closed text, that is, as one where the dominant ideology exerts considerable, if not total, influence over its ideological structure and therefore over its reader.” (Fiske 63-64)

Stuart Hall: dominant, oppositional, and negotiated readings; Umberto Eco: aberrant decoding

MAKING MEANINGS

MODES OF RECEPTION

“Screen theory’s emphasis on the power of the text over the reader is more justifiable for cinema than for television, and the cinema audience may well be relatively more powerless than the television audience. . . . In going out to cinema we tend to submit to its terms, to become subject to its discourse, but television comes to us, enters our cultural space, and becomes subject to our discourses.” (Fiske 74)

GOSSIP AND ORAL CULTURE

THE SOCIAL DETERMINATIONS OF MEANINGS


CHAPTER 6: ACTIVATED TEXTS

“the television text is a potential of meanings capable of being viewed with a variety of modes of attention and by a variety of viewers.  To be popular, television must be both polysemic and flexible.” (Fiske 84) — TV text as state of tension between forces of closure and forces of openness

THE POLYSEMY OF THE TELEVISION TEXT

irony (a statement that appears to say one thing while actually saying another); metaphor; jokes; contradiction (heteroglossia); excess (excess as hyperbole, semiotic excess)

“But this polysemy is not anarchic and unstructured: the meanings withing the text are structured by the differential distribution of textual power in the same way that social groups are related according to the differential distribution of social power.  All meanings are not equal, nor equally easily activated, but all exist in relations of subordination or opposition to the dominant meanings proposed by the text.” (Fiske 93)

OPEN, WRITERLY TEXTS

“The writerly text, which the television text often is and always can be, requires us, its readers, to participate in the production of meaning and thus of our own subjectivities, it requires us to speak rather than be spoken and to subordinate the moment of production to the moment of reception.” (Fiske 95)

PRODUCERLY TEXTS

“A producerly text combines the televisual characteristics of a writerly text with the easy accessibility of the readerly.” (Fiske 95)

SEGMENTATION AND FLOW

“The television text, then, is composed of a rapid succession of compressed, vivid segments where the principle of logic and cause and effect is subordinated to that of association and consequence to sequence.” (Fiske 105)

TELEVISION AND ORAL CULTURE

television as “secondary orality”; television serves folkloric functions for audience


CHAPTER 7: INTERTEXTUALITY

“The theory of intertextuality proposes that any one text is necessarily read in relationship to others and that a range of textual knowledges is brought to bear upon it. . . . Intertextuality exists rather in the space between texts.” (Fiske 108)

“Intertextual knowledges pre-orient the reader to exploit television’s polysemy by activating the text in certain ways, that is, by making some meanings rather than others.” (Fiske 108)

HORIZONTAL INTERTEXTUALITY

GENRE

“Understanding works of art generically, however, locates their value in what they have in common, for their shared conventions form links not only with other texts in the genre, but also between text and audiences, text and producers, and producers and audiences.” (Fiske 110)

“A genre seen textually should be defined as a shifting provisional set of characteristics which is modified as each new example is produced.” (Fiske 111)

INESCAPABLE INTERTEXTUALITY

“Postmodernism posits the rejection of meaning in its affirmation of the image as signifier with no final signified; images exist in an infinite chain of intertextuality.” (Fiske 116)

VERTICAL INTERTEXTUALITY: READING THE SECONDARY TEXT

relations of a primary text to secondary texts specifically about it

THE TERTIARY TEXT

“the texts that the viewers make themselves out of their responses, which circulate orally or in letters to the press, and which work to form a collective rather than an individual response” (Fiske 124)

INTERTEXTUALITY AND POLYSEMY


CHAPTER 8: NARRATIVE

narrative and language as two main shared cultural processes

two dimensions of narrative: syntagmatic/paradigmatic

“labels such as ‘realistic’ or ‘mythic’ are not just descriptors of textual characteristics but are active: they promote particular reading strategies which activate particular meanings in the text.” (Fiske 130)

REALISM REVISITED

“Verisimilitude is based not on iconic representation, but upon replicating the conventions by which sense is made.  It is thus an ideological practice. . . . Realism imposes coherence and resolution upon a world that has neither.” (Fiske 130)

STRUCTURALIST APPROACHES TO NARRATIVE

MYTHIC NARRATIVE

myth as anxiety-reducing mechanism (Levi-Strauss); binary oppositions; deep structure

myths as working to naturalize history; myth in capitalist society as bourgeois (Barthes)

NARRATIVE STRUCTURES

a universal structure of popular narrative? disruption/restoration

“in popular culture the narrative structure is likely to be used in favor of the status quo” (Fiske 140)

“The conservative drive of the narrative structure may be undeniable, but its effectivity is far more open to doubt.” (Fiske 140)

NARRATIVE CODES

five codes (Barthes):  symbolic (binary oppositions), semic, referential, action, hermeneutic

“A code is a bridge between texts, and meaning is encoded via intertextuality” (Fiske 144)

TELEVISUAL NARRATIVE

serial v. series; “Television viewing is more interactive than either cinema spectating or novel reading and consequently its narratives are more open to negotiation.  The segmented, fractured nature of television, its producerly texts, and its active audiences, come together to oppose any forces of closure within its narrative structures.” (Fiske 147)


CHAPTER 9: CHARACTER READING

“Television is centrally concerned with the representation of people — its most typical image is a mid-shot or close-up of someone talking or reacting.” (Fiske 149)

“Character representation on television differs significantly from the cinema or theater, and this difference arises from two prime televisual characteristics: its series or serial form, and its ‘nowness’ or ‘liveness’.” (Fiske 149)

“TV deals not with stars but with personalities . . . Classic Hollywood stars were bigger than their roles, and were remembered or promoted by their own names not those of their characters.  Television personalities merge into their characters or are submerged by them.” (Fiske 150)

REALIST AND STRUCTURAL APPROACHES

character as “real,” individual, v. character as textual device, construct of discourse; “Discursive readings emphasize the social, realistic readings the individual” (Fiske 154)

READING CHARACTER FROM THE PRIMARY TEXT

“The discursive theory of understanding character is polysemic, because texts are.” (Fiske 160); character as an embodied ideology

READING CHARACTER: THE SECONDARY TEXTS

IDENTIFICATION, IMPLICATION, AND IDEOLOGY

PSYCHOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION

IMPLICATION

IDEOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION


CHAPTER 10: GENDERED TELEVISION: FEMININITY

SOAP OPERA FORM

concentrating on soap opera’s serial form and the multiplicity of its plots

DISRUPTION

DEFERMENT AND PROCESS

SEXUALITY AND EMPOWERMENT

EXCESS

PLENITUDE AND POLYSEMY

THE FEMININE AS DECENTERED

“the cultural formations of patriarchy constantly reproduce and revalidate these differences [between men and women], and soap operas work more explicitly than most art forms to connect with women’s decentered subjectivity, their social relations in patriarchy, and the structure of texts that are popular with them.” (Fiske 196)


CHAPTER 11: GENDERED TELEVISION: MASCULINITY

THE STRUCTURE OF THE MASCULINE A-TEAM

THE ABSENCE OF WOMEN

THE ABSENCE OF WORK AND MARRIAGE

THE A-TEAM AS ACHIEVEMENT

THE PHALLUS, THE PENIS, AND PORN

MALE BONDING AND THE HERO TEAM

GENDER AND NARRATIVE FORM

“The difference between centered and decentered reading subjects is partly explained by their different relations to the dominant ideology.  Ideology works to produce a centered subject, and a centered subject is thus more likely to live through the practice of the dominant ideology.  Conversely, a decentered subject is potentially resistive in that it provides for alternative or oppositional meanings.” (Fiske 218)


CHAPTER 12: PLEASURE AND PLAY

many meanings of “pleasure”: psychoanalytic use relates it to desire; Barthes’s “plaisir” refers to a pleasure which is essentially cultural (“jouissance” is more bodily pleasure); social use — all depend, to some extent, on “the relationship between pleasure and power” (Fiske 224)

PSYCHOANALYSIS AND PLEASURE

cinema spectatorship as voyeurism (Lara Mulvey); the male gaze; the fetishization of the female

“Pleasure is thus reactionary, for both the dominant ideology and Freudian explanations of sexuality work to naturalize the patriarchal status quo.” (Fiske 226)

TV more interactive than voyeuristic

PLEASURE AND SOCIAL CONTROL

“Pleasure is, in western societies, typically classed as an indulgence, the expression of selfishness, idleness, vanity and thus productive of guilt.” Fiske (227)

“For Barthes, pleasure is opposed to ideological control, though plaisir less so than jouissance.” (Fiske 228); plaisir as plural, jouissance singular; jouissance occurs at the moment of the breakdown of culture; reading with the body

“Pleasure is decentralized and is part of the reading that creates a text out of a work; central to it, then, is the sense that the reader has some control over the production of meaning.” (Fiske 230)

PLEASURE, PLAY, AND CONTROL

play: text has “play” in it; reader “plays” it like an instrument; “plays” it like a game

PLEASURE AND RULE BREAKING

“Rules are one of the hegemonic forces through which the dominant try to win the consent of the subordinate to the control of their ‘unruliness.’ The pleasures of breaking rules or exposing their arbitrariness are resistive pleasures of the subordinate.” (Fiske 235)

EMPOWERING PLAY

“In so far as play is a representation of certain aspects of the social world, the power of play involves the power to play with the boundary between the representation and the real, to insert oneself into the process of representation so that one is not subjected by it, but, conversely, is empowered by it.” (Fiske 236)

PLEASURE AND TEXTUALITY


CHAPTER 13: CARNIVAL AND STYLE

ways in which the popular pleasures of television can “evade, resist, or scandalize ideology and social control” (Fiske 240)

Bakhtin’s theory of the carnival; “Like play, carnival abides by certain rules that give it a pattern, but unlike play (whose rules tend to replicate the social), carnival inverts those rules and builds a world upside down, one structured according to the logic of the ‘inside out’ that provides ‘a parody of the extracarnival life’.” (Fiske 242)

ROCK ’N’ WRESTLING

three main forms of folk carnival (Bakhtin): ritual spectacles; comic compositions; Billingsgate

the grotesque (as opposed to the aesthetics of the beautiful)

“In the postmodern world, style performs many of the functions of carnival.” (Fiske 249)

“Ideology insists on an overall controlling pattern of sense: fragmenting sense into the senses reproduces the liberation of carnival.” (Fiske 250)

STYLE AND MUSIC VIDEO

“Style is a recycling of images that wrenches them out of the original context that enabled them to make sense and reduces them to free-floating signifiers whose only signification is that they are free, outside the control of normal sense and sense-making” (Fiske 250)

music video as first postmodern television?  “Postmodernism emphasizes the fragmentary nature of images, their resistance to sense, the way that images are more imperative than the real and have displaced it in our experience.” (Fiske 254)

THE PLEASURES OF MIAMI VICE

“The meanings of commodities are moved out of their original economic domain into the more pleasurable one of style.” (Fiske 259)

spectacle: public construction of the self via style

“Images are neither the bearers of ideology, not the representations of the real, but what Baudrillard calls ‘the hyperreal’: the television image, the advertisement, the pop song become more ‘real’ than ‘reality,’ their sensuous imperative is so strong that they are our experience” (Fiske 260)

COMMODIFIED PLEASURE


CHAPTER 14: QUIZZICAL PLEASURES

GAME AND RITUAL

Levi-Strauss: game = participants start equal and finish differentiated (winners and losers); ritual = participants start differentiated and move toward equality

ritual-game-ritual structure of quiz shows as enactment of capitalist ideology

mirroring of educational system?

KNOWLEDGE AND POWER

LUCK

COMMODITIES

THE ACTIVE AUDIENCE

ARTICULATING QUIZ SHOWS

Stuart Hall’s idea of articulation: both “speaking” (the text) and “a flexible link” (intertextuality)


CHAPTER 15: NEWS READINGS, NEWS READERS

“In this chapter I study news as discourse, that is, as a set of conventions that strive to control and limit the meanings of the events that it conveys.” (Fiske 282)

“textually, there is not a lot of difference between television news and television series or serial drama” (Fiske 282)

“events seem to be part of nature, whereas the telling of stories and the selection of the key events are clearly cultural activities” (Fiske 283)

THE STRATEGIES OF CONTAINMENT

paradigmatic (categorization)/syntagmatic (narrativization)

CATEGORIZATION

What is news?  Event should have occurred w/in last 24 hours; event should concern elite persons; occurs in public sphere; is negative

SUBCATEGORIES

“Categorization constructs a conceptual grid within which ‘raw’ events can be instantly located and thus inserted into a familiar set of conceptual relationships.  Categories are normalizing agents.” (Fiske 287)

OBJECTIVITY

“Clawback then is the process by which potentially disruptive events are mediated into the dominant value system without losing their authenticity.  This authenticity guarantees the ‘truth’ of the interpretation that this mediating involves and thus allows, paradoxically, that which has been interpreted to present itself as objective.  Objectivity is the ‘unauthored’ voice of the bourgeoisie.” (Fiske 289)

EXNOMINATION AND INOCULATION

“Exnomination is the evacuation of a concept from the linguistic system with its structure of difference and alternatives.  That which is exnominated appears to have no alternative and is thus granted the status of the natural” (Fiske 290)

“Nominating discourses places them low in the hierarchy and thus licenses them to speak oppositionally or radically.  The exnominated metadiscourse, however, speaks the final ‘truth’” (Fiske 290)

inoculation: allowing radical voices a controlled moment of speech which strengthens the dominant discourse

METAPHOR

“Unlike literature, news stories use metaphors that are so conventional that they have become cliches and their metaphorical nature is consequently unrecognized.” (Fiske 291)

NEWS NARRATIVE

constant form of news stories, filled by varying content; crucial strategy of containment

narrative structure of (implied) order, disruption, restoration

NEWS ANALYSIS

THE FORCES OF DISRUPTION


CHAPTER 16: CONCLUSION: THE POPULAR ECONOMY

THE PROBLEM OF THE POPULAR

“In the cultural domain, then, popular art is an ephemeral, multifarious concept based upon multiple and developing relationships with the practices of the dominant ideology.” (Fiske 310)

THE TWO ECONOMIES

financial/cultural; financial: sale of program to distributor, sale of audience to sponsor; cultural: production of  meanings and pleasures by audience-producers

blur between producers/consumers in cultural economy

POPULAR CULTURAL CAPITAL

RESISTANCE AND SEMIOTIC POWER

“The argument that this [semiotic power] is a pseudo-power that dissipates the drive to seize ‘real’ political or economic power underestimates the extent to which the construction of subjectivity is political.” (Fiske 318)

DIVERSITY AND DIFFERENCE

diversity of programming v. diversity of readings (which is often greater when programming is most bland and homogenous)

“In a mass society the materials and meaning systems out of which cultures are made will almost inevitably be produced by the cultural industries: but the making of these materials into culture, that is, into the meanings of self and of social relations, and the exchange of these materials for pleasure is a process that can only be performed by their consumer-users, not by their producers.” (Fiske 323)

relationship between entertainment and politics: “Resistive reading practices that assert the power of the subordinate in the process of representation and its subsequent pleasure pose a direct challenge to the power of capitalism to produce its subjects-in-ideology.” (Fiske 326)
