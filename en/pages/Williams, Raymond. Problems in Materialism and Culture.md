A HUNDRED YEARS OF CULTURE AND ANARCHY

Matthew Arnold’s Culture and Anarchy, late 1860s; spirit frequently evoked in late 1960s

Arnold’s emphasis on culture in direct response to what he saw as a crisis of anarchy — crisis was actually idea of extending right to vote to working classes

fight for right to public demonstrations in Hyde Park

Carlyle as extreme reactionary: reimposition of order by aristocracy

J.S. Mill as leader of liberal/radical contingent

Arnold begins series of lectures which become Culture and Anarchy — stands apart from orthodoxy; criticizes national obsession with wealth and production; criticizes manipulation of opinion by politicians and newspapers; criticizes the abstraction of “freedom”; talks of need for men of culture to disseminate this culture (“the best knowledge and thought of the time”)

Arnold sees Hyde Park rioter as symptom of general anarchy; believes anarchy must be suppressed (order must be maintained) in order for members of society to work toward their “best selves” — even demonstrations for elimination of slave trade must be forcibly repressed (later excised from 2nd ed)

“it is still very remarkable that the humane argument of the initial position should approach, let alone reach, this degree of anger and desire for repression” (Williams 7)

1960s New Right sounds much like Arnold, talking of excellence and humane values but pushing for repression — “Arnold is a source for this group, though it is significant that many of them have dropped much of his actual social criticism and especially his untiring advocacy of extended popular education” (Williams 7)

modern-day Arnolds as “a culmination of the wrong kind of liberalism” (Williams 8)

“It also matters whether, in the inevitable tensions of new kinds of argument and new kinds of claim, the defenders of reason and education become open to new and unfamiliar relationships, or instead relapse to their existing habits and privileges and then — as is now happening, but as significantly didn’t happen in Arnold — manoeuvre and combine to restrict, to purge, to impoverish education itself.” (Williams 8)


LITERATURE AND SOCIOLOGY (FOR LUCIEN GOLDMAN)

introduction of theory to British study of literature

problems of theory: need for theory/obstacles to getting it; fears of turning study of literature into positivist “science”

the limits of ‘practical criticism’: beginnings of English literary sociology; battle between Scrutiny (Leavis) and English Marxists; weakness of Marxism in reductionism

the social totality: objections to base/superstructure formula; reification — historical explanation for dominance of economic over other forms of human activity

structures of feeling: developed out of structuralism: mental structures which organize consciousness


BASE AND SUPERSTRUCTURE IN MARXIST CRITICAL THEORY

“determining base . . . determined superstructure” (Williams 31)

spatialized and “at times unacceptable” version of Marxist proposition that social being determines consciousness

idea of “determination” — inherited from idealism/theology

in Marxism, determination used in sense of prefiguration, prediction, or control by an outside force

superstructure: qualifications and amendments: ‘area’ where all cultural and ideological activities are places; simplest notion of superstructure was as direct reflection of base; 1st stage of qualification: notion of delays in time; 2nd stage: notion of “mediation”; must look at idea of “base” — has come to be looked at as object

the base and the productive forces: base as process, not state; must revalue all terms: “We have to revalue ‘determination’ towards the setting of limits and the exertion of pressure, and away from a predicted, prefigured, and controlled content.  We have to revalue ‘superstructure’ towards a related range of cultural practices, and away from a reflected, reproduced or specifically dependent content.  And, crucially, we have to revalue ‘the base’ away from the notion of a fixed economic or technological abstraction, and towards the specific activities of men in real social and economic relationships, containing fundamental contradictions and variations and therefore always in a state of dynamic process.” (Williams 34)

uses of totality: Lukács: totality of social practices — opposed to notion of base and superstructure — based on notion that social being determines consciousness; however: easy to empty of Marxist content; “Indeed, the key question to ask about any notion of totality in cultural theory is this: whether the notion of totality includes the notion of intention.” (Williams 36)

the complexity of hegemony: Gramscian concept of hegemony — “supposes the existence of something which is truly total, which is not merely secondary or superstructural, like the weak sense of ideology, but which is lived at such a depth, which saturates the society to such an extent, and which, as Gramsci put it, even constitutes the substance and limit of common sense for most people under its sway” (Williams 37); hegemony as plural, complex; real social process on which dominant culture depends: incorporation (education, family, etc.); existence of the possibility of opposition

residual and emergent cultures: both are alternative and oppositional; “residual” = experiences, meanings and values which are residue of some previous social formation; “emergent” = new experiences, meanings, values; attempts always made very early to incorporate the emergent into the dominant culture; distinction between “alternative” and “oppositional” — difference between  “someone who simply finds a different way to live and wishes to be left alone with it, and someone who finds a different way to live and wants to change the society in its light” (Williams 42); need non-metaphysical, non-subjectivist explanation of emergent culture

class and human practice: from Marxist theory, idea of formation of new class; “no mode of production, and therefore no dominant society or order of society, and therefore no dominant culture, in reality exhausts the full range of human practice, human energy, human intention” (Williams 43) — will always be some practices dominant culture cannot recognize; “In capitalist practice, if the thing is not making a profit, or if it is not being widely circulated, then it can for some time be overlooked, at least while it remains alternative.  When it becomes oppositional in an explicit way, it does, of course, get approached or attacked.” (Williams 43); rising class can have different interests from dominant culture; relationship between literature and society — none; literature is a practice of society and cannot be separated; takes place in all areas of culture (dominant, residual, emergent)

critical theory as consumption: nearly all forms of critical theory as theories of consumption; early notions of “taste” and “sensibility”; later, New Criticism — isolated text as object; practices of production overlooked; formula of base and superstructure used; texts studies as “object” and “components”

objects and practices: crisis in cultural theory: between view of art as object and art as practice; many arts are not objects but notations: drama, music, performing arts; relationship between making of art and its reception as active, subject to conventions; very different from production and consumption of an object; “What this can show us here about the practice of analysis is that we have to break from the common procedure of isolating the object and then discovering its components. On the contrary we have to discover the nature of a practice and then its conditions.” (Williams 47)


MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AS MEANS OF PRODUCTION

 means of communication both as forms of production and means of production; subject to historical development

three ideological blocks: (1) means of communication are “seen only as ‘media’: devices for the passing of ‘information’” (Williams 51) with people seen as abstract categories of senders and receivers — deeply bourgeois position; (2) in attempt to recognize some means of communication as means of production, distinction between “natural” and “technological” means of communication — but separation of everyday language from “mass communications” obscures fact that mass comm uses everyday language; also obscures differences between different forms of mass comm; (2 var) McLuhanite: recognizes specific differences between media but then “succumbs to a localized technological determinism, in which uses and relationships are technically determined by the properties of different media, irrespective of the whole complex of social productive forces and relationships within which they are developed and used” (Williams 52); (3) abstract and a priori separation of means of communication from means of production — parallels simplistic separation of base/superstructure

towards a history of ‘communicative production’: need new approaches to history of means of communications; most kinds of histories have been “specialized technical studies of what are seen as new ‘media’” (Williams 53-54) — but isolated from history of development of general productive forces

distinguishing between different modes of communications:  those which depend on human resources/those which depend on non-human material

types of use or transformation of non-human material (amplificatory/durative/alternative)

amplificatory = radio; durative = sound recording; alternative = writing

amplificatory and durative based on skills of primary social communication

alternative communicative modes require development of specialized skills

changes in technology affect class relations within the processes (e.g. division in newspaper between those with things to say [journalists, editors] and those who merely reproduce the words of others [typesetters, printers])

‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ communication: radio and TV can be direct, but can also be edited, as in film — editing as signifying process

“It is in this sense that radio and television, in all forms other than the simplest direct transmission, and then video and film, have to be seen finally as alternative modes, rather than as simply amplificatory or durative.” (Williams 60)

must carefully analyze transforming processes of TV and film, as well as their modes of “naturalization,” as they are so powerful that real relations and activities of men are hidden behind a reified form; socialist “recovery” of these means of communications/production


IDEAS OF NATURE

idea of nature contains much human history; complicated and changing ideas, though it appears otherwise

nature as singular, abstracted, personified: manipulable idea of a singular and essential nature; “What is often being argued, it seems to me, in the idea of nature is the idea of man” (Williams 70-71)

new idea of ev olution: what is covered by “nature”? is man included? or should one learn to surpass it?

man as abstraction: “to speak of man ‘intervening’ in natural processes is to suppose that he might find it possible not to do so” (Williams 75); separation of man from nature — alienation of nature

the natural and the conventional: great part of “natural landscape” created by human labor; 18th c. idea of nature as “order and right reason”

arguments for and against “improvement” — interference in “natural” processes; exploitation of nature, “altering nature to a consumable form” (Williams 81); a Darwinian ruthlessness in nature

separation/alienation of nature and human activity — function of increasing real interaction? we have mixed our labor with the earth too thoroughly to separate it out; unequal levels of interaction; “conquest” and “domination” of nature will invariably involve the conquest and domination of men


SOCIAL DARWINISM

errors of emphasis in extending theory of natural selection to social and political theory

Herbert Spencer: coined term “survival of the fittest”; believed that social selection was operative in human history (and that men and governments should not interfere with it)

prefigured by Hobbes: life as war of all against all

development of ideas from Spencer, becoming more sinister: Sumner — survival of the fittest = civilization, survival of the unfittest = anti-civilization

ideology of social Darwinism “consciously in opposition to liberal egalitarian tendencies, to measures of social welfare and reform, and classically to ideas of socialism” (Williams 90-91)

two particular applications of principle: theory of eugenics; theory of class struggle

belief that society was controlled by evolutionary movement led to conviction that society could not be changed by intervention, much less revolution

Veblen: yes, some are selected, but does our system select the right traits?; other writers led to theories of Fascism, cooperation

reflection of theories of Social Darwinism in literature

“man cannot derive lessons and laws from the processes of what he sees as a separated nature” (Williams 101)


PROBLEMS OF MATERIALISM

intellectual difficulties in definition of categories in terms of physical investigations:  (1) categories constantly subject to radical revision; (2) in opposing systematization, many of these categories begin to appear systematized; tendency of materialism to get stuck in its own recent generalizations

political and cultural considerations: connection of materialism to social and political struggle (and thus potential for attachment of frozen ideas to political movements); also, absolute equation of socialism with materialism

Timpanaro provoking question of materialism; polemic against Frankfurt School and Althusser, attacking on question of materialism, seeing their tendencies as divergent; relations between his understanding of materialism and his use of concept of nature

man and nature:  defines materialism as “priority of nature over ‘mind,’ or if you like, of the physical level over the biological level, and of the biological level over the socio-economic and cultural level” (Williams 106); separation of nature and man

the ‘conquest of nature’: can only be described if ‘man’ and ‘nature’ are taken to be separate; Marxism compromised by triumphalist idea of conquest of nature which is at heart of imperialist/capitalist ideology; Engels’s sense of man as within nature, not as ruler of it

biology and liberation: “What matters here — and it is a very significant amendment of orthodox Marxist thinking about art — is that art-work is itself, before everything, a material process; and that, although differentially, the material process of the production of art includes certain biological processes” (Williams 113)

social projects and the individual: should fact of inevitability of individual death affect participation in social projects?

psychoanalysis and materialism: materialist critique

language and science: study of linguistics; polemic against structuralism (“categorical argument against abusers of categories” [Williams 119])

the materialist project


SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT AND THEATRICAL ENVIRONMENT: THE CASE OF ENGLISH NATURALISM

three relevant sense of “naturalism”:  “accurate” or “lifelike” representation; philosophical position allied to science, natural history, and materialism; fusing of accurate production and phil. position

third sense: conscious linkage of literary and scientific methods and laws of natural history

character and action as determined by environment; sense of historical production

naturalism as culmination of bourgeois theory and practice; only ceases to be bourgeois “when, as in Marxist theory, action is seen not only within an environment but as itself, within certainly limits and pressures, producing an environment” (Williams 127)

why did naturalism not develop in the English theatre?

physical reproduction in the theatre: development of picture-frame stage as reproduction of ‘real’ environment; “This reminds us that in the theatre as in any other area of cultural technology, the doctrine of technological determinism — the creation of a form seen as determined by technical development; naturalism as the consequence of improvements in stage-carpentry — is false” (Williams 130)

changing social relations in drama and theatre: three periods — before 1830: completion of process of movement to popular audience, entry of the bourgeoisie; 1830-1860: diverging theatre interests appealing to divergent audiences; 1860-1914: appearance of dividing lines between “respectable” and “popular” audiences

melodrama: studying developing dramatic forms in relation to social changes; connections between the replacement of sentimental comedy by melodrama and replacement of “polite” audience with “popular” audience; certain radicalism in British popular culture between 1820 and 1850 (compare with new style of Sunday newspaper); fundamental paradox: “the elements of the social and moral consciousness which was to inform serious naturalism went mainly, in England, into the melodrama, which at the same time preserved, as the foundation of its conventions, providential notions of the righting of wrongs, the exposure of villainy, and the triumph or apotheosis of innocence” (Williams 137)

domestic naturalism: naturalism in most technical sense, the “lifelike” stage; set beside “high” naturalism, naturalism in English theatre clearly of a smaller dimension

naturalism and the problem play: social character of West End theatre; integrated middle-class audience, but dominant tones were those of “society”; interaction of “society drama” and “problem play”

special conditions for limitations and lateness of naturalism in the English theatre

remaining to be questioned: relations between naturalist method and naturalist structures of feeling


THE BLOOMSBURY FRACTION

problems of method in study of cultural groups; “The real point is to see the significance of the cultural group over and above the simple empirical presentation and self-definition as ‘a group of friends’.” (Williams 151)

the formation of Bloomsbury: shared values and habits of friends; development of style; social conscience (sympathy for, but not solidarity with, lower classes); Bloomsbury as “fraction” of existing English upper class: “They were at once against its dominant ideas and values and still willingly, in all immediate ways, part of it.” (Williams 156)

Godwin and his circle: earlier group (1780s and 90s), religious dissenters, emerging small-bourgeois intelligentsia, arguing for equality; not a fraction breaking off from upper class, but emergent sector of a relatively subordinate class — cannot simply define groups internally, but must look at relation to social system as a whole

the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood: mid-19th c.; opposed to conventional philistinism of the day; return to old as means to new; break from their class (commercial bourgeoisie) but also means toward next stage of development of the class

the Bloomsbury fraction: development and reform of cultural life in nineteenth-century bourgeois England helped build new, highly educated sector of upper class; connections of Bloomsbury group to upper levels of colonial administration; four factors: (1) “the provenance of the group in the professional and highly educated sector of the English upper class”; (2) “the element of contradiction between some of these highly educated people and the ideas and institutions of their class as a whole”; (3) “the specific contradiction between the presence of highly intelligent and intellectual women, within these families, and their relative exclusion from the dominant and formative male institutions”; (4) “the internal needs and tensions of this class as a whole, and especially of its professional and highly educated sector, in a period which, for all its apparent stability, was one of social, political, cultural, and intellectual crisis.” (Williams 162) — Bloomsbury separated out as a fraction based on second and third factors; first defines particular quality of fraction; fourth defines historical significance

the contribution of Bloomsbury: “there is something in the way in which Bloomsbury denied its existence as a formal group, while continuing to insist on its group qualities, which is the clue to the essential definition” (Williams 164) — centrality of free expression of “civilized individual” — central definition of bourgeois ideology; integration of specific ideas of members of group not necessary, since all already integrated at level of “civilized individual”

Bloomsbury, in holding a private sensibility which was protected and extended by forms of public concern, fashioned “the contemporary ideological dissociation between ‘public’ and ‘private’ life” (Williams 168)


ADVERTISING: THE MAGIC SYSTEM

1. history of advertisitn: not just easy summary of early processes of giving notice of something; concerned with “the development from processes of specific attention and information to an institutionalized system of commercial information and persuasion” (Williams 170); first signs of organized system come with development of newspapers, mercuries, etc.; most were simple (now “classified”) ads, but some with “recommendations”; most extravagant in field of patent medicines (ordinary household goods rarely advertised — people knew where to get those); ads called attention to themselves via extravagant promises; entrance of the mountebank and the huckster give “advertising” a more specific meaning

2. development: Industrial Revolution changed nature of advertising, but not in simple fashion; immense growth attributable to abolition of Advertisement Tax (1853) and Stamp Duty (1855); but ads still mostly classified, and advertising still felt to be not respectable; tone of advertisements still quite eighteenth-century; style: hack verse, “commercial purple” (Williams 174); rise also in flybill posting and distribution of handbills; but with all increase, basic relation between advertising and production had only partly changed; newspapers still resisting any arrangement of ads other than simple classified; in 1880s, newspapers began to adapt to techniques of the poster — illlustrations, etc.; in first years of 20th c., colored electric sign; legislation to restrict advertising followed; running fight between traditional standards (“taste”) and the inventiveness of advertisers (“the needs of commerce”) continues now

3. transformation: deep changes in the economy; formation of modern advertising must be traced to characteristics of monopoly capitalism; development 1880s-1930s; growing desire to control the market led to increased role for advertising; changes in organization of advertising: growth of importance of the agencies, no longer working for the press, but now working for industry; advertising is recognized as means of financing newspapers; first emphasis of advertising as a profession; first conscious attention to psychology of advertising around time of WWI — pressures of economy and needs of war were immense; “The need to control nominally free men, like the need to control nominally free customers, lay very deep in the new kind of society” (Williams 180); post-war, development of comsumer credit; mood of critical scepticism in public, replied to in ads, in knowing, sophisticated tone; code of standards developed in 1950 banning ads for patent medicines; “Advertising had come to power, at the centre of the economy, and it had to get rid of the disreputable friends of its youth” (Williams 181)

4. advertising in power: new economy, new kinds of appeal, new media: radio, television; spectacular expansion since 1950s; public relations: the extension of organized publicity, designed to sell persons; difficulty of drawing line between “real” and “staged” news, which is often paid; “The extension is natural, in a society where selling, by any effective means, has become a primary ethic. The spectacular groth of advertising, and then its extension to apparently independent reporting, has behind it not a mere pressure-group, as in the days of the quacks, but the whole impetus of a society.” (Williams 184)

5. the system: advertising as source of finance for whole range of communication; advertising as “the official art of modern capitalist society” (Williams 184); complaints that our society is too materialist, but perhaps it is not materialist enough: “we have a cultural pattern in which the objects are not enough but must be validated, if only in fantasy, by association with social and personal meanings” (Williams 185); modern advertising absolutely necessary for modern capitalism; conflict between capitalism and socialism is choice between man as consumer and man as user — advertising works to obscure this

‘consumers’: people seen as market; politics and culture deeply affected by dominant pattern of economics and consumption; advertising serves to protect the consumption ideal by showing consumption as fulfilling all human desires (respect, success, etc.); structure of feeling of advertising quite hostile, warlike imagery, emphasis on “impact”; structural similarities between advertising and modern art (see Jameson)

afterword: advertising and communications: coexistence of new technology and old social forms; submission of public interest to commercial interests; advertising as culprit?  “Advertising is the consequence of a social failure to find means of public information and decision over a wide range of everyday economic life.” (Williams 193)


UTOPIA AND SCIENCE FICTION

4 main types of utopia/dystopia:  (1) the paradise or the hell, (2) the externally altered world, (3) the willed transformation, (4) the technological transformation; relations to science fiction; willed transformation and technological transformation are characteristic utopian/dystopian modes, with the difference being one of agency v. instrumentality

‘scientific’ and ‘utopian’: Engels’s distinction between utopian and scientific socialism; distinction between humanist and scientific utopia

nineteenth-century utopias; systematic and heuristic futures

‘News from Nowhere’: focus on mode of transformation to utopia: revolution?

conflict and dystopia: mode of transformation as revolution, but also modernization

new heavens and hells: wary questioning of utopian impulse within its acceptance


THE WELSH INDUSTRIAL NOVEL

19th c. descriptions of industrial squalor (“industrial development,” politely) as hell; beginning step in movement towards industrial novel (“a movement towards describing what it is like to live in hell” [Williams 214])

Elizabeth Gaskell, Mary Barton

Welsh lateness in coming to the industrial novel; working-class community both delayed the novel and colored it once it appeared

informing principles of industrial novel: assumption that the lives of individuals are not just influenced but formed by social relations


NOTES ON MARXISM IN BRITAIN SINCE 1945

change in meaning of word “Marxist” since 1945; now inclusive of all Left

a terminological shift to the right

the three strands of theory: (1) “legitimating” theory — concerned with the legitimate inheritance of an authentic Marxism; (2) academic theory — “marxism” as distinct from “communism”; (3) “operative” theory — theoretical analysis of late capitalist society; most recently, we are in a predominantly academic period

populism: on the one hand, mobilization of “the people” against ruling class; on the other, developing “populism” of the Right

culturalism: Marxist cultural theory, development of “cultural materialism”: “a theory of culture as a (social and material) productive process and of specific practices, of ‘arts,’ as social uses of material means of production” (Williams 243); in the course of its development, however, these ideas were called “idealist” because they involved activities known to be superstructural

reformism: two kinds of reformist theory — one suggests that radical changes in social institutions can be made within the existing social order; the other claims the necessity of the transformation of the social order

conclusion


BEYOND ACTUALLY EXISTING SOCIALISM

what now has to be proved is not the necessity of communism, but the possibility

Bahro’s alternative in eastern Europe: alternative to “actually existing socialism”; “not a growth in production, but cultural revolution”

meanings of cultural revolution: at first a dismissive term, referring to those intellectuals with an interest in “superstructural” forms; then, the same phrase attached to the Chinese cultural revolution; now, same phrase again for revolution beyond actually existing socialism — how?

center of marxism as idea that social being determines consciousness; to change consciousness, one must first change social being — idealist/materialist opposition; “cultural revolution” considered idealist because it deals with consciousness; cultural revolution directed towards “the general appropriation of all the real forces of production, including now especially the intellectual forces of knowledge and conscious decision, as the necessary means of revolutionizing the social relations...which follow from variable forms of control of and access to all the productive forces” (Williams 257)

‘mature industrialism’: widely believed that full socialism will only be possible once industrial forces have matured, but given their present structure, they will never mature

‘surplus consciousness’; a long revolution; self-management

party, state, and plan: unitary decision-making forces v. collectivism

what a society produces: cultural revolution insists that consciousness is not a by-product of production of more material things, but something that must be produced in its own right; requires practical redefinition of “work”

class

conclusion
