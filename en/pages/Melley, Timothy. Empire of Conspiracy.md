Melley, Timothy.  Empire of Conspiracy:  The Culture of Paranoia in Postwar America.  Ithaca, NY:  Cornell University Press, 2000.

Preface

conspiracy theory as “fundamental form of American political discourse” (Melley vii); common both to those in power and those marginalized; “pervasive anxiety about social control” (Melley vii) — “agency panic” — anxiety about loss of autonomy

“The importance of agency panic, this book argues, lies in its troubled defense of an old but increasingly beleaguered concept of personhood — the idea that the individual is a rational, motivated agent with a protected interior core of beliefs, desires, and memories.” (Melley viii)

Introduction

Vance Packard, The Hidden Persuaders (1957); Hoover, Masters of Deceit (1958) — conspiracy either in capitalism or communism; Hofstadter: “paranoid style”

but after WW2, terror of paranoia shifts:  anxieties about domestic threat, esp. “mass media” (Melley 2); concerns about the media suggest not secret plot but open manipulation — diminished agency

concepts of structural (rather than individual) agency underwrite economic and social theories (see Althusser) as well as aesthetics, like literature naturalism — ideology

conspiracy theory functions to “sustain a form of individualism that seems increasingly challenged by postwar economic and social structures.  Conspiracy theory, paranoia, and anxiety about human agency, in other words, are all part of the paradox in which a supposedly individualist culture conserves its individualism by continually imagining itself to be in immediate peril.” (Melley 6)

Agency Panic

“Whether the postwar era is really an ‘age of conspiracy’ seems uncertain at best; the important fact is that many people belief it is such an age.” (Melley 7)

comfort of conspiracy theory — serves as master narrative

3 general observations about conspiracy-based narratives:  1.  “conspiracies are understood to be hermetically sealed, marvelously efficient, and virtually undetectable”; 2.  “conspiracies typically serve to conceptualize the relation between individuals and larger social bodies”; 3.  “conspiracy is often understood as a structure that curtails individuality, or is antithetical to individualism itself” (Melley 10)

“conspiracy theory...begins with individual self-protection” (10)

“To understand one’s relation to the social order through conspiracy theory, in other words, is to see oneself in opposition to ‘society.’  It is to endorse an all-or-nothing conception of agency, a view in which agency is a property...” (Melley 10)

such self-defensive postures considered “paranoid” — clinical paranoia — but not just a pathology; “broadly popular” (Melley 11) and on many ideological fronts

“the recent surge of conspiracy narratives stems not from a specific historical development — such as Watergate, the Kennedy assassination, or even the Cold War — but from the larger sense that, to quote one cultural critic, ‘our specialness — our humanness — has been taking it on the chin a lot lately.” (Melley 11) — diminished human agency — agency panic

two features of agency panic:  “a nervousness or uncertainty about the causes of individual action” (Melley 12) or fear of being programmed or controlled externally; “a secondary sense that controlling organizations are themselves agents — rational, motivated entities with the will and the means to carry out complex plans” (Melley 12-13) — transference of agency

paranoia — esp. political paranoia — nearly impossible to prove clinically

“conspiracy theory arises out of radical doubt about how knowledge is produced and about the authority of those who produce it” (Melley 13) — labeling “paranoid” is just another doubtful claim

goal is not to disprove or prove theories, or “to suggest that the authors mentioned here are panicked or, even worse, deluded” (Melley 14), but rather to explore the cultural significance of anxiety

anxieties indicate crisis in ideas of personhood/human agency — agency panic attempts to conserve model of “possessive individualism” — Hobbes/Locke — connections of dwindling agency with feminization; rugged individual = masculinist; Slotkin (regeneration through violence)

agency panic begins with revelation of the way social communications affect individual agency (radical insight), but then disavows revelation (conservative of traditional model of selfhood)

sharp contrast to poststructuralist/postmodern reconceptions of subjectivity “which have exploded the assumptions of liberal individualism” (Melley 15) — not mourning, but celebrating the end

“Agency panic... may be understood as a nervous acknowledgement, and rejection, of postmodern subjectivity.” (Melley 15)

appearance of agency panic in writing as “index of liberalism’s continuing appeal” (Melley 15)

Crises of Interpretation

paranoia as “an interpretive disorder” (Melley 16) — “in which one’s interpretations seem unfounded or abnormal to an interpretive community” (Melley 17) — hard to separate from “normal” interpretation

mode of psychoanalysis itself is redolent of paranoia; “Because diagnoses of paranoia depend upon a strong concept of reality — a conviction that the patient’s claims do not correspond to events transpiring in a measurable reality — the postmodern tendency to put ‘the real’ in quotation marks has undermined the pathologization of paranoia.” (Melley 17)

Freud & paranoia

Bodily Symptoms, Cultural Pathologies

agency panic as “a set of negotiations between sociological and psychological perspectives of human action” (Melley 31)

Influencing Machines

social controls represented as feminizing forces — see frontier myth — but here become a dangerous introjection of social forces into the self

despite masculinist implications, this belief can be deployed to feminist ends (feminizing as a hollowing-out of the female subject as well)

gender implications vary, but agency panic always romanticizes the liberal subject

connection of gender to images of machines — Kesey, Ellison

Postmodern Transference

agency panic partly a response to discourses that articulate new ideas about subjectivity, including postmodernism:  “The notion that individual actions or desires can be controlled by large systems is not unlike the theoretical proposition — now widely accepted in the humanities — that individuals are ‘constructed’ by powerful systems of knowledge or discourse.” (Melley 38)

cybernetics as another paranoia-inducing discourse; distinction between the totalizations of first-order systems theory and the multiplicity of second-order systems theory — systems become autonomous, thus undermining individual agency

The Representation of Social Control

chapters as case studies of anxieties about bureaucracy, bodies, conspiracies, addiction

1.  Bureaucracy and Its Discontents

The New Line of Americans

postwar sociological studies suggesting profound shift in American culture, arising from information sciences, systems theory, and cybernetics, but also from the information economy; shift from age of production to age of consumption (Riesman)

most frightening implication was the production in this new society of a new type of American (“organization man”; “one-dimensional man”) — generic and pliant

at the same time, bureaucratic systems seem to be spiraling out of control

narratives attempting to rally support for threatened form of American individualism

“The cultural work of these narratives, in other words, is not only to describe how postindustrial culture might diminish individual agency but also to offer an ‘antidote’ to that problem.  The antidote, interestingly enough, takes the form of a ‘paranoid’ suspicion of social connections — and a commitment to the idea that persons are atomistic units threatened by various forms of social communication and collective agency.” (Melley 49)

Social Characters

David Riesman, Jacques Ellul, William Whyte — shifts away from individualist, inner-directed individual to social-directed mass or organization man

Marcuse makes same argument from left perspective; “One-dimensional man, in other words, suffered from a terminal case of other-direction” (Melley 51)

narrative of individual versus society depicts a totalized, monolithic system responsible for eroding “liberal individualism’s fundamental assumptions, the most important of which include the following:  that persons are atomistic and autonomous; that they contain a protected ‘internal’ core of unique memories, desires, and ideas guaranteeing their individuality; and that ‘every man is naturally the sole proprietor of his own person and capacities...’” (Melley 53)

such possessive individualism assumes that the individual is self-made, acquiring its attributes through self-creation

in Riesman, the distinction between inner-directed and outer-directed individuals seems to come down to class; also gendered implications (Melley 55)

Paranoid Prescriptions

these narratives suggest that “collectives, organizations, and groups, despite their deceptively pleasant appearance, must be recognized as the true enemies of the individual” (Melley 56)

“To understand the organization as enemy, one must first make two tacit assumptions.  First, one must conceive of the organization not as a system of complex relationships and structures, but as a unified totality.  Second, one must imagine it as an active, living agency, against whose will to subdue and incorporate one must struggle.  In order to save the imperiled liberal agent from incorporation into a larger controlling body, in other words, that social body must itself be imagined as a liberal individual, as an agent with a coherence and identity of its own, a sort of superindividual.” (Melley 58)

The Shadow of the Firm

Riesman dates shift from Henry Ford’s death; end of era when organizations were shadows of men; instead now men are shadows of organizations

the “eclipsing of the heroic CEO” (Melley 59)

emphasizes “how this elegiac narrative invites an imaginative transfer of agency to the corporation as a totality.” (Melley 59)

opposition between autonomous individual and determined group “ensures that true creation can never be the result of a social process and, in so doing, protects the romantic notion of the individual agent as sole source of genius and creativity” (Melley 60)

such visions of the corporation are grounded in cybernetics and the anxieties it produces; from cybernetic perspective, “the idea that persons are regulated by larger systems is not a terrifying discovery but a basic assumption necessary for understanding human behavior” (Melley 63); for the individualist under threat, “adopting a cybernetic view seems suicidal because a cybernetic viewpoint, with its acceptance of systemic controls and its weakened sense of individuality, seems to be precisely what the system ‘wants’ us to adopt.” (Melley 63)

Anti-Socialism

reading of Heller’s Catch-22; Yossarian as individualist fighting bureaucratic systematization and incorporation

Bureaucratic Individuals

Heller, cont.

“Because the ‘inside’ is the site of individual difference and agency, a hollow individual can only be a symptom of a collective, anti-individualist logic” (Melley 69)

“The most basic strategy of the novel is to create characters who treat bureaucratic representations — official military reports and the like — as if they had absolute, ontological validity.” (Melley 71)

result is creation of “bureaucratic individuals,” “persons imagined as if they had been stripped of traditional human features:  not only individual difference... but also the ability to make reasonable judgments and the ability to act autonomously within the rationalized procedures of the military system” (Melley 72)

Syndicate-Nation

Milo Minderbinder’s syndicate as encompassing all the interests of the nation, while working against those interests and for corporate interests at the same time

Heller moves beyond simplistic ‘individual versus society’ dialectic:  “Riesman and Whyte locate resistance to the corporate ethic and the other-directed environment in a competitive, self-interested ‘Protestant ethic’ that would at best only advance corporate interests through increased individual competition.  Yossarian’s final repudiation of the military bureaucracy is significantly more radical because it suggests that nationalism and capitalism themselves — and not merely a new managerial ethic — are his enemies.” (Melley 78)

2.  Bodies Incorporated

Incoming Mail

opening of Gravity’s Rainbow creates a sense of bodily panic; agentic problem

“this agency problem and others like it mark a new way of thinking about the status of the body in relation to global communications and social systems, a radical reimagining of the relations between persons, bodies, and discursive structures.  I also show how this extraordinary conception of personhood induces episodes of agency panic — a response that not only registers anxieties about mass control, but helps to sustain the idea of autonomous individuality against such threats” (Melley 82)

GR demonstrates the tension in the term “agency” itself, often imagined as a pure volition or autonomy inhering in the subject “himself,” but originally signifying a kind of instrumentality, a middle-man empowered by someone else; what is thought of as being part of the self may thus in fact be dispersed into a system or network of control (Melley 83-84)

Pynchon’s texts specifically designed to make it impossible to fully localize agency, whether in individuals who lead conspiracies (Them), or in systems and structures — or whether in fact the perception of such agentic problems is paranoid

“Gravity’s Rainbow only puts into question whether persons are controlled or ‘constructed’ by discursive or social systems.  The uncanny sense of control conveyed by all of the novel’s very male ‘mail’ (rockets and letters alike) may be only the result of a paranoid reading of accidents.” (Melley 86)

connections to contemporary cultural theory:  Derrida/Lacan on the letter

Abrams’ defense of humanist criticism employs a reading the poststructuralist theory as a system in which people are reduced from agents (in the newer sense) to agencies (in the older), not users of but tools of language

The Body We Can Measure

Wiener on the relationship between the human body and the development of the rocket during WWII

self as guided by “servo-mechanism”?

“Because cybernetics posits an essential similarity between humans and servo-controlled machines, as well as other kinds of self-regulating systems, it generates challenges to the notion that self-control is a property only of embodied, human subjects.  And it does so by identifying self-control (or ‘autopoiesis,’ to use the language of systems theory) as a quality of machines, collective entities, and social systems.” (Melley 88)

Kittler:  self-guided weapons of WWII undermine modern notion of subjectivity

Wiener and the connection between transmission of messages and transmission of bodies

GR’s interest in the sending of messages with human bodies (Melley 89)

secret held by Slothrop’s body promises to be the secret of the novel; “a locus in which global information and individual sexual desire have been coordinated in a single, hidden, regulatory formula” (Melley 90)

two sciences applied to Slothrop’s body:  Pavlovian psychology (Pointsman) and statistics (Mexico); each represents a methodology of reading — hermeneutics v. poetics — but “these competing methodologies function as elements of a single strategy” (Melley 91)

GR’s attribution of consciousness to all kinds of systems (atomic, cellular, cartel, economic, technological) “typifies the crisis of threatened agency in this novel and beyond it.  A self-regulating (social) system appears to threaten a model of personhood in which the individual human body is the privileged site of autonomous, original, motivated social action; in an attempt to conserve the attributes of this model of individuality, individuals assign those attributes to the system as a whole, but they also recognize that the system may govern itself through aggregate effects and that the logic of individual motive and agency will not quite work to explain it.  The result is panic about the difficulty of locating control at any one level of existence — the difficulty, in other words, in deciding what a person is.” (Melley 94)

Pornographies of Deduction

Stephen Dodson-Truck’s voyeurism:  “We’re all such mechanical men... I’m an impotent man” (Melley 216)

Statistical Oddities

GR’s ideas of power read through Foucault, esp. History of Sexuality

Personalities Replaced by Abstractions of Power

Mark Seltzer’s notion of “statistical persons”

3.  Stalked by Love

Alien Invaders

Margaret Atwood, Surfacing; presumed existence of male persecutor and fragmented subjectivity of female victim “makes possible a powerful social conception of violence against women, a crime that is too often viewed as a result of individual male behavior” (Melley 107) — so what, is he suggesting that women’s fears of male violence are paranoid, and that individual men aren’t to blame?

“the sheer difficulty of sorting out ‘paranoid’ from ‘valid’ interpretations is one of the factors allowing the psychoanalytic theory of paranoia to function as a ‘technology of gender’ — Teresa de Lauretis’s term for those gendered forms of social control exerted through institutions, discourses, and social relations” (Melley 108)

“the stalker figure offers [Atwood and Johnson] one way out of the dilemma I have been tracing through postwar culture:  how to conserve a sense of individual agency, identity, and volition, while still accounting for the way institutions, discourses, and practices shape individual experience.  In order to accomplish this goal — in this case, to make visible the social sources of antifemale violence while also accounting for women’s desires and choices — the stalkers in these narratives must have the ontological status of ghosts, present in the material world, yet never simply individual agents.” (Melley 110)

Female Paranoia

Freud on paranoia; the case of a female patient feeling persecuted by a man ran counter to psychoanalytic theory of paranoia for Freud, which “always” stemmed from repressed homosexual desire

Freud re-reads her description of the event, changing the details to posit repressed lesbianism; “This is an interesting denouement, not only because it conforms so well to the conventions of the detective novel, but because in order to reach it Freud himself must replicate the essential gestures of the paranoiac” (Melley 113), pursuing invisible clues and blaming an external, hidden agent

female patient’s “association of persecution with the exposure of her body to male surveillance” (Melley 114)

paranoiac’s claims of being watched tied to feminization — penetration

paradoxical combination of intentional and yet anonymous malevolence in stalker novels (Melley 117)

A Distrust of Surfaces

novels question whether female characters’ sense of persecution is best understood through psychology (individual) or sociology (group)

“there might be a theoretical advantage to being unable to pin one’s persecution on an individual — because the problem of stalking may stem not from single, deviant individuals but from a larger complex of social institutions, narratives, and conditions.  There might also be something reassuring about the conception of selfhood used to imagine the stalker himself.  That is, the idea of a single, efficient persecutor might offer a strange sort of comfort to someone whose own self-control seems threatened by an array of social institutions.” (Melley 121)

question of whether anorexia signifies massive triumph of self-control or total domination by cultural standards of beauty stems from assumption that agency can only be resident either in the individual or in “society” – “it is not possible to solve such paradoxes by simply ‘assigning’ causality to either individual or social agents.  The sheer difficulty of separating external controls from internal controls is part of what generates crises of agency in the first place.” (Melley 126)

Abnormally Normal

realization that violence against women and other “abnormalities” are in fact “normal”

Anonymous Effects

4.  Secret Agents

Lone Gunman and Social Body

experience of mass-mediated JFK assassination was collective, and yet must offer up an individual responsible body

increasing belief in conspiracy — massive embodiment of collective power — a bizarre kind of utopian collectivism in refusal to accept individualist explanation?

obsession w/ JFK case originates in its modeling of the agency panic problem, in oscillating between grand conspiracy and lone-gunman theories

examination of the cultural function of the debate — not really a debate; rather keeps “two apparently rival, but actually complementary, notions about the relations of persons to the social order” in circulation (Melley 135)

an “uncanny similarity” in the two sides:  “If the Warren Commission’s lone-gunman theory triggers guilt about the lone gunman being a patsy for the social, the grand conspiracy theories such as Stone’s tend to conserve — albeit in a collective ‘body’ — the classic attributes of the individual agent.” (Melley 136)

Libra’s alternating-chapter structure explores dialectic between two narratives

Archaeological Details

epistemological crisis produced by assassination — impossibility of producing a coherent, believable narrative

distinction between history (interpretive) and archaeology (Foucauldian; not subject-based) — differing conceptions of historical agency:  “while traditional interpretive historiography attempts to locate an ultimate cause in a central subject or ‘headquarters,’ archaeology finds causality dispersed in a ‘network’ of institutions, discourses, and laws beyond the intentional control of any individual or group” (Melley 142)

“theory of social conspiracy” — misapprehension of social system as conspiracy — posits mysterious ‘headquarters’ directing otherwise standard dispersed social operations — “quasi-supernatural” (Melley 144)

“The theory of social conspiracy thus recuperates the ‘decentered’ subject in a sense, assigning to the collective agency of the conspiracy the supposedly lost qualities of the individual:  self-presence, individual unity, autonomy, and a protected ‘interior’ as the site of identity.” (Melley 145)

A Cardboard Cutout

in Libra, conspirators build a cardboard-cutout individual that Oswald then fits; is he a cardboard cutout, the product of a social conspiracy?

“One of the reasons Oswald, like so many Americans, can view mass communications as the products of a unified and controlling subject is that he sees agency as a property that is assigned, in an all-or-nothing manner, to himself or to ‘society’ conceived as a totality.  His ‘paranoia’ about control is only an extension of the popular belief that social massages (advertisements, movies, television shows) issue from a monolithic force, from which one should struggle to free oneself.” (Melley 147)

Oswald’s determination to evade control puts him in the path of the conspiracy

masculinist ‘regenerative’ violence as individualist ‘solution’ to the threat of social control

Mark Seltzer on serial killers:  ‘an addiction to self-making or self-transformation’; Oswald’s attempts to evade control through self-making only undo his identity — self-canceling

“For Oswald, then, the work of historical self-construction is part of the endless business of beating social determinants to the punch, writing history before it writes you” (Melley 150)

The Secrets of the Masses

“a misrecognition of generic, social (indeed, socialist) messages for private communications and sources of individual identity” (Melley 152)

massness of media address contradicts its apparent enunciation of individuality [\*\*\*this is mine, not his, though drawn from his ideas; I think this is the key to the network chapter, to some extent — when the media addresses the individual (be unique! drink Sprite!), it’s easy to overlook the massness of that address — P&D attempt to restore that awareness of the mass in mass media]

“DeLillo repeatedly demonstrates that, in modern consumer culture, our most ‘private’ individual qualities, our deepest ‘secrets,’ may be no more than the ‘individual wrap’ we require on our consumer products.” (Melley 153)

simultaneous massness and atomism of American individual:  “men in small rooms” — anxieties about the failure of Thoreauvian self-reliance

Central Intelligence

dispersal of intelligence in Libra — no ‘headquarters’ governing the system; decentralized power

Libra renounces reductive all-or-nothing views of agency/conspiracy for the view that actions may “instead be governed by a web of motives, exchanges, decisions, ideologies, and habits, all of which are influenced by the structure of social systems.” (Melley 159)

5.  The Logic of Addiction

Bad Habits

addiction as underlying structure of contemporary American life — absence of self-control, both “utterly normal and dangerously pathological” (Melley 162) — stems from agency panic

basic human activities appear to be addictions if (1) one assumes individuals should be rational, self-controlled agents; (2) one believes in “a strict metaphysics of inside and outside” (Melley 162); and (3) one views control as indivisible, internal or external:  “Only in the context of these assumptions can any less than perfectly willed behavior seem to be the product of dangerous external controls” (Melley 163)

addiction industry as response to agency panic

Burroughs:  addiction as figure for other postindustrial conspiracies; addiction as “virus”

Control Addicts

addiction to control as both tautological and self-liquidating

addiction as dehumanizing; addicts as insects

The Junk Virus

writing as ‘organism’ and ‘pharmakon’ — druglike quality of writing (Derrida on Phaedrus)

language as virus; communications, like addiction, as enemies of self

Cellular Panic

human beings as “soft machines”; individual cells of body function separately as parts of machine

Haraway on postmodern biology/biopolitics; D&G on “body without organs” — when these postmodern/posthumanist views meet possessive individualism, “the result is often agency panic” (Melley 174), as seen in Burroughs

“On the one hand, Burroughs exhibits a radical, posthumanist tendency to question whether humans are self-governing agents.  On the other hand, he exhibits a humanist refusal to modify the traditional model of the agent, which he applies to other, nonhuman entities.” (Melley 175)

Reconditioning Centers

relationship between “junky” and “queer” — perversions of liberal body

link between drugs and electronic culture — TV as “plug-in drug”

N. Wiener’s explicit association of entropy w/ evil, fascism, mass culture
Epilogue:  Corporate Futures

Postmodern Constructs

continuing debate between social constructionist and liberal individualist models of selfhood

texts most apparently schizophrenic (and thus postmodern) are also most paranoid (and thus modern) — movement away from centered, autonomous subject is “accompanied by a corresponding and paradoxical desire to conserve that self” (Melley 186)

cyberpunk represents extreme versions of both challenges to individual subjectivity and agency panic

cyberpunk thus still participates in myth of liberal individualism; resurrects personhood in corporation

Conclusion

posthumanism countered by “inertial power and mythic appeal” of humanism (Melley 201)

“many of our most radical encounters with the decentered subject are presented to us in the mode of panic, by terrified characters and worried cultural critics” (Melley 201)
