INTRODUCTION:  CASE STUDIES AND CULTURAL LOGISTICS

--The Problem of the Body in Machine Culture

"this book traces the relays between the natural and the technological that make up what might be called the American body-machine complex" (Seltzer 3)

redrawing what Theodore Veblen called "the 'vague and shifting' line between 'the animate and the inanimate' and between the natural and the unnatural in turn-of-the-century American culture" (Seltzer 3)

"traces the remaking of nature in terms of the *naturalist machine* and the remaking of individuals as *statistical persons*" (Seltzer 3)

"attempts to map the psychotropography of machine culture" (Seltzer 4)

possessive individualism and market culture v. disciplinary individualism and machine culture

--Agencies of Expression

--Bodies in Motion

"the transposition of the character of the energy-converting machine and the character of the natural body: not the demotion of a living body to the machine but their intimate correlation" (Seltzer 13)

--Intimacy with Machines

"The principle of locomotion which in liberal market culture is the sign of agency is in machine culture the sign of automatism" (Seltzer 17)

railroads have been read as part of the American passion for movment, but as Seltzer points out, they're much more ambiguous than that:  "the railway system combines mobility and incarceration, confining still or stilled bodies in moving machines directed by mechanical prime movers" (Seltzer 18) -- transfer of motion/agency to machine


I.  THE NATURALIST MACHINE

anxiety about production and generation; 'counter-model of generation' in the naturalist novel deals with linked problems of production and reproduction

--Production and Generation

steam power as generative:  "the procreative force of the machine" (Seltzer 27)

thermodynamic laws at work in naturalist novel (including entropy)

Henry Adams, the virgin and the dynamo -- generative/productive

mining v. farming -- mining can do away with body, female, generative

--Perverse *Accouchements*

ways in which the "thermodynamic technology of power" (Seltzer 35) is promoted by the techniques of the naturalist narrative

"What the naturalist aesthetic requires, then, is a principle of generation that incorporates rather than opposes the machine:  in short, a mechanics that forms part of its very textuality" (Seltzer 36)

inextricability of life and death:  Joseph Le Conte -- "all life is 'generated by decomposition'" (Seltzer 39)

Seltzer points out the "application of thermodynamics to vital processes int he late nineteenth century" (Seltzer 39) and the "medicalization" of late nineteenth-century American society (Seltzer 42) -- both involve the treatement of the human body as a machine, as a means of Foucauldian control

--The Mechanics of Writing

"the naturalist machine operates through a double discourse by which the apparently opposed registers of the body and the machine are coordinated within a single technology of regulation" (Seltzer 44)

using Foucault's notion of "biopolitics," Seltzer describes how this correlation of body and machine produced, in the late nineteenth century, "a single technology of regulation" (Seltzer 44), a control

in the late twentieth century, it seems, we have no meand by which to think ourselves out of this correlation with the machine; the proliferation of machines has only increased our self-identification with them, as has the rise of the field from which Seltzer's metaphors of connection -- "relays, transit points, paths of least resistance" (Seltzer 4) -- arise:  electronics.  We need no longer metaphorize the body as machine; instead, we are wired together


II.  PHYSICAL CAPITAL:  THE ROMANCE OF THE MARKET IN MACHINE CULTURE

--Persons and Things

Stowe's statement of the difference between a person and a thing (feeling):  "What is peculiar about this passage, of course, is not what it says but rather the perverse necessity of stating what ought to go without saying" (Seltzer 47-48) -- betrays an "uncertainty about the relations between persons and things" (Seltzer 48)

"the notion of 'The American' as an artifact and product, something mass-produced and reproduced" (Seltzer 49)

competitive individualism v. disciplinary individualism (market v. machine culture)

the "romance" -- i.e., story? -- of the market in machine culture

--Typical Americans

move from producer to consumer?

"the uncertain agency of production" (Seltzer 51) = the agency of observation/control -- conflicts of market and machine culture

-- Culturalism and Consumerism

quoting Kopytoff:  "The fashioning of typical Americans foregrounds the permeability of the boundaries between persons and things and between the individual and the typical in commodity culture: the 'conceptual polarity of individualized persons and commoditized things is recent and, culturally speaking, exceptional'" (Seltzer 59)

narrative of "fall" from the natural to the cultural (Seltzer 60) -- see LAsch and Ewen

--Romantic Property

--Status, Contract, Discipline

--The Paper System

--Market Culture and Machine Culture


III.  STATISTICAL PERSONS

--How the Other Half Loods

"two of the crucial control-technologies of machine-culture:  statistics and surveillance" (Seltzer 100)

--The Body-Machine Complex

W. James's psychology -- treatment of the mind as a "physical machine"

--Working Models


IV.  THE STILL LIFE

--The Aesthetics of Consumption

--Agoraphilia

--The Girl-Man

--Still Lives

"One of the most familiar critiques of the culture of consumption, as we have seen, takes the form of a general critique of illusionism.  The scandal of the mass culture of consumption is, for commentators both on the cultural right (Lasch, Bell) and the cultural left (Lukàcs and, in part, Bourdieu), the scandal of a fall into representationalism, illusionism, or simulation" (Seltzer 141)

--Mechanical Prime Movers


V.  THE LOVE-MASTER

--The Anthropology of Boys

"the craft of making men was the antidote to anxieties about the *depletion* of agency and virility in consumer and machine culture" (Seltzer 149)

"nothing typifies the American sense of identity more than the love of nature (nature's nation) except perhaps its love of technology (made in America)" (Seltzer 152)

--Making Men

--Living Diagrams

transformation of market by increasing administrative control; replacement of "invisible hand" of market economy with "visible hand" of managerial economy; "standardization" includes replacement of animate with inanimate, mechanisms (Seltzer 156)

James Benigle, "the control revolution"

--National Geographics

--Men in Furs
