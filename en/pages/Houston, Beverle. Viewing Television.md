Houston, Beverle.  "Viewing Television: The Metapsychology of Endless Consumption."  Quarterly Review of Film Studies 9.3 (Summer 1984): 183-95.


"The project of this essay is to make some distinctions between the positions offered for the spectator by American television -- especially network and pay-cable, with some mention of cassette viewing -- in comparison with those offered by mainstream cinema, especially with respect to issues of desire" (Houston 183)

"Television structures a very different relationship between imaginary and symbolic [than does film], between a dream of wholeness and the lack that motors it.  Institutionally and formally, television insists upon the repetitive reformulation of desire.  Rather than suturing the viewer further into a visually re-evoked dream of plenitude, it keeps the ego at a near-panic level of activity, trying, virtually from moment to moment, to control the situation, trying to take some satisfaction, to get some rest from the constant changes, which repeatedly give the lie to television's fervent, body-linked promise.  In short, I will try to show that among the pleasures television produces, that of specular mastery is not primary; rather, television offers rhythmic, obsessive, mitigated positions dependent in part on taking something like pleasure in the terror of desire itself" (Houston 183-84)

"Television sets up an obsessive acting-out of desire, which the spectator tries to assuage by consuming the television text itself in its unique promise.  Of television we say:  I always want it as I have never had it" (Houston 184)

"This process is motored by American broadcast television's primary contradiction:  it offers an extraordinarily strong promise of endless flow, which is repeatedly blocked for the spectator by interruption in the delivery of the text" (Houston 184)

"Whereas the specularity of cinema's promise evokes the misrecognition of the mirror, and can do so only in the presence of its images, television's promise evokes a much earlier moment and can do so all the time, even when the set is off.  In its endless flow of text, it suggests the first flow of nourishment in and from the mother's body, evoking a moment when the emerging sexual drive is still closely linked to -- propped on -- the life-and-death urgency of the feeding instinct" (Houston 184)

"The promise of television is thus not primarily visual, though that has its place, as I will discuss later.  Its unique promise is actually more linked with the possibility of liveness, not only in the sense of simultaneity, but more especially in the sense of coextensiveness noted above" (Houston 184)

"this flow is available in the home, the privileged location of the everyday and the psychological.  Thus television's promise is intensified by a certain relation to materiality.  Not only does it lean on the world's body -- that is to say, in its liveness -- but it is available domestically at all moments -- that is to say, in its livedness" (Houston 184)

"The work of the symbolic, of the American television institution, in articulating this technical and imaginary possibility is to break it, interrupt, withdraw it by separating the text into salable parts, breaking up the promise of coherence and wholeness into short sessions, as it were, constantly jerking us out of the dream of coherent signifieds into the world of the endless play of signifiers" (Houston 185)

"discrete, regulated entities -- small, discontinuous, easily consumable like the bits of information on a computer screen" (Houston 185)

television as "bad object"

"The viewer, in turning on the television, succumbs to the promise of the flow in order to reiterate the pleasure of the return after disruption" (Houston 186)

"Those who buy, make, and schedule programming for American broadcast television are well aware of the power of spectacle and its various sutures -- the cinema effect -- in gaining the consent of the audience to tolerate interruption" (Houston 187)

"Television's apparatus also includes a channel changer (as well as the off/on switch noted earlier).  Our knowledge that we may exercise conscious choice at the slightest sign of dissatisfaction further weakens our chance of immersion; in its suggestion of better possibilities, the channel changer reiterates lack" (Houston 188)

"I would like to offer the notion that the strategies of the television institution, enunciation, and apparatus that I have been discussing put all its spectators -- both male and female -- into a situation that is, in many ways, much like the one that has been theorized for the feminine subject and spectator, but which is, in fact, available for all subjects" (Houston 189)

multiple identifications, interruption, deferral, waiting, all "put all of television's spectators into the situation provided for the feminine in theories of subjectivity as well as in her actual development and practice in patriarchy.  Television in America requires these forms of behavior, not at the margins of avant-garde alterity or even in special texts produced for and about women, but right at the center of the mainstream of what is arguably -- for better or for worse -- America's most powerful dispenser of text-for-consumption" (Houston 189)

"Having suggested the obsessive reiteration of desire and consumption as television's primary model for negotiating relations between the imaginary and the symbolic through contradiction between flow and interruption, having detailed the formal and technical means by which television's delivery of its text further inflects this position, and having developed certain implications concerning gender, I would like to return to a consideration of interruption itself as a historical and class-linked phenomenon" (Houston 189-90)

relationship between economic exchange (of pay-tv; of feature-length cinema) and absence of interruptions
