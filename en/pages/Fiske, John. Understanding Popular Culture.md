PREFACE

“a theory of popular culture in capitalist societies” (Fiske ix)


CHAPTER 1: THE JEANING OF AMERICA

jeans as most popular cultural product; functional, yes, but functionality “has little to do with culture, which is concerned with meanings, pleasures, and identities rather than efficiency.” (Fiske 1)

two main foci of jeans as youth and working-class; “but these foci should be seen as semiotic rather than sociological, that is, as centers of meaning rather than social categories.” (Fiske 1)

jeans’ lack of differentiation as freedom of expression? or as repressive uniformity?  “a telling paradox that the desire to be oneself leads one to wear the same garment as everyone else” (Fiske 2-3)

connotations of physical labor, ruggedness, as attempt to deny class differences

naturalness and sexuality; meaning cluster inflected towards strength, sport, for men, and towards sexuality for women?

jeans and the cowboy; Americanness of jeans

jeans were oppositional in 60s; now, to be oppositional, must be disfigured (though disfigurement is not a complete rejection)

“wearing torn jeans is an example of the contradictions that are so typical of popular culture, where what is to be resisted is necessarily present in the resistance to it.” (Fiske 4); popular culture as culture of the subordinated and disempowered; thus, always bears traces of forces of domination

importance of contradiction in popular culture: can entail expression of both domination and subordination; entails semiotic richness and polysemy

“Of course, the manufacturers of jeans are aware of all this and attempt to exploit it for their commercial interests.” (Fiske 5) — for Fiske, popular reaction comes before commercial exploitation

“All meanings are ultimately intertextual — no one text, no one advertisement can ever bear the full meanings of jeans, for this can exist only in that ill-defined cultural space between texts” (Fiske 6)

brand-name jeans appealing to specific segments of the market; use advertising to give meanings to product differences so people in targeted social formation will recognize themselves

designer jeans as moving away from shared values; “Jeans’ semiotic shift from the left [generic jeans] to the right [designer jeans] is partly a way in which grass-roots myths of America can be incorporated into a contemporary, urbanized, commodified society” (Fiske 7) — jeans moving into a world where social/class distinctions are all-important; also, gender differences

THE COMMERCIAL AND THE POPULAR

the relationship between popular culture and the forces of commerce and profit

“differences between a user of a cultural resource and a consumer of a commodity” (Fiske 11)

ways of understanding commodities: two types of function, material and cultural; “Describing a pair of jeans, or a TV program, as a commodity emphasizes its role in the circulation of wealth and tends to play down its separate, but related, role in the circulation of meaning . . . This difference of emphasis (on money or meanings) carries with it a corresponding difference in conceptualizing the balance of power within the exchange.” (Fiske 11)

looking at culture as commodity puts power with producers; when this approach turns to look at meaning, it uses a theory of ideology which keeps the power under the owners of the means of prod.

torn jeans as a display of poverty?  “But more significant than any other possible meaning of ragged jeans is the fact that the raggedness is the production and choice of the user, it is an excorporation of the commodity into a subordinate subculture and a transfer of at least some of the power inherent in the commodification process.” (Fiske 15)

excorporation as central to popular culture, process by which the subordinate make their own culture out of the resources and commodities provided by the dominant system

“popular culture is necessarily the art of making do with what is available.  This means that the study of popular culture requires the study not only of the cultural commodities out of which it is made, but also of the ways that people use them.” (Fiske 15)

producers forced to resort to incorporation or containment; production of ragged jeans in factory — incorporation of signs of resistance into dominant system attempts to rob them of oppositional meanings; signs of opposition turned to advantage of that which they oppose

but this is only part of the story: concentrate on power of dominant groups; assume rather than question the success of their strategies (distinctions between naturally-torn and pre-torn jeans); this kind of study paradoxically aligns itself with dominant by ignoring powers of subordinate

guerrilla tactics as the “art of the weak” (Fiske 19); “semiotic guerrilla warfare” as key to understanding popular culture’s ability to resist dominant ideology

social change as coming from “below”; from conflicts of interest in social differences

“Popular culture always is part of power relations; it always bears traces of the constant struggle between domination and subordination, between power and various forms of resistance to it or evasions of it, between military strategy and guerrilla tactics.” (Fiske 19)

“Until recently, the study of popular culture has taken two main directions.  The less productive has been that which has celebrated popular culture without situating it in a model of power. . . . The other direction has been to situate popular culture firmly within a model of power, but to emphasize so strongly the forces of domination as to make it appear impossible for a genuine popular culture to exist at all.” (Fiske 20)

third direction: accepts power of forces of dominance, but focuses instead on tactics by which these forces are coped with and evaded — “This approach sees popular culture as potentially, and often actually, progressive (though not radical), and it is essentially optimistic, for it finds in the vigor and vitality of the people evidence both of the possibility of social change and of the motivation to drive it.” (Fiske 21)


CHAPTER 2: COMMODITIES AND CULTURE

FORMATIONS OF THE PEOPLE

“Popular culture in industrial societies is contradictory to its core.  On the one hand it is industrialized — its commodities produced and distributed by a profit-motivated industry that follows only its own economic interests.  But on the other hand, it is of the people, and the people’s interests are not those of the industry — as is evidence by the number of films, records, and other products (of which the Edsel is only the most famous) that the people make into expensive failures.  To be made into popular culture, a commodity must also bear the interests of the people.  Popular culture is not consumption, it is culture — the active process of generating and circulating meanings and pleasures within a social system” (Fiske 23)

“mass culture” as such a contradication in terms that it cannot exist; culture cannot be sold ready-made to the masses

“the people” as sociological category; does not exist in objective reality — “the people” as a shifting set of social allegiances — “all social allegiances have not only a sense of with whom, but also of against whom: indeed, I would argue that the sense of oppositionality, the sense of difference, is more determinant than that of similarity” (Fiske 24)

popular culture must be relevant, above all: oppositional meanings can only be read within and against the dominant forces

“Popular culture is made by the people at the interface between the products of the culture industries and everyday life. . . . The fact that the system provides only commodities, whether cultural or material, does not mean that the process of consuming those commodities can be adequately described as one that commodifies the people into a homogenized mass at the mercy of the barons of industry.” (Fiske 25)

THE COMMODITIES OF CULTURE

THE TWO ECONOMIES OF TELEVISION

two economies: financial (circulates wealth) and cultural (circulates meanings)

financial: 1. production company produces program, sells it to ditributor; 2. program produces audience, sells it to advertiser

cultural: audience as producer of meanings; original commodity becomes text

contradictory needs which must be met by cultural commodities: economic (domination) v. cultural (subversion) — “the double movement of containment and resistance” (S. Hall)

diversity of society; “There is no social difference without power difference” (Fiske 30)

“The polysemic openness of popular texts is required by social differences and is used to maintain, question, and think through those differences.” (Fiske 30)

EVERYDAY LIFE

de Certeau as theorist of everyday life; uses metaphors of conflict

“The powerful construct ‘places’ where they can exercise their power — cities, shopping malls, schools, workplaces and houses, to name only some of the material ones.  The weak make their own ‘spaces’ within those places” (Fiske 32)

everyday life as the art of making do

“What is distributed is not completed, finished goods, but the resources of everyday life, the raw material from which popular culture constitutes itself.  Every act of consumption is an act of cultural production, for consumption is always the production of meaning.” (Fiske 35)

products of tactical consumption as elusive (they have no place, only space), camouflaged

object of analysis (and basis of theory of everyday life) is not products/commodities, but the uses they are put to

importance of the “trickster” and the “guileful ruse” in creation of popular culture: “misuse” of cultural commodities

DEFINING THE POPULAR

“There can be no popular dominant culture, for popular culture is formed always in reaction to, and never as part of, the forces of domination.” (Fiske 43)

multiple readings of mass cultural texts:  hegemonic, corporate, resistant

“The Americanness of American popular cultural commodities is often, in other nations, used to express opposition to the forces of domination within those societies.” (Fiske 44)

role of the critic/analyst: “not to reveal the true or hidden meanings of the text, or even to trace the readings that people make of it; rather, it is to trace the play of power in the social formation” (Fiske 45)


CHAPTER 3: PRODUCTIVE PLEASURES

attempts to theorize the role of pleasure in culture all desire to divide pleasure into two categories, whether aesthetically (high v. low), politically (reactionary v. revolutionary), discursively (making meanings v. accepting meanings), physiologically (pleasures of spirit v. pleasures of body), disciplinary (exerting v. evading power)

Fiske emphasizing popular pleasures over hegemonic ones (more disreputable side of antithesis)

two main forms of the work of popular pleasure: evasion (or offensiveness) and productivity

evasion centers on the body (Barthes: jouissance and plaisir); “Jouissance is not a quality of the text, it cannot be identified by analysis; it occurs in the body of the reader at the moment of reading when text and reader erotically lost their separate identities and become a new, momentarily produced body that is theirs and theirs alone, that defies meaning or discipline.” (Fiske 51)

plaisir as socially produced, with roots in the dominant ideology; if jouissance produces the pleasures of evading the social order, plaisir produces those of relating to it — but plaisir is only pleasurable because it is produced by those experiencing it; it does not come from outside

“I find it helpful to categorize popular pleasures into two types — those of evasion, which center around the body and which socially tend to cause offense and scandal, and those of producing meanings, which center around social identity and social relations, and work socially through semiotic resistance to hegemonic force.” (Fiske 56)

politics of popular culture as micropolitics, affecting tactics of everyday life; pleasures of micropolitics are in producing meanings that are both relevant and functional

embarrassment as key pleasure: “Embarrassment is, I suggest, experienced at the point of conflict between the conventional and the subversive, between the dominant and the subordinate, between top-down and bottom-up power.” (Fiske 64)


CHAPTER 4: OFFENSIVE BODIES AND CARNIVAL PLEASURES

pleasures of evasion: centered on body

STRATEGIES OF DISCIPLINE

disciplinary energy of the bourgeois directed toward the leisure of the working classes

two main strategies: repressive legislation and appropriation

“The discourses that were overwhelmingly favored to promote this control were those of morality, law and order, and the Protestant work ethic; that of class interest was, not surprisingly, repressed, and was only used by those who attempted to oppose the process.” (Fiske 71)

“The class-based nature of such discourse reveals itself in two main ways — the first is the paternalistic tone with which the concern for the morality of the lower orders is expressed . . . The other is the defense of middle- or upper-class leisure activities, which, on the face of it, might have appeared identical to those being made illegal for the lower classes.” (Fiske 74)

pleasures of the body as threat to social order (pleasures of individual body as threat to body politic)

appropriation: redefining, repositioning, and regulating pleasure; attempting to impose middle-class meanings and behaviors on lower-class leisure

middle-class also appropriated upper-class culture, with middle-class meanings

control over meanings and behaviors of the body as a prime disciplinary apparatus

THE CARNIVALESQUE

Bakhtin’s theory of the carnival, to account for the differences between the life proposed by the social order and the repressed pleasures of the subordinate

ROCK ‘N’ WRESTLING

the spectacular: involves an exaggeration of the pleasure of looking; liberates from subjectivity

the grotesque as linked to a sense of earthy realism; contradictory pleasures of attraction and repulsion

Bourdieu: middle-class cultural forms allow for little bodily involvement on the part of the audience; working-class cultural forms “involve intense verbal and bodily participation, strong partisanship and involvement” (Fiske 90)

BODILY CONTROL

the politicization of the body in patriarchal capitalism: “The body is where the power-bearing definitions of social and sexual normality are, literally, embodied, and is consequently the site of discipline and punishment for deviation from those norms.” (Fiske 90)

de Certeau: juridical law as only effective if people have bodies on which it can be imposed

law writes itself on the body

health and beauty as sociopolitical; the body as intextuated

medicine as a disciplinary discourse (e.g. AIDS as “an epidemic of meaning” [Treichler])

fatness as defiance, resistance, empowering

bodybuilders: “Making norms spectacular rather than naturalizing them is a potentially subversive semiotic practice: it is the naturalized and thus invisible norms that perform their ideological and disciplinary work most effectively.” (Fiske 94)

pain as spectacle; removed from tool of social control

aestheticization of the body meant to disguise the fact that the body provides capitalist labor

the sporting male body as an active hegemonic agent

grotesque realism of ugly body in opposition to forces of domination

can be argued that “because carnival’s disruptive moment is licensed by the prevailing order it is  finally recuperated into that order” (Fiske 100)


CHAPTER 5: POPULAR TEXTS

THE PRODUCERLY TEXT

Barthes: readerly and writerly texts

producerly as the “popular” writerly text — not difficult, but doesn’t impose laws of its own construction; accessible but open; do not require a writerly reader but cannot prevent it

analyzing popular texts requires dual focus: focus on deep structure of text complemented by focus on how people actually read the text

LANGUAGE

do the mass media and popular culture debase language or revitalize it?  and why does its use of language cause such offense?

the pleasure of the pun; pleasure of discovery and decoding of irony

de Certeau’s distinction between reading and decipherment: decipherment = langue, official language; reading = parole, oral, practical, vernacular language

puns: writerly v. producerly; puns in ads and pop songs; simultaneous pleasure and displeasure in puns: “Our pleasure derives from the creativity of the release from linguistic discipline, our displeasure from our social investment in the system that is momentarily scandalized.” (Fiske 111)

puns as essentially oral; bastardized form of language; oralized script

EXCESS AND THE OBVIOUS

pop culture as excessive and obvious; excess as “overflowing semiosis” (Fiske 114); “Norms that are exceeded lose their invisibility, lose their status as natural common sense, and are brought out into the open agenda.” (Fiske 114)

tabloid headlines as sensational examples of the inability of the “normal” to explain or cope with specific instances of everyday life

“The sensational is the excessive failure of the normal” (Fiske 116)

popularity of tabloids as evidence of extent of dissatisfaction in a society

cliches: “the commonsense, everyday articulations of the dominant ideology” (Fiske 118)

CONTRADICTIONS AND COMPLEXITY

TEXTUAL POVERTY AND INTERTEXTUALITY

popular culture circulates intertextually, among primary texts (a pair of jeans), secondary texts (ads, criticism), and tertiary texts (conversations, ways of wearing jeans)

repetition, seriality


CHAPTER 6: POPULAR DISCRIMINATION

“The people discriminate among the products of the culture industries, choosing some and rejecting others in a process that often takes the industry by surprise . . . Popular discrimination is concerned with functionality rather than quality . . . Three main criteria underlie this selection process: relevance, semiotic productivity, and the flexibility of the mode of consumption.” (Fiske 129)

RELEVANCE

“The pleasures of popular culture lie in perceiving and exploiting these points of pertinence and in selecting those commodities from the repertoire produced by the culture industries that can be used to make popular sense out of popular social experience.” (Fiske 133)

no confusion of social with textual; social meanings always win in any conflict; therefore popular texts can be progressive but can never be revolutionary/radical

“However productive popular readers may be, they cannot make any meanings out of a text, nor will they choose to read any text thrust before them.” (Fiske 137)

POPULAR PRODUCTIVITY

“If we conceptualize popular culture not as the consumption of images, but as a productive process, then our theoretical focus and analytical object shifts from representation to semiotic activity, from textual and narrative structures to reading practices.” (Fiske 142)

“Textual and ideological analysis presumes the disciplined, respectful bourgeois reader, who reads the whole text with equal attentiveness throughout.  The undisciplined popular reader, however, approaches the text quite differently: popular reading is often selective and spasmodic.” (Fiske 143)

FANS AND PRODUCTIVITY

MODES OF CONSUMPTION

just as context-specific as readings

children’s TV watching practices


CHAPTER 7: POLITICS

POPULISM AND THE LEFT

the political potential of popular culture; produced and enjoyed under conditions of subordination; implicated in the play of power in society

popular culture most effective in the progressive and the micropolitical

Laclau: democratic populism (liberal-pluralist); popular (progressive); populist (radical)

popular culture as popular and progressive, not populist and revolutionary

political potential of popular culture may or may not be mobilized; may or may not be progressive

THE POPULAR, PLURALISM, AND THE FOLK

popular culture never works towards liberal-pluralisst consensus; it is “the culture of the subordinate who resent their subordination” (Fiske 169)

popular culture cannot be explained by using folk models, though there are parallels; folk as stable, relatively non-conflictual order; folk as non-industrialized, non-contradictory

popular culture is not mass culture;  “There is no mass culture, there are only alarmist and pessimistic theories of mass culture that, at their best, can shed light only on the industrial and ideological imperatives of the power-bloc” (Fiske 177)

PROGRESSIVE SKEPTICISM

focus on moments where hegemony fails

PRODUCING RELEVANCE

“The mass media do not deliver ready-made popular culture as the mailman delivers mail.  Seeing the mass media as the purveyors of cultural commodities and the people as mere consumers of those commodities leads to the fallacious belief that changing the commodities will change popular culture, which will, in turn, change the social order.  Neither culture nor politics is that simple.” (Fiske 186)

POPULAR CULTURE AND SOCIAL CHANGE
