Walker, Jill. “Feral Hypertext: When Hypertext Literature Escapes Control.” ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia (2005): 46-53.


"In the last decade there has been an increasing interest in the domestication of technology, that is, in how technology has become an integral part of our daily lives.  One of the assumptions in this research is that computers and other technology need to be 'tamed' and made approachable and safe as part of the process of entering our homes and becoming part of our everyday lives" (Walker 46)

"Domestication is the process of taming and repurposing something to be useful in ways it was not developed or evolved for" (Walker 46)

"Hypertext, on the other hand, was always intended to be a tool for individuals" (Walker 46)

"In the nineties, the advent of the web and the rapid spread of personal computers and internet connections in ordinary homes radically changed the ecosystem hypertext existed in.  Hypertext, lovingly bred in captivity, was unleashed into the World Wide Web.  Suddenly, anyone could publish a website and link and be linked at will. // The result? Hypertext went feral" (Walker 47)
 
"What feral hypertexts have in common is that they have reverted to the wild, in one respect or another.  They are no longer tame.  They won't do what we expect and they refuse to stay put within boundaries we've defined.  They don't follow standards -- indeed, they appear to revel in the non-standard, while perhaps building new kinds of standard that we don't yet understand" (Walker 47)

"The online version of the Encyclopedia Britannica is an example of a domesticated and carefully controlled hypertext, while the Wikipedia is an example of a feral hypertext" (Walker 47)

"The desire for discipline is evident in calls for systematically typed links, standardised metadata and a well-coordinated semantic web.  Yet as sensible as these systems are, the web remains messy and unplanned.  There are too many creators out there, and few bother to add metadata or follow standards.  Even those who know the importance of metadata may fail to categorise their data in fear of failing to apply the taxonomy correctly.  In addition, metadata is easily abused.  Spammers have made metadata close to meaningless by adding irrelevant tags to their porn and gambling sites" (Walker 48)

"Nelson's idea of *authored* hypermedia was concurrent with an increasing trend in literary theory toward discounting the author, instead emphasising the potentially infinite associative connections between texts.  Julia Kristeva introduced the concept of intertextuality in 1967, just two years after Nelson coined the term hypertext" (Walker 48)

"What I would like to emphasise here is that the concept of intertextuality and much other late twentieth century critical theory expresses an idea of texts as *unruly* and fundamentally beyond discipline.  Much hypertext research, on the other hand, attempts to find ways to discipline and tame our thoughts, at the same time as it admits that our mind works associatively and that there are multiple ways of viewing connections in texts" (Walker 48)

"Hoaxes, spams and scams abound on the internet, and often the reason that people get so upset by these cases is precisely that the author function has begun to slip" (Walker 48) -- connects to Foucault's sense that "our idea of authorship is the only thing that keeps fiction from enveloping our world" (Walker 48); the "cancerous and dangerous proliferation of significations" (Foucault)

on collaborative authorship:  "This is where hypertext began to go feral.  When readers can alter the text, the links and the structure of the text, the link begins to run wild" (Walker 50)

"While literary hypertext presumably might go feral in many different ways, weblogs provide the clearest example of truly feral, literary hypertexts today" (Walker 51)

"In thinking thus, though, I am in a sense already trapped by an idea that boundaries are necessary.  If I cannot control the hypertext that extends between weblogs by finding a clear object that I can point to and say look, that's the work, that's the literature, as I can point to Joyce's *afternoon*, then I try to find other ways of controlling the hypertext by limiting it by author or character.  How might we think about feral hypertexts without resorting to these feeble attempts to control them?" (Walker 51-52)
