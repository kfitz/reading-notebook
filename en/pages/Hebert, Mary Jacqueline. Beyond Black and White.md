Hebert, Mary Jacqueline.  "Beyond Black and White:  The Civil Rights Movement in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 1945-1972."  Unpubl. diss., Louisiana State University, 1999.


Abstract:

stages:  movement founded in 1945 by returning WWII vets; 1953, bus boycott; suits for integration of schools and equalization of teacher salaries; 1960s sit-ins and marches by black college students; late 1960s, turn to Black Power and racial separatism

"Each stage of the movement frightened the city's white leaders.  Although they supported segregation, white leaders realized that civil rights demonstrations threatened industrial development in their community.  To preserve the stability they felt essential to continued economic expansion, they attempted to appease the activists by meeting with traditional black leaders -- racial diplomats -- and making small changes to the system of segregation.  The compromises delayed integration and angered the activists." (Hebert vi)

most white BR residents supported delaying tactics

"In 1972, the black activists' pent up anger and the slow pace of change erupted in deadly clashes with the police." (Hebert vii)

Introduction:

history of Baton Rouge, incl. dominance of Standard Oil over local economy from 1909 on ("in 1940, [SO] employed one-third of the metropolitan area's population" [Hebert 2])

throughout the middle of the twentieth century, African Americans were approximately 35 percent of the population of BR

consolidation of city and parish governments around 1945

African-American businesses; Negro Chamber of Commerce; black churches and social organizations

largest and most prominent black church, Mount Zion Baptist, "played a key role in the early years of the civil rights movement" (Hebert 6)

effects of Jim Crow in BR:  whites-only department store cafeterias and lunch counters; "African Americans also suffered wage and job discrimiation.  Although the plants and refineries hired black workers, these facilities relegated African Americans to low-paying menial and unskilled positions.  The East Baton Rouge Parish School Board also paid its black teachers a fraction of what it paid white ones" (Hebert 7)

school disparities:  17 elementary, 3 junior high, and 2 high schools for 7,700 white children; only 7 elementary and 2 high schools for 5,000 black children; white classes had maxiumum size of 35, while black classes ranged from 51 to 73; white schools were all brick, all had auditoriums, 6 had labs, 5 had cafeterias, highs had gyms; all but four black schools were wood-frame, only one had an auditorium and lab, and none had cafeteria or gym

"In 1940, only 144 black Baton Rougeans could vote" (Hebert 8)

1953 bus boycott:  "The protest lasted for nine days and ended with a compromise that maintained separation of the races on the city's buses by reserving two seats for whites and two for blacks.  The deal allowed the rest of the seats to be filled on a first come, first served basis.  Of course, the agreement stipulated that African Americans could not sit with or in front of white passengers.  This agreement maintained segregated seating to continue until 1963 when a federal course order formally banned the practice" (Hebert 9)

"When the civil rights movement began in the mid 1940s, white businessmen and politicians turned to the African Americans with whom they had had long associations for help in ending the demonstrations and ignored the black 'agitators' who were challenging the status quo.  White leaders believed that the activists represented a small portion of the population and were convinced that the members of the black leadership represented the entire African-American population.  In reality, African-American leaders occupied a tenuous position in the black community and when their meetings with whites produced compromises that fell far short of the protestors' demands, their influence declined" (Hebert 9)

***November 1972:  students at Southern clashed with police, leaving two students dead*** [-- is this the moment of the murder?]

paternalistic relationship between white and black leaders not unique to BR; black leaders would ask for assistance from white leaders (with proper deference), whites would grant it, and saw this relationship as a sign of the health of race relations

role of "racial diplomats" in slow advances -- see Robin Kelley, _Race Rebels_; racial diplomats received certain advantages, but "could not openly criticize the status quo" (Hebert 12)

after WWII, willingness to accept small changes negotiated by racial diplomats waned, and black community turned to civil rights activist veterans

one difference:  "While the diplomats used their votes to curry favor with white leaders, the World War II activists wanted to take part in policymaking, so they ran for public office.  None won." (Hebert 13)

turn to student activists in 1960s, who used strategies of direct action and nonviolent civil disobedience

students protested with dignity (in their best clothes!), but "Although student activists garnered support from the black community, white leaders viewed the students as a threat to the city's image of racial harmony and ordered Southern University's president, Felton Clark, to expel them.  Fearing white reprisals against the university if he refused, Clark complied" (Hebert 14)

Black Power activists took forefront in late 1960s; not supported by older generations of leaders and activists

black working class activists in earlier part of 1960s; did not subscribe to passive resistance; often worked at odds with black leadership

varying levels of white commitment to Jim Crow; white business leaders embraced economic expansion and therefore desired stability, and so worked with racial diplomats to end protests quickly by granting token concessions

segregationist sentiment increased after Brown v. Board of Ed; businessman John Easterly founded the "Southern Gentlemen," a group dedicated to preserving "the southern way of life" (Hebert 17); actively sought out and denounced integrationist sentiments

BR chapter of the White Citizens' Council; District Attorney Sargent Pitcher was a charter member, who "placed black activists under surveillance, arrested them on trumped-up charges, and sought the longest possible sentences for them.  He filed motions in court to ban civil rights organizations, such as the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), from holding protests in the city" (Hebert 17)

KKK made "a brief appearance" in BR in the 1950s, but had little role in segregationists' fight

"accommodationists" -- preferred segregation, but "refused to destroy Baton Rouge's economic well-being to maintain it" (Hebert 18); were disgusted by state's "open defiance" of federal govt. during 1960 NOLA school crisis, and wanted EBRP to comply with desegregation order

white liberal groups:  American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), Council on Human Relations, Louisiana Chapter of ACLU (LCLU)

AFSC arrived in BR in 1955, working to end workforce segregation at plants; when this failed, turned to school desegregation; left BR in mid 1960s to focus on Vietnam

CHR picked up where AFSC left off; focused on desegregation of public facilities, including sit-ins in local restaurants

LCLU was active in school desegregation fight, but focused on combating police brutality

white leaders and segregationists accused liberals of being outside agitators; all three organizations placed under surveillance

"In 1955, a group of [white segregationists] shot out the windows of the AFSC's office, and in 1960, they tapped the phones of several prominent liberals" (Hebert 20)

suggestion by another scholar that the pattern of protest, compromise, and delayed resolution that resulted in violence grew out of white leaders' "politics of moderation" and their "commitment to the principle of civility" -- but Hebert asks why white leaders maintained "the politics of moderation in the face of rabid segregationist attacks?  Why did they meet with black leaders to hammer out compromises?  Where did their commitment to maintaining peaceful race relations come from?" (Hebert 24)

Chapter 1:  The Civil Rights Movement in the 1940s

"white leaders in Baton Rouge knew that racial unrest was bad for business and committed themselves to preserving order and stability" (Hebert 26) -- industrial base required financial investment from outside the south

whites first responded to black demands with "delay and diplomacy" (Hebert 26), and then turned to compromises with black leaders

"While [the racial diplomats] too wanted equality and an end to segregation, they believed that these goals could only be obtained by working with white leaders and not fighting them in court or holding demonstrations.  Their policy of conciliation angered the veterans and led to divisions within the black community that grew as the civil rights movement progressed" (Hebert 27).

early 1940s: black leaders saw need for a block elementary school in neighborhood where black plant workers lived; obtained money from Julius Rosenwald Fund, got school built, and "turned it over to the School Board to staff and administer.  The board, over the protests of black parents, promptly assigned white children to the school and renamed it Gilmer Wright, after one of its deceased members.  The racial diplomats who raised the money to construct the school knew that challenging the board on this issue would complicate their future dealings with whites, so they remained silent" (Hebert 31).

incident nonetheless "revealed the disregard that many white Baton Rougeans had for the city's black citizens and hinted at the racial tension that the city's economic prosperity masked" (Hebert 31)

violence erupted in 1941; police responding to call about a fight beat and arrested several black men; black leaders circulated petition denouncing police brutality; "Facing racial unrest, white leaders convened a grand jury to investigate police brutality.  Over two hundred African Americans attended the hearing, and many testified to the brutality of the Baton Rouge police force and the sheriff's department.... Immediately following the incident, the state's leading African-American newspaper, the _Louisiana Weekly_ reported, 'This is the first time Negroes of Baton Rouge have been so aroused.  They indignantly requested that the Attorney General investigate the reported police brutality and unwarranted arrests' and even threatened to send a petition to the federal government.  In the end, the grand jury found that the police acted properly in using force in the arrests at Ideal Drug Store and that they had not used excessive force in other encounters with African Americans" (Hebert 32-33)

other attacks by whites on BR blacks, "with bus drivers being the worst offenders" (Hebert 33); "In March 1944, a bus driver shot a black passenger for being insubordinate" (Hebert 33).

examples of WWII veterans who grew up defying racism in small ways, faced racism as soldiers, and returned to BR to protest:  Dupuy Anderson, Johnnie Jones

Jones worked as dishwasher at white-owned BR restaurant "but refused to take part in the degrading tipping practice perpetuated by white customers.  They would announce that they were tipping and invite any black kitchen help -- the waiters were all white -- who wanted a tip to step outside.  The white patrons would then flip coins into the air and require that black workers catch them in their mouths" (Hebert 40).

Jones organized college chapter of NAACP at Southern after WWII

Jones's experience of police brutality led to complaint and lawsuit filed by NAACP and NOLA civil rights attorney Alexander Pierre Tureaud; superintendant of state police promised to fire the trooper involved, and Tureaud was persuaded to drop the suit; Jones "did so reluctantly.  'Those guys hadn't gone to war.  They hadn't fought over at the Normandy Invasion,' Jones recalled.  'They didn't have that same feeling [as those of us who did].  They were all good people and good friends of mine, and I respected [them].  But,... times was [sic] changing.'  He added that the racial diplomats belonged to a different generation, one that believed demonstrating and demanding change was too militant" (Hebert 42, insertions in original)

1943: legal battle to equalize the salaries of black and white teachings in EBRP; suit handled by A.P. Tureaud, but died because of fears of job loss among complainant teachers; white teachers feared equalization would come at their expense, so they lobbied for a new plan for determining salaries based on qualifications, experience, and ability

new suit filed 1946; white leaders used delaying tactics to prevent case moving forward: "H. Payne Breazeale and Victor Sachse, two of Baton Rouge's most powerful attorneys, represented the board and filed petition after petition to secure continuances" (Hebert 49); also used "divide-and-conquer" methods, offering to raise black teacher salaries by 20% if the suit was dropped; settlement negotiated, but school board didn't follow through on promises

in 1948, teachers asked Tureaud to revive the case; school board once again promised to equalize salaries if suit was dropped; several court rulings had already ordered equalization in other parishes, so the state Dept. of Ed. had ordered equalization and the legislature had allocated money for it, so school board voted for equalization

experience reinforced WWII activists' belief that blacks needed to be a part of the political process to make change, but in 1940, only 144 blacks were registered to vote, and those who were registered were given no choice of party; registrar automatically made them Republicans, so they couldn't vote in the primary

"Even after the April 1944 Supreme Court ruling in *Smith* [which declared Texas's white primary unconstitutional], East Baton Rouge Parish Registrar of Voters Jodie Smith ignored the ruling and refused to allow African Americans to register as Democrats.  Until someone complained or threatened to sue, Smith and other white leaders in Baton Rouge saw no reason to change their policy.  THe chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Committee, Fred Odom, spoke for white Baton Rouge when he noted that a ruling against Texas's white Democratic primary did not affect the Louisiana primary system.  'Even if it does apply,' he added, 'I doubt that it will change the set up in Louisiana until, or unless, the colored Democrats are invited to participate in party primaries by white Democrats.'" (Hebert 53-54)

1942: NAACP sets up voter registration committee, but not to encourage registrations; instead to "call the attention of their 'liberal-minded white friends' to the problem of black disenfranchisement" (Hebert 54); didn't work

WWII vets returned home demanding to vote, and to vote Democratic; white leaders made process difficult and demeaning, but unlike in Mississippi, never used violence or threats to prevent registrations

WWII vets set up voter registration schools

"In the late 1940s, Smith began allowing greater numbers of African Americans to register as Democrats.  Although the reasons for his change in attitude remain unclear, in all probability, white leaders trusted in their relationships with racial diplomats and believed that they could control their ballots and, through the diplomats, the ballots of the black community" (Hebert 58)

by 1952. nearly 6000 blacks were registered tovote in EBR -- but still only 10% of population

BR's activist African-American newspaper, the Weekly Leader

1952: two African Americans announce candidacy for election to school board; one immediately dropped out, but Carrie Taylor ran and received 1815 votes in primary

"the issue of race played no role in either the campaigns or in the outcome of the election.  Race baiting in Baton Rouge did not begin until after the Supreme Court's 1954 _Brown v. Board of Education_ decision" (Hebert 60)

fight to desegregate the graduate and professional schools at LSU

"After conducting a study, the committee decided not to sue for admission to LSU but instead to ask the state to pay the tuition of black students who went to graduate schools in other states, a practice that other southern states also adopted in the 1940s.  Josh Gibson, head of the board of education, fearing that African Americans would attempt to desegregate LSU if other arrangements were not made, approved the plan and asked the legislature to appropriate $100,000 to pay for the program.  The bill breezed through both houses only to have GOvernor Jimmie Davis veto it.  As a result, in August 1944, Kermit Parker, an African-American pharmacist from New Orleans, applied to LSU's Medical School.  The university rejected his application because of his race.  When the legislature met again, a bill funding out-of-state graduate study once again sailed through and this time received the governor's signature" (Hebert 61)

shenanigans at LSU Law School trying to prevent black students from suing for admission; first admitted student expelled due to character issues; first successfully admitted black students were Robert Collins and Ernest Morial

first black LSU grad student, summer 1951, Lutrill Payne ("LSU Graduate School Ordered to Admit Negro Applicant," Morning Advocate, June 13, 1951, p. 1; "Negro Enters Graduate School," Daily Reveille, June 14, 1951, p. 1)

black students lived in same dorms as white students, but there were incidents on campus revolving around the early black grad students:  "two cross-burnings: one near-riot at a football game; rocks thrown through the window of a black married couple's campus apartment; and a shooting that injured two black graduate students outside of their dormitory" (Hebert 71)

conflict over segregated American Legion parade; activist Reed called in new pastor, Reverend Theodore Judson Jemison (Mount Zion Baptist Church; born 1919 in Selma, AL); Jemison wanted to support the activists but also wanted to have a position that required him to be a racial diplomat

"While Jemison's stand on the parade seemed to challenge white authority, it actually followed the city's traditional pattern of race relations.  Initially, Jemison used conciliatory language when dealing with the whites at the meeting.  He assured them that he did not want to challenge the system of segregation.  Only when whites refused to negotiate a compromise on the parade's line-up did he decide that the black participants should pull out of the parade." (Hebert 73-74)

Chapter 2:  The Bus Boycott, 1953

city-parish council votes to raise bus fares, which angers black passengers, who make up 80 percent of ridership but are often forced to stand on buses while the first ten seats, reserved for whites, remain empty

black community appeals to racial diplomats, who request hearing from white leaders; white leaders approve compromise, which does away with reserved seating but preserves segregation (filling bus from back or front)

new law sets off series of protests in June 1953 -- bus drivers' strike, boycott of public transportation

"The boycott, which initially united Baton Rouge's black community, shattered the fragile coalition that existed between racial diplomats and World War II activists and perpetuated the pattern of protest, compromise, and anger that characterized the city's civil rights movmement" (Hebert 75).

fight begins Feb. 11, 1953, as T. J. Jemison denounces fare increase at city-parish council meeting, and asks council to allow blacks to take seats on empty buses

Feb. 25, council votes to amend seating restrictions "to allow African Americans to sit in the front seats of the buses if they did not occupy the same seat as or sit in front of a white passenger.  It abolished reserved seating but required African Americans to board the buses from back to front and white passengers from front to back.  The races with the majority of riders determined where the line of segregation began.  The proposed ordinance would also allow bus drivers to order black or white riders to sit in their own sections when seats became available." (Hebert 76)  Ordinance 222 set to go into effect Mar. 19.
