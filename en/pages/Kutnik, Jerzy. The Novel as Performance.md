Kutnik, Jerzy.  The Novel as Performance:  The Fiction of Ronald Sukenick and Raymond Federman.  Carbondale:  Southern Illinois University Press, 1986.


Foreword (by Larry McCaffery)

“performance art engages the artist and the audience in a process whose function is fundamentally different from the great mimetic tradition that Erich Auerbach identifies as the central tradition of Western art; that is, rather than aiming at representing some preexisting state of affairs, performance art seeks to be an experience for its own sake, an experience which is ultimately to be recognized as continuous with reality and not merely an occasion for interpretation and analysis” (McCaffery xiii)

performance art highlights process; analogous to process of composing daily reality


Introduction

modernism/avant-garde shook up Platonic and Aristotelian assumptions of art-as-aesthetics for the first time

further radical restructuring of aesthetics post-WWII undermined credibility of mimetic art:  most notably, “theatricalization” — “by which certain characteristics of theatrical performance were transplanted into the conventionally defined plastic arts and a number of new, hybrid genres were invented which relied almost exclusively on performance” (Kutnick xxiii)

“for the postmodern artist, performance was shown to be an essential element of all creative activity” (Kutnick xxiv)

performance is of course not new; what is new is “the awareness that all art is always performatory, that it not so much says something about reality but, by its occurrence and presence, does something as a reality in its own right.” (Kutnick xxiv)

Michel Benamou and Charles Caramello, Performance in Postmodern Culture

see also Rothenberg, Palmer, Turner, Hassan

“the present study will attempt to demonstrate the usefulness of the performance metaphor in the study of the contemporary novel...” (Kutnick xxvi)

repudiation of mimeticism

“The intention is to insure that the term ‘performance’ is not used in a loosely metaphorical sense, with reference to unrelated or isolated phenomena, but that it functions as a clearly defined critical tool capable of bringing out all the associations that make performance fully commensurate with postmodern culture.” (Kutnick xxvii)


1.  Aspects of Performance

performance as “vaguely defined aesthetic category” (Kutnick 1)

performance considered to apply only to traditional performing arts, and there even considered “derivative, a form of mediation” Kutnick (1)

%% Note:  is this the shift in DeLillo:  from considering performance as a layer of artifice that mediates between the subject and the real, to a treatment of performance as crucial to the subject, which is inevitably interpellated performatively, and can thus use performance to escape ideological strictures?

deprecation of performance manifested in reference to performance as “interpretation”:  “a good way of stressing its secondary function — an interpretation of something is not that something but follows it in time and value” (Kutnick 2)

“the heart of the problem — the fundamental irreconcilability between the classic theory of art as mimesis and the performatory theory of art implicit in the works of an increasing number of twentieth-century artists” (Kutnick 3)

distinction to be drawn between static representation and dynamic presentation

one exception to the mimetic assumption:  music

%% Note:  is this irreconcilability of representation and presentation, of mimesis and performance, to be compared to the split in Butler between the linguistic performative and the theatrical performance?

how the performatory mode came to dominate American post-war arts, w/ two particularly American contributions:  action painting and happenings

see Pollock:  painting as “a trace of the painter’s presence” telling “the story of its own happening” (Kutnick 5)

“Nonreferentiality in turn means that a painting has ‘a life of its own’ and needs no authority outside of itself to justify and evaluate its existence.” (Kutnick 6)

theatricalization of painting has little to do w/ traditional notion of performance as interpretation of creative artist’s will

happenings as painters’ theater

“the introduction of performance into the plastic, nonperforming arts did not mean merely adding an ingredient which had previously been absent, or at least suppressed, in those arts.  Not only were the boundaries between the various arts and art forms effectively blurred or even abolished completely, but the distinctions between the creative artist, the work of art, the performer, and the audience — and ultimately the distinction between art and life, too — became quite problematic as the work of art was made part of experience and the environment.” (Kutnick 12)

introduction of similar ideas into traditional performing arts radically altered the nature of performance:  John Cage, Merce Cunningham

Artaud’s anti-theater — abandoned mimesis; attempted to close gap between art and life

experimental theater abandoned representation for presentation; also added a “new” element:  ritual

Schechner:  “The play and mise-en-scene have a quality of having-been-lived, while the performance has the quality of living-now.” (qtd on Kutnick 19)

drive toward performance inseparable from Sontag’s “flight from interpretation”

application of performatory model to literature is problematic:  “within the framework of classic aesthetics, the notion of nonmimetic literature is a contradiction in terms, for according to the traditional view, literature is necessarily mimetic or representational.” (Kutnick 20) — based on philosophical assumption that language is inherently representational

%% Note:  here is the tie to Austin:  when language is shown to be other than representational, when language itself becomes performative, so, inevitably, does literature

“language is seen as merely a tool with which people subordinate and win control of the world, an instrument of communication and scientific notation” (Kutnick 21)

Wittgenstein:  precursor of postmodern theories of language — language not reflective of experience but rather in control of experience (“The limits of my language are the limits of my world.”)

self-referentiality of formal systems like language

“Formally speaking, every work of literature, indeed every utterance, states a more or less complex ‘number theory’ in general language, and so it may also reach a level at which the statement and the fact stated will become one and the same thing.  In such a situation, the work will no longer be about reality but will become itself a self-contained reality.” (Kutnick 22)

in recognizing language as potentially autonomous (not simply stating but being facts), literary works are freed from representational or mimetic obligations — predominantly visible in poetry (Rimbaud, Pound, Olson, O’Hara)

%% Note:  What Butler misses is the conjunction within the literary performance of the linguistic or discursive performative and the theatrical — point of overlap is the desire for escape from mimeticism in the literary; the breaking of the tie between language and representation

“The consolidation in the nineteenth century, both in Europe and in America, of what we call the realistic novel, or mimetic art in general, was a triumph in art of modern man’s demand for objectivity, or objective verifiability.” (Kutnick 34)

“However, the second half of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth century brought about new perceptions which could not be reconciled with the rationalistic view of the world underlying fictional realism.” (Kutnick 34)

“Under the philosophical pressures of Nietzschean irrationalism, phenomenology, and existentialism, the concept of a single, objective reality gave way to a new vision which acknowledged the existence of an infinite number of ‘realities’ individually perceived by each person.” (Kutnick 35)

modernist novel’s attempts to deal with fracturing of reality:  use of myth as structuring device, self-consciousness in fiction

“While the realists regarded language as a transparent medium, the modernists realized that the mediation of language in the communication of one’s experience to others could not be ignored.” (Kutnick 36)

equation of fiction and reality, not through perfect mimesis but through perception of construction

language itself becomes subject of novel

%% Note:  hence self-reflexivity and metafiction — as the novel becomes performance it becomes about its own gears and girders

loss of faith in fixity of reality leads to decentering of narrative voice and authorial self; question of interpretation of novel (what does it mean?) turns to structure (how is it made?)

Richard Poirier in The Performing Self:  “Literary works only provisionally constitute what Marcuse calls ‘another dimension of reality.’  They should be construed more properly as merely another dimension of action, of performance with language as its medium.” (Poirier 69; qtd on Kutnick 37)

Ihab Hassan, The Right Promethean Fire:  “I long for a concept of literature that is also explosive:  outward into gesture and performance, outward into action, responsive to change.” (Hassan 56; qtd on Kutnick 38)

Poirier’s notion of performance in inseparable from self-reflexivity

James Mellard, The Exploded Form:  distinction between game-oriented writers and play-oriented writers; game has author-directed goal, while play is performance

Mellard connects contrast between representational and performative to split between Aristotelian and Platonic aesthetics

also connects it to the distinction between the Coleridgean recreation of object by subject and the Wordsworthian creation of subject through object

Charles Caramello, Silverless Mirrors:  consideration of the “transformation of the book into Text and the attendant transformation of authorial self as shaping presence into textual self as shaped presence” (Caramello 3; qtd on Kutnick 44-45)

“As a precondition for experiencing ‘the pleasure of the text’ (‘bliss’), Barthes emphasizes the necessity of collapsing the modern subject/object dichotomy by conceiving of the text as a performing space, a stage where the writer and the reader join in the composition of the book as, to use Caramello’s words, a ‘multimedia artifact.’  Barthes says, ‘On the stage of the text, no footlights; there is not, behind the text, someone active (the writer) and out front someone passive (the reader); there is not a subject and an object’.” (Barthes, The Pleasure of the Text 66; Kutnik 46)


Conclusion:  The Fiction Writer on Stage

“those features of artistic performance which are shared by most postmodern art and literature” (Kutnick 228); two groups:  those that stress nonmimeticism (abstractness, self-referentiality, etc.) and those that stress dynamism (motion, process, etc.)

“a work of art can be an open-form event or process in which the medium of a given art form is employed not for the sake of transmitting some prearranged meaning but in order to produce a meaning which could not otherwise be generated and experienced.” (Kutnick 229)

audience becomes collaborators in creative process

new role for critic as well: move away from evaluation and toward description; interpretation becomes less about mining pre-existing meaning than about participating in the work of art

developments in science, philosophy, and social thought also center around performance in collapsing distinctions between subject and object and other dualities:  quantum physics, role theory of personal identity, Heisenberg, Austinian performative;  “All this seems enough to justify adopting performance as a metaphor for the dominant mode of much of contemporary art and of postmodern thought and activity in general as well.” (Kutnick 232)
