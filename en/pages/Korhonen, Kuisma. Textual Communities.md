Korhonen, Kuisma. “Textual Communities: Nancy, Blanchot, Derrida.” Culture Machine 8 (2006): n. pag. Web. 30 Nov. 2010.


"The notions of 'textual community,' 'literary community,' or 'community of readers' are traditionally used as a way to stress the role of specific contexts in literature."

"literature is thus seen as a social activity of a certain spatially and temporally determined group of authors, readers, translators, editors, publishers, booksellers, critics, students, and other members of a literary community."

"Literary education has always been a privilege of the few, and the majority of humankind today is still deprived of the actual possibilities of participating in literary communities."

"Western civilizations have for a long time justified their political supremacy by their cultural heritage, and the canonized literary works have been read as founding texts of national identity..."

"Literature creates all kinds of communities, every day."

"Textual encounters do not only create communities but challenge them, make them unstable, and unpredictable.  This may sometimes lead to the collapse of former institutions and to the birth of new interpretive communities, sects, and institutionalized identities.  The unstable character of institutionalized textual communities can be seen as an indicator revealing the existence of an invisible textual community, perhaps the most radical community of all: those who do not know each other, who are not reading for any clearly determined purpose, who open themselves to the otherness of literary texts beyond all socially shared conventions of reading and interpretation.  There is another community beneath the visible institutionalized communities, a community of solitary readers."

"Texts are promiscuous, even though we perhaps do not like the idea that literally *everyone* reads them (we perhaps still want to think that communities have an outside)."

"It seems that in order to think communities of solitary readers we need a new concept of community that is not based on the ideas of a shared time, space, or identity."

"Can we form a community, for example a community of readers, which would not identify itself as antagonistic to other communities?" -- see Darryl on the factions that arose in the Infinite Summer community

"the conviction, shared more or less by all the authors mentioned above but expressed perhaps most memorably by Levinas, that human subjects come into being only in relation to the Other."

Blanchot: "Community is 'loneliness that is experienced together'"

"in /La communauté affrontée/ Nancy explains that in his later works he has preferred the expressions 'being-together,' 'being-in-common,' or 'being-with' to 'community'. He points to the dangers of using the word 'community' 'its religious and ethnic use (or misuse), and suggests that 'with' is 'just the sharing and sharing out of space, at most a contact: a being-together without assemblage"

"Is there, in a literary community, something that avoids the pitfalls of immanent, working communities? Can we recognize in textual community something like the 'unavowable community'?" -- in other words, are reading groups (even online) destined to become working communities, with the potential for exclusions and violence toward the other?

"There are many good (and many not so good) reasons to read and to participate in actual working communities of readers: we may gain cultural capital, we may develop our emotional skills, we may learn more about other cultures, we may satisfy our curiosity, we may enjoy voyeurism, we may just want to kill time, etc.  (Or, as professionals of literature, we may gain money.) But for the most part, these 'reasons' imply that there is some other, more fundamental desire for reading, desire that cannot be pinpointed or defined exactly, except perhaps by this loose and note really very clear definition: we read because we are not self-sufficient creatures, because we acknowledge (perhaps unconsciously) the imperative of the Other, the necessity to stay open to the call of otherness."

"the crucial role of openness to otherness in reading... Without this openness, there cannot be any reading at all."

"in every textual encounter, the other in the text is in some way transformed from a sheer object or machine to something that carries marks of subjectivity" -- perhaps especially true of some kinds of textual encounters that take place in networked communities

"In a textual encounter, the reader feels that she is no longer only reading a text, but, in a curious and paradoxical way, the text is also reading him or her."

"In reading, we are both active and passive: we use texts for our own desires and purposes, but we also, in a way, encounter texts, almost as we encounter other human beings, taking the risk that the encounter may change us in a way that we cannot totally know or control beforehand."

"In the experience of reading, the reader ceases to be only an immanent and autonomous subject; instead, reading demands a level of passivity where the reader takes responsibility for the other, exists, as Levinas puts it, as 'one-for-the-other'." -- see Infinitedetox and submitting to the text

"The community that Blanchot refers to as 'ideal community of literary communication' was therefore not a self-conscious organization, but rather a changing network of friends who gathered, every now and then, around a table, everyone with different motives, not necessarily recognizing the full significance of the moment, and not making any lasting commitments"

"As writers, we join the dead. As soon as we have written our words down, they cease to be ours, they become words of someone who is no longer here, who has already crossed the line and moved to the other side."

"Part of the author's responsibility is to answer also for those who did not write, who did not leave documents or other official traces; who, in the maelstroms of history, were marginalized, silenced or killed."

"no community can ever fulfil the visions of communication and recognition that the notion of community opens up to us. Every community betrays us, although by betraying us it may also bring us new encounters that we neer even dreamed about."

"We cannot escape communities.  We need working communities, we need new ways of being-together, new institutions that offer frameworks for our labour.  The negative, unworking, or unavowable community is not an alternative that could replace working communities."

"Literature cannot exist without those social structures that enable the development of literary circles and production of books.  But beneath those working communities is always another community - a textual counter-community that includes not only silent, solitary readers, but voices of the dead, the absent and the non-existent." -- what I want to note here is the ways in which new networked modes of communication facilitate the disruption of some of those social structures, replacing them with opportunities for encounter: self- and independent publishing, for instance

"I am alone in a room, reading Derrida.  And I am not alone -- I can never truly be alone when reading, I always carry the voices of others within me, and the text I read carries the voices of others in it."

footnote 7, referring to Levinasian substitution:  "A more common way to proceed here would be to talk about *identification*.  However, identification not only refers to a kind of chiasmatic exchange of positions between the subject and its other (for example, between the reader and the character), but also to a process where the subject appropriates the identity of the other and constructs his or her own identity through this appropriation.  This may, indeed, take place in reading, and we do not need to see this as a childish or naive act."
