Introduction

"the postmodern as an attempt to think the present historically in an age that has forgotten how to think historically in the first place." (Jameson ix)

postmodern looks for breaks, where modern looked for flow of change

postmodern more formal than modernism: clocks changes, considering content mere images

"Postmodernism is what you have when the modernization process is complete and nature is gone for good." (Jameson ix) -- culture as a "second nature"

immense dilation of sphere of culture (cultural commodities); "the aestheticization of reality" (Jameson x)

"modernism was still minimally and tendentially the critique of the commodity . . . Postmodernism is the consumption of sheer commodification as a process." (Jameson x)

"lifestyle":"fetishism"\::animism:advanced monotheism; "any sophisticated theory of the postmodern ought to bear something of the same relationship to Horkheimer and Adorno's old 'Culture Industry' concept as MTV or fractal ads bear to fifties television series." (Jameson x)

postmodernism theory: pm as the disappearance of modernism history (Jameson) or the end of "master narratives" (Lyotard)?

the way in which any observation about pm can be turned into theory; pm as the theory of itself

four themes: interpretation, Utopia, survivals of the modern, "returns of the repressed"

late capitalism: use originated with Frankfurt School; "(1) a tendential web of bureaucratic control . . . and (2) the interpenetration of government and big business" (Jameson xviii)

Jameson's late capitalism:  transnational business, international division of labor, international banking (w/ huge debt), computers and automation, media interrelationship, etc.

late capitalism becomes totally pervasive, absorbs culture; collapse of distinction between base and superstructure; collapse of distinction between "cultural" and "economic"

Chapter 1 -- Culture: The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism

one fundamental feature of all postmodernisms: "the effacement in them of the older (essentially high-modernist) frontier between high culture and so-called mass or commercial culture, and the emergence of new kinds of texts infused with the forms, categories, and contents of that very culture industry so passionately denounced by all the ideologues of the modern, from Leavis and the American New Criticism all the way to Adorno and the Frankfurt School." (Jameson 2)

Ernest Mandel: third stage or moment in the evolution of capital

"every position on postmodernism in culture . . . is also at one and the same time, and necessarily, an implicitly or explicitly political stance on the nature of multinational capitalism today" (Jameson 3)

postmodernism not as style, but as cultural dominant

constitutive features of postmodernism: (1) a new depthlessness; (2) a consequent weakening of historicity, both in public History and (3) private temporality; (4) a new emotional groundtone of "intensities" and a deep constitutive relationship to a whole new technology; (5) postmodern mutations in the lived experience of built space; (6) the new mission of political art

I

Van Gogh's painting of the peasant shoes; Utopian gesture in the transformation of a drab peasant object world into glorious color -- hermeneutic readings of painting (work taken as clue for some vaster reality

Warhol's Diamond Dust Shoes; no place for viewer; fetishes -- no way to complete the hermeneutic gesture and recreate larger lived context of shoes

Warhol's work turns centrally around commodification; commodity fetishism

new kind of flatness or depthlessness; superficiality in most literal sense

"the waning of affect in postmodern culture" (Jameson 10)

Warhol's human subjects as commodified objects; transformed into their own images

modernism and the age of anxiety; expression of emotion presupposing a fundamental split between inside and outside

contemporary theory works toward discrediting this inside/outside split; but contemporary theory is a postmodern phenomenon; postmodern critique of the depth model as symptomatic

repudiation of depth models:  hermeneutic one of inside/outside; dialectical one of essence/appearance; Freudian one of latent/manifest (repression); existential one of authenticity/inauthenticity (alienation/disalienation); semiotic one of signifier/signified

depth models replaced by surfaces

modernist concepts such as anxiety and alienation no longer appropriate in postmodernism

"This shift in the dynamics of cultural pathology can be characterized as one in which the alienation of the subject is displaced by the latter's fragmentation." (Jameson 14)

the death of the subject; the decentering of the formerly centered subject

the end of the bourgeois ego brings with it the end of the ego's psychopathologies, but it also brings the end of the unique personal style; "not merely a liberation from anxiety but a liberation from every other kind of feeling as well" (Jameson 15)

waning of modernist thematics of time and temporality; now inhabit the synchronic rather than the diachronic; dominated by categories of space rather than categories of time

II

pastiche, to be distinguished from parody; "Pastiche is, like parody, the imitation of a peculiar or unique, idiosyncratic style, the wearing of a linguistic mask, speech in a dead language.  But it is a neutral practics of such mimicry, without any of parody's ulterior motives, amputated of the satiric impulse, devoid of laughter and of any conviction that alongside the abnormal tongue you have momentarily borrowed, some healthy linguistic normality still exists." (Jameson 17)

random cannibalization of the past, random stylistic allusion

"the 'simulacrum,' the identical copy for which no original has ever existed" (Jameson 18)

"In faithful conformity to poststructuralist linguistic theory, the past as 'referent' finds itself gradually bracketed, and then effaced altogether, leaving us with nothing but texts." (Jameson 18)

"omnipresent, omnivorous, and well-nigh libidinal historicism" (Jameson 18) in nostalgia?

"Faced with these ultimate objects -- our social, historical, and existential present, and the past as 'referent' -- the incompatibility of a postmodernist 'nostalgia' art language with genuine historicity becomes dramatically apparent." (Jameson 19)

film remakes:  "The word remake is, however, anachronistic to the degree to which our awareness of the preexistence of other versions (previous films of the novel as well as the novel itself) is now a constitutive and essential part of the film's structure: we are now, in other words, in 'intertextuality' as a  deliberate, built-in feature of the aesthetic effect and as the operator of a new connotation of 'pastness' and pseudohistorical depth, in which the history of aesthetic style replaces 'real' history." (Jameson 20)

the historical novel (see Doctorow) can no longer represent the historical past, but only our ideas and stereotypes about that past

III

question of temporal organization

Lacan's account of schizophrenia as a breakdown in the signifying chain

meaning as not a one-to-one relationship between signifier and signified, but generated by movement from signifier to signifier; when links between signifiers snap, schizophrenia in the form of "a rubble of distinct and unrelated signifiers" (Jameson 26)

personal identity formed in temporal links between moments of past and future; such temporal unification is a function of language; breakdown in temporality leaves series of "pure and unrelated presents in time" (27)

photorealism: "looked like a return to representation and figuration after the long hegemony of the aesthetics of abstraction until it became clear that their objects were not to be found in the 'real world' either but were themselves photographs of that real world, this last now transformed into images, of which the 'realism' of the photorealist painting is now the simulacrum." (Jameson 30)

"The former work of art, in other words, has now turned out to be a text, whose reading proceeds by differentiation rather than by unification." (Jameson 31)

IV

"intensities": "how an unparalleled leap in the alienation of daily life in the city can now be experienced in the form of a strange new hallucinatory exhilaration" (Jameson 33)

the "sublime": an experience bordering on terror, the awesome glimpse of what was so enormous as to crush human life altogether; Kant includes the question of representation (incapacity of the human to give representation to the sublime)

the other of the sublime was once God or Nature; now something else: technology? ("that enormous properly human and anti-natural power of dead human labor stored up in out machinery" [Jameson 35])

technological development in the Marxist view as result of development of capital; Mandel's three stages of technological revolution: steam-driven motors; electric and combustion motors; electronic and nuclear-powered apparatuses

three corresponding stages of capitalism:  market capitalism; monopoly or imperialist capitalism; multinational capitalism

shifts in relationship to and **representation of the Machine** in each stage (compare representations of turbines, trains, to representations of computers, televisions)

machines of reproduction rather than production; representation of processes in narrative

"I want to suggest that our faulty representations of some immense communicational and computer network are themselves but a distorted figuration of something even deeper, namely, the whole world system of a present-day multinational capitalism." (Jameson 37) -- conspiracy theory as attempt to "think the impossible totality of the contemporary world system" (Jameson 38)

V

a mutation in built space; a mutation in the object for which there has been none in the subject

"populism" of postmodern architecture as compared to elitist modernism?

postmodern building as mini-city; hidden entrances reveal its desire for separation from the surrounding world; reflective glass skin as means of keeping the Other out

movements through buildings as virtual narratives; strolling movement replaced by movement of machine (elevators, escalators)

"this latest mutation in space -- postmodern hyperspace -- has finally succeeded in transcending the capacities of the individual human body to locate itself, to organize its immediate surroundings perceptually, and cognitively to map its position in a mappable external world" (Jameson 44)

symbol of our inability to map multinational capitalism/international communications network?

inability to tell the story of the first postmodern war (Vietnam) using traditional forms of war novel/movie

VI

postmodernism as cultural dominant rather than one among many styles

"the logic of the simulacrum, with its transformation of older realities into television images, does more than merely replicate the logic of late capitalism; it reinforces and intensifies it" (Jameson 46)

but if postmodernism is a historical phenomenon, moralizing judgements are a mistake

instead, dialectical thinking: "We are somehow to lift our minds to a point at which it is possible to understand that capitalism is at one and the same time the best thing that has ever happened to the human race, and the worst." (Jameson 47)

Is there a "moment of truth" inside the "moments of falsehood" of postmodernism?  Does the dialectical view not surrender us to passivity?

postmodernism as inseparable from a fundamental mutation in the sphere of culture, including a massive change in its social function

logic of late capitalism has destroyed the semi-autonomous sphere of culture -- but not an extinction; rather, an explosion: "a prodigious expansion of culture throughout the social realm, to the point at which everything in our social life -- from economic value and state power to practices and to the very structure of the psyche itself -- can be said to have become 'cultural' in some original and untheorized sense." (Jameson 48)

notions of cultural politics outdated, particularly the concept of "critical distance," in which one positions the cultural act outside of capital; opposition absorbed into system

repudiation in bourgeois art of the pedagogical and the didactic; political art must foreground?

aesthetic of new cultural form as cognitive mapping? the practical reconquest of space

Althusserian definition of ideology: "the representation of the subject's imaginary relationship to his or her real conditions of existence" -- cognitive mapping of social space

"The Althusserian formula . . . designates a gap, a rift, between existential experience and scientific knowledge.  Ideology has then the function of somehow inenting a way of articulating those two distinct dimensions with each other." (Jameson 53) -- our current crisis is that we live in a historical situation in which this is not possible

what has been omitted:  the Lacanian Symbolic

"the new political art (if it is possible at all) will have to hold to the truth of postmodernism, that is to say, to its fundamental object -- the world space of multinational capital -- at the same time at which it achieves a breakthrough to some as yet unimaginable new mode of representing this last" (Jameson 54)

Chapter 2 -- Ideology: Theories of the Postmodern

problem of postmodernism as both aesthetic and political

four general positions, each susceptible to politically progressive or reactionary expression

first two agree that some break has occurred between modernism and postmodernism:

1. pro-postmodern, anti-modern (progressive: Jencks; reactionary: Wolfe)

2. anti-postmodern, pro-modern (progressive: Habermas; reactionary: Kramer, The New Criterion)

last two repudiate the idea of such a historical break, seeing instead an intensification

3. pro-modernisms (Lyotard)

4. anti-modernisms (Tafuri)

"most of the political positions which we have found to inform which is most often conducted as an aesthetic debate are in reality moralizing ones that seek to develop final judgements on the phenomenon of postmodernism . . . The point is that we are within the culture of postmodernism to the point where its facile repudiation is as impossible as any equally facile celebration of it is complacent and corrupt." (Jameson 62)

Jencks: postmodernism distinguishes itself from modernism through its populist priorities; postmodern buildings celebrate their insertion into the American city rather than seeking to remove themselves; play of allusion and formal echoes ("historicism") reflects commercial surroundings

distinguish commercial culture (including ads, packaging, logos, etc.) from older folk culture

radical differentiation of modernist and mass culture in criticism no longer possible in postmodernism

all culture is politics, except the overtly political, which is cultural (impossibility of political art?)

postmodern political art as interminable conjecture on its own possibility?  (theory?)

"rigorously conducted, an inquiry into this or that feature of the postmodern will end up telling us little of value about postmodernism itself, but against its own will and quite unintentionally a great deal about the modern proper" (Jameson 66)

Chapter 3 -- Video: Surrealism Without the Unconscious

"Capitalism, and the modern age, is a period in which, with the extinction of the sacred and the 'spiritual,' the deep underlying materiality of all things has finally risen dripping and convulsive into the light of day . . . it is because culture has become material that we are now in a position to understand that it always was material, or materialistic, in its structures and functions." (Jameson 67)

"media" as replacing "genres" and "forms": "a word which now conjoins three relatively distinct signals: that of an artistic mode or specific form of aesthetic production; that of a specific technology, generally organized around a central apparatus or machine; and that, finally, of a social institution." (Jameson 67)

"It is because we have had to learn that culture today is a matter of media that we have finally begun to get it through our heads that culture was always that, and that the older forms or genres, or indeed the older spiritual exercises and meditations, thoughts and expressions, were also in their very different ways media products." (Jameson 68)

"the Consciousness Industry" -- his intensification of Adorno's "Culture Industry"?

film as first distinctively mediatic art form (and dominant art form of twentieth century -- though literature remained the ideologically dominant paradigm)

film nonetheless remains an essentially modernist formulation, now seemingly antiquated (film and literature now increasingly depend on" materials, forms, technology, and even thematics borrowed from the other art or medium I have in mind" [69])

video: commercial television/video art

radical differentiation of film theory and theory of video

"the blockage of fresh thinking before this solid little window against which we strike our heads being not unrelated to precisely that whole or total flow we observe through it" (Jameson 70)

obsolescence of critical distance in the face of total flow; structural exclusion of memory

witness the full rnage of possibilities of television in experimental video

boredom as an aesthetic response

film theory: "relationship between the mediation of the filmic machine and the construction of the viewer's subjectivity" (Jameson 74) -- the gaze? -- mechanical decentering of the subject goes further in video

experience of time: "fiction" = contruction of fictive temporalities which are substituted for (and enable one to forget) "real time"

video is thus non-fictive, in that it does not project fictive time; commercial television aspires to fictive time, but produces instead a simulacrum of fictive time

emergence of the machine in art "deconcealed" the materiality/social constructedness of time?

real time = objective time; measureable time only emerges with possibility of measurement; clocks appear to measure time, but do it in space

video's locus is in the seam between space and time

television punctuated by machine time: divisions of hour and half-hour, commercial breaks

interruptions of machine time allows only the production of an "imaginary" fictive time on TV

"Commercial television is not an autonomous object of study; it con only be grasped for what it is by positioning it dialectically over against that other signifying system which we have called experimental video" (Jameson 77) -- REALLY?  Why not study it in relation to radio?

most suggestive precursor: animated film -- ???

connotation/denotation in Barthes, enormously influential in media studies; assigned authenticity to the denotative value of the image, and "a guilty social or ideological functionality" (Jameson 84) to its connotative use, e.g., in advertising

in video, the degree that connotations are reducible to a binary opposition is the presence of theme

rapid play of quoted images in video, each as a logo; new form of advertising?

logo: "something like the synthesis of an advertising image and a brand name; better still, it is a brand name which has been transformed into an image" (Jameson 85)

logos in video do not exist in isolation; contant, random interaction between them; total flow

dominance of auditory over visual

alienation as modernist concept as well as modernist experience; psychic fragmentation more applicable to postmodernism

"thematic" moments in video (when message becomes apparent) interrupt the flow of images

"If interpretation is understood, in the thematic way, as the disengagement of a fundamental theme or meaning, then it seems clear that the postmodernist text -- of which we have taken the videotape in question to be a privileged exemplar -- is from that perspective defined as a structure or sign flow which resists meaning, whose fundamental inner logic is the exclusion of the emergence of themes as such in that sense, and which therefore systematically sets out to short-circuit traditional interpretive temptations" (Jameson 91-92)

"place" as "a bounded space in which something may happen" (Jameson 92)

"the deepest 'subject' of all video art, and even of all postmodernism, is very precisely reproductive technology itself." (Jameson 95)

Chapter 4 -- Architecture: Spatial Equivalents in the World System

architecture as late taste among North Americans, along with food

post-war, unfulfilled tastes diverted into instant commodification: fast food and kitsch decorating

"wrapping" of one (architectural) text inside another

architecture shows "a kind of antigravity of the postmodern utterly different in spirit from the law of falling bodies of the modern" (Jameson 101)

paradox of the postmodern: its claim to originality lies in its renunciation of the new and recycling/ repeating/quoting of the old

rewriting architecture in terms of language

"if the great negative emotions of the modernist moment were anxiety, terror, the being-unto-death, and Kurtz's 'horror,' what characterizes the newer 'intensities' of the postmodern, which have also been characterized in terms of the 'bad trip' and of schizophrenic submersion, can just as well be formulated in terms of the messiness of a dispersed existence, existential messiness, the perpetual temporal distraction of post-sixties life." (Jameson 117)

"a present reality that has been transformed into a simulacrum by the process of wrapping, or quotation, and has thereby become not historical but historicist" (Jameson 118)

"place in the United States today no longer exists, or, more precisely, it exists at a much feebler level, surcharged by all kinds of other more powerful but also more abstract spaces" (Jameson 127)

Chapter 5 -- Sentences: Reading and the Division of Labor

"pastiche, a bravura imitation so exact as to include the well-nigh undetectable reproduction of stylistic authenticity itself" (Jameson 133)

"the breakdown of description and the failure of language to  achieve some of the most obvious things it has been supposed to do" (Jameson 135)

"in the nouveau roman, reading undergoes a remarkable specialization and, very much like older handicraft activity at the onset of the industrial revolution, is dissociated into a variety of distinct processes according to the general law of the division of labor" (Jameson 140)

experience of art today alienated from most people by process of specialization (including technologies and machineries); even hobbies organized and institutionalized

"For us today, it is generally the case that what looks like realism turns out at best to offer unmediated access only to what we think about reality, to our images and ideological stereotypes about it" (Jameson 150)

Chapter 6 -- Space: Utopianism After the End of Utopia

move in postmodernism from the temporality of modernism proper to a heightened spatiality

"the widespread textualization of the outside world in contemporary thought (the body as a text, the state as a text, consumption as a text) should itself be seen as a fundamental form of postmodern spatialization" (Jameson 158)

Utopian impulses to be detected in various forms of the postmodern

end of ideologies/end of Utopia -- reactionary sentiments

"see in all these varied Utopian vision as they have emerged from the sixties the development of a whole range of properly spatial Utopias in which the transformation of social relations and political institutions is projected onto the vision of place and landscape, including the human body" (Jameson 160)

"postmodern spatialization here plays itself out in the relationship and rivalry among the various spatial media -- in the claims and formal powers of video over against film, for example, or of photography over against painting as a medium.  Indeed, we may speak of spatialization here as the process whereby the traditional fine arts are mediatized: that is, they now come to consciousness of themselves as various media within a mediatic system in which their own internal production also constitutes a symbolic message and the taking of a position on the status of the medium in question." (Jameson 162)

historicism; depthlessness

"That such Utopianism is an ideology -- including an aesthetic ideology -- seems clear enough; but at a time when we have minimally agreed that everything is ideology, or better still, that there is nothing outside of ideology, that does not seem a very damaging admission either." (Jameson 180)

Chapter 7 -- Theory: Immanence and Nominalism in Postmodern Theoretical Discourse

PART 1. IMMANENCE AND THE NEW HISTORICISM

Walter Benn Michaels's The Gold Standard and the Logic of Naturalism as exemplary (for better or for worse) of the methods of New Historicism

"Against Theory" (Michaels and Stephen Knapp): "theory" = "the tendency to generate theoretical problems by splitting apart terms that are in fact inseparable" (Jameson 182); leads to two errors:  the separation of authorial intention from the meaning of texts, and the separation of knowledge from beliefs

claim that to stop doing theory will have no consequences; what will the status of philosophy be?

"a rehearsal of the old tension between 'immanence' and 'transcendence'" (Jameson 183); New Critics worried about same problem, opting for textual immanence (formalism), using terms "intrinsic" and "extrinsic," and calling all theory/politics/history/biography extrinsic

declaration of separation from theory becomes another named theory

New Historicism as "return to history" is not the opposite of theory, but its own set of theories

New Historicism actually marked by a shared writing practice rather than shared ideology

label of New Historicism as an accusation

contemporary thought and culture as profoundly nominalist? (naming? categorizing?)

changes wrought by introduction of the concept of a "text"; textuality "seems to reorganize the objects of other disciplines and to make it possible to deal with them in new ways which suspend the troublesome notion of 'objectivity'" (Jameson 186)

New Historicism as a return to immanence and a prolongation of use of homologies while throwing out homology's theory and abandoning the notion of "structure"

Stephen Greenblatt's Renaissance Self-Fashioning as inaugural volume of New Historicism

New Historicism as "a 'montage of historical attractions' . . . in which extreme theoretical energy is captured and deployed, but repressed by a valorization of immanence and nominalism that can either look like a return to the 'thing itself' or a 'resistance to theory.'" (Jameson 190)

in Michaels, "money" has lost all its Marxist connotations; not longer coterminous w/economics

"the very revival of naturalism itself today, in full postmodernism, can be seen as something like a return of the repressed" (Jameson 197)

"the formal tendency of a system or method to complete itself and to endow itself, against its own will and vocation, with a foundation that grounds it" (Jameson 199)

polemical, protopolitical consequences drawn from homologies

Michaels imputing to "subversive" texts the vice of trying to claim a Utopian space outside the dynamics of the market; "it was always implicit in the theoreticians of the 'total system,' such as Foucault, that if the system was as tendentially totalizing as he said it was, then all local revolts, let alone 'revolutionary' impuses, remained inside that and were in reality a function of its immanent dynamic" (Jameson 203)

relationship between liberalism and radicalism; liberalism supposes the "system" is not total

"'the market' is in Michaels what is today often contemptuously described as a totalizing concept" (Jameson 211)

the corporation as "a different kind of agency -- still somehow a 'subject,' like the individual consciousness, yet now immortal, impersonal in another way, collective beyond the dreams of populism, and embodied, institutionalized in so rigorous a fashion as to give it social and historical objectivity beyond all fantasy" (Jameson 215)

"On one level of history, something has happened: the corporation and the trust have consigned individualism (and its forms and categories) to the ash can of history.  On the other level, nothing has changed and the market continues as before, as far as the eye can reach." (Jameson 217)

PART 2. DECONSTRUCTION AS NOMINALISM

"for poststructuralism, all enemies are on the left, and . . . the principal target always turns out to be this or that form of historical thinking" (Jameson 217)

synchronic v. diachronic thinking

DeMan and Rousseau

"name" -- "a use of language which isolates the particular in its strong sense of the absolutely unique and individual" (Jameson 228); begins to reveal the "perversity and impossibility" of the act of nomination

reign of the name ends where the word, concept, abstraction begins; DeMan identifies this transformation as the operation of metaphor

"All language may in that sense be 'about language,' but talking about language is finally no different from talking about anything else." (Jameson 239)

language's "unresolvable problem of denomination" (Jameson 240)

DeMan as nominalist (Jameson 250)

???

Chapter 8 -- Economics: Postmodernism and the Market

attempts to separate ideological market from practical market impossible: "the ideology of the market is unfortunately not some supplementary ideational or representational luxury or embellishment that can be removed and sent over to some cultural or superstructural morgue, to be dissected by specialists over there.  It is somehow generated by the thing itself" (Jameson 260)

relationship of ideas of freedom and equality to the market; turns out to be unfreedom/inequality

Marx as modernist, drawing on ideas of photography, suggesting that the ideological dimension is imaginary, meaning that it is real insofar as it is an image

rhetoric of the market as central component of ideological struggle (struggle for legitimation/ delegitimation of left discourse)

market as part of human nature (right) -- slogan of the market devised to secure a shift from the conceptuality of production to that of distribution and consumption

Becker: market as metaphor for all human behavior? -- production model! (reactionary)

"The Becker model is postmodern in it structure as a transcoding; two separate explanatory systems are combined here by way of the assertion of a fundamental identity" (Jameson 269-70)

passion for the market is always political

market as totalizing structure

"the most astonishing feature of this discursive development; namely, how the dreariness of business . . . should in our time have proved to be so sexy. In my opinion, the excitement of the once tiresome old fifties representation of the free market derives from its illicit metaphorical association with a very different kind of representation; namely the media itself in its largest contemporary and global sense" (Jameson 274-75)

transcoding of market and media

"the tendential identification of the commodity with its image (or brand name or logo)" (Jameson 275)

"Today the products are, as it were, diffused throughout the space and time of the entertainment (or even news) segments, as part of that content, so that in a few well-publicized cases (most notably the series Dynasty) it is sometimes not clear when the narrative segment has ended and the commercial has begun" (Jameson 275)

consumption of the process of consumption

Debord's image theory (image as final form of commodity reification)

"Many analyses have shown how the news broadcasts are structured exactly like narrative serials; meanwhile, some of us in that other precinct of an official, or 'high,' culture, have tried to show the waning and obsolesence of categories like 'fiction' (in the sense of something opposed either to the 'literal' or the 'factual')." (Jameson 277)

Chapter 9 -- Film: Nostalgia for the Present

1950s nostalgia: "The list is not a list of facts or historical realities (although its items are not invented and are in some sense 'authentic'), but rather a list of stereotypes, of ideas of facts and historical realities." (Jameson 279)

TV series as source for content of image of fifties; "If there is 'realism' in the 1950s, in other words, it is presumably to be found there, in mass cultural representation" (Jameson 280)

refusal of the period's "high art" to deal with middle-American small town life and consumption

disappearance of the small town

shift between realities of the 1950s and representations of the "fifties"; revealing the possibility that "period concepts finally correspond to no realities whatsoever" (Jameson 282)

novelistic reconstruction of 1950s America as "a collective wish-fulfillment, and the expression of a deep, unconscious yearning for a simpler and more human social system and a small-town Utopia very much in the North American frontier tradition" (Jameson 283)

questions of history and historicity; analogies between science fiction and historical novels -- dialectical and structural relationship, kinship and inversion at the same time

if historical novel corresponded to the emergence of historicity, science fiction corresponds to the waning or blockage of historicity

"Historicity is, in fact, neither a representation of the past nor a representation of the future . . . : it can first and foremost be defined as a perception of the present as history; that is, as a relationship to the present which somehow defamiliarizes it and allows us that distance from immediacy which is at length characterized as a historical perspective." (Jameson 284)

trope of the "future anterior -- the estrangement and renewal as history of our own reading present, the fifties, by way of the apprehension of that present as the past of a specific future" (Jameson 285)

reification (thingification?) incorporated into the novel as a form of praxis: "the fifties is a thing, but a thing that we can build . . . reification ceases to be a baleful and alienating process, a noxious side-effect of our mode of production, if not, indeed, its fundamental dynamic, and is rather transferred to the side of human energies and human possibilities" (Jameson 285)

fears of near future as class-based; fears of proletarianization

"Yet everything in our culture suggests that we have not, for all that, ceased to be preoccupied by history; indeed, at the very moment in which we complain, as here, of the eclipse of historicity, we also universally diagnose contemporary culture as irredeemably historicist, in the bad sense of an omnipresent and indiscriminate appetite for dead styles and fashions" (Jameson 286)

what is the difference? the structure of the two types of historicity: "the one mobilizing a vision of the future in order to determin its retur to a now historical present; the other mobilizing, but in some new allegorical way, a vision of the past, or of a certain moment of the past" (Jameson 287)

nostalgia film (see Blue Velvet and Something Wild): "it is because the formal apparatus of nostalgia films has trained us to consume the past in the form of glossy images that new and more complex 'postnostalgia' statements and forms become possible" (Jameson 287)

cross between two filmic modes: high elegance of nostalgia films, and iconoclastic B punk films

the gothic, "where -- on the individualized level -- a sheltered woman of some kind is terrorized and victimized by an 'evil' male" (Jameson 289) -- gothic as class fantasy; gothic with collective victim (US)

Something Wild as "an essentially allegorical narrative in which the 1980s meet the 1950s" (Jameson 290)

Blue Velvet as attempt to put sadomasochism on the mass-cultural map

"Thus these films can be read as dual symptoms: they show a collective unconscious in the process of trying to identify its own present at the same time that they illuminate the failure of this attempt, which seems to reduce itself to the recombination of various stereotypes of the past." Jameson (296)

Chapter 10 -- Conclusion: Secondary Elaborations

I. PROLOGOMENA TO FUTURE CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN THE MODERN AND THE POSTMODERN

"Marxism" and "postmodernism" as incompatible concepts?

taste/analysis/evaluation; Jameson's opinions of the postmodern

music in the postmodern era:  MTV as the spatialization of music

distinguishing between narrative and narrativization

comparisons of aesthetic forms of different periods as "a deeper comparison between the modes of production themselves. . . . The example of the modern/postmodern, however, shows that this also holds good for stages within a single mode of production, in this case for the confrontation between the modernist (or imperialist, or monopoly) stage of capitalism and its postmodern (or multinational) stage." (Jameson 301)

II. NOTES TOWARD A THEORY OF THE MODERN

"The 'classics' of the modern can certainly be postmodernized, or transformed into 'texts' . . . any number of them seem capable of a thoroughgoing rewriting into the postmodern text (one hesitates to think of the process in the same way as the adaptation of a novel to the screen, particularly since one of the features of postmodern cinema is the increasing scarcity of just such screen adaptations)." (Jameson 302)

"rewritten" modernist texts tell us something about the situation of "modernity" we share

modernism/modernity/modernization

"If, for example, modernization has something to do with industrial progress, rationalization, reorganization of production and administration along more efficient lines, electricity, the assembly line, parliamentary democracy, and cheap newspapers -- then we will have to conclude that at least one strand of artistic modernism is anti-modern and comes into being in violent or muffled protest against modernization, now grasped as technological progress in the largest sense." (Jameson 304)

"the deepest and most fundamental feature shared by all the modernisms is not so much their hostility to a technology some (like the Futurists) actually celebrated, but rather their hostility to the market itself.  The centrality of this feature is the confirmed by its inversion in the various postmodernisms, which, even more wildly different from each other than the various modernisms, all at least share a resonant affirmation, when not an outright celebration, of the market as such." (Jameson 304-305)

how to contend with the modernist "great artists," now that we have nothing like them? "What one must retain historically is the fact that the phenomenon did once exist; a postmodern view of the 'great' modernist creators ought not to argue away the social and historical specificity of those now doubtful 'centered subjects,' but rather provide new ways of understanding their conditions of possibility." (Jameson 306)

modern as "uneven development," coexistence of modernizing and archaic forces, shown in reading of Kafka; postmodern as thorough modernization, archaic swept away -- "This is the sense in which we can affirm, either that modernism is characterized by a situation of incomplete modernization, or that postmodernism is more modern than modernism itself." (Jameson 310)

modernity = "the way 'modern' people feel about themselves . . . the conviction that we ourselves are somehow new" (Jameson 310) -- lost in postmodernism

idea of the "new" in modernism raises question of "revolution," but we were taught that the moderns were (at best) apolitical -- not so: "I want, however, to propose the alternative proposition that modernism's introspective probing of the deeper impulses of consciousness, and even of the unconscious itself, was always accompanied by a Utopian sense of the impending transformation or transfiguration of the 'self' in question. . . . What we now have to grasp is that those feelings, expressed in connection with the self, could only come into being in correlation with a similar feeling about society and the object world itself." (Jameson 312)

III. CULTURAL REIFICATION AND THE "RELIEF" OF THE POSTMODERN

"If modernism thought of itself as a prodigious revolution in cultural production, however, postmodernism thinks of itself as a renewal of production as such after a long period of ossification and dwelling among dead monuments." (Jameson 313) -- the "relief" of the postmodern

postmodernism begins as modern "classics" enter school system and college reading lists?

canonization/corruption of high modernism leads to aesthetic break, producing relief

"reification" -- "the transformation of social relations into things" (Jameson 314); in Marx, clearly a negative, but the "things" have changed; more desirable

another definition of reification as "the 'effacement of the traces of production' from the object itself, from the commodity thereby produced" (Jameson 314) -- "For a society that wants to forget about class, therefore, reification in this consumer-packaging sense is very functional indeed" (Jameson 315)

the reification of culture? "what generates a radical separation between consumers and producers" (Jameson 315) -- leaves us with the subaltern's sense of inferiority before the machine

this sense of impotence dealt with via consumerism, which "disguises, represses, displaces, and sublimates a persistent and fundamental powerlessness" (Jameson 316)

"great modernist works" became reified monuments, paralyzing those below

"This is, then, the relief of the postmodern, in which the various modernist rituals were swept away and form production again became open to whoever cared to indulge in it" (Jameson 317) -- but at the price of the modernist formal values

IV. GROUPS AND REPRESENTATION

all preceding suggests that "postmodernism is popular (if not populist), and that it dismantles many of the barriers to cultural consumption that seemed implicit in modernism" (Jameson 318) -- but modernism was never hegemonic like postmodernism is

labels of "popularity" are always unreliable, as many groups refuse implication

microgroups read postmodernism as cover for affluent white male domination

micropolitics as postmodern phenomenon, arising in the void left by disappearance of social classes (?) and the global restructuration of production

self-congratulatory claims of "pluralism" thus obscene celebration of the system for producing "ever greater quantities of structurally unemployable subjects" (Jameson 320)

"This is the sense in which, even if Big Brother is not everwhere watching you, Language is; media and specialized language that seeks tirelessly to classify and categorize, to transform the individual into the labeled group" (Jameson 322)

"subject positions" as multiples of "group" membership

"the emergent groups as so many new markets for new products, so many new interpellations for the advertising image itself" (Jameson 325)

new "groups" as generated by system, or as agents of opposition to system? -- false opposition; see Marxist "voluntarism and determinism"

V. THE ANXIETY OF UTOPIA

easier to differ form postmodern ideologues in terms of content rather than form (?)

"totalization" as unification, coalitions (?) -- "if the word totality sometimes seems to suggest that some privileged bird's-eye view of the whole is available, which is also the Truth, then the project of totalization implies exactly the opposite and takes as its premise the impossibility for individual and biological human subjects to conceive of such a position, let alone adopt or achieve it" (Jameson 332)

totalization as the response to nominalism

hostility to totalization as hostility to collective project, Utopia; Utopia as "code word for the systemic transformation of contemporary society . . . the illusion of the possibility of some ultimate reunion between a subject and an object radically sundered" (Jameson 334)

anti-Utopian thought: argues that Utopian thinking is flawed; argues that Utopian thinking is dangerous -- "the libidinal fear or fantasy that Utopian society, the Utopian 'reconciliation of subject and object,' will somehow be a place of renunciation" (Jameson 335)

contradiction in anti-Utopian positions lies in the way what is identified as metaphysical (the idea of reconciliation) is projected onto a secular political ideal which seeks to end all metaphysical authority

VI. THE IDEOLOGY OF DIFFERENCE

ideology of difference (groups) not striking a blow against tyranny, but rather against consensus

"consensus" as (already beleaguered) representative democracy, challenged by groups

concept of difference is "booby-trapped" (Jameson 341)

"Much of what passes for a spirited defense of difference is, of course, simply liberal tolerance, a position whose offensive complacencies are well known but which has at least the merit of raising the embarrassing historical question of whether the tolerance of difference, as a social fact, is not the result of social homogenization and standardization and the obliteration of genuine social difference in the first place." (Jameson 341)

"Ethnicity in the postmodern, in other words -- neo-ethnicity -- is something of a yuppie phenomenon, and thereby without too many mediations a matter of fashion and the market." (Jameson 341)

"If what is historically unique about the postmodern is thus acknowledged as sheer heteronomy and the emergence of random and unrelated subsystems of all kinds, then, or so the argument runs, there has to be something perverse about the effort to grasp it as a unified system in the first place." (Jameson 342)

"I think one cannot too often emphasize the logical possibility, alongside both the old closed, centered subject of inner-directed individualism and the new non-subject of the fragmented or schizophrenic self, of a third term which would be very precisely the non-centered subject that is a part of an organic group or collective." (Jameson 345)

groups v. classes

"Since they have become images, groups allow the amnesia of their own bloody pasts, of persecution and untouchability, and can now be consumed: this marks their relationship to the media" (Jameson 347)

"Thus the newspaper plays an ideological role in our social order, but not because it is the plaything of a specific social group" (Jameson 347)

media journalists ≠ ideologues of big business

because the ideology of groups rises alongside the death of the subject, groups are not subjects

can no longer adequately represent the "ruling class"; "Only the media and the market are visible as autonomous entities" (Jameson 349) -- "media elite" as new ruling class?

Adorno and Horkheimer: movies and radio ideologized as "business" to justify mediocrity -- "the now classic Hollywood defense of mediocrity, not merely in terms of the general public's taste but in terms of their own function as a business selling products to a public with those tastes" (Jameson 351)

interiorization of the "profit motive doctrine"

postmodern mass culture more sophisticated, but "Adorno and Horkheimer's intuition of the ideology of the thing is even more profoundly true today than it was then.  For that very reason -- its  very universalization and interiorization -- it is less visible as such and has been transformed into a veritable second nature." (Jameson 351)

groups "in the know" of how the profit-driven system works and analogue for ruling class?

conflation of media and market

television coverage of war, etc.

tv coverage of JFK assassination: "this event was also something like the coming of age of the whole media culture that had been set in place in the late 1940s and the 1950s . . . television showed what it could really do and what it really meant -- a prodigious new display of synchronicity and a communicational situation that amounted to a dialectical leap over anything hitherto suspected." (Jameson 355)
VII. DEMOGRAPHIES OF THE POSTMODERN

postcolonialism: "The West thus has the impression that without much warning and unexpectedly it now confronts a range of genuine individual and collective subjects who were not there before, or not visible, or -- using Kant's great concept -- were still minor and under tutelage" (Jameson 356)

"the apparent celebration of Difference, whether here at home or on the global scale, in reality conceals and presupposes a new and more fundamental identity" (Jameson 357)

demography as materialism?

demographically, number of people currently living exceeds all who have lived and died; "But if this is so, then the relationship of the postmodern to historical consciousness now takes on a very different appearance, and there is some justification, and a plausible argument to be made, for consigning the past to oblivion as we seem to be doing; now that we, the living, have the preponderance, the authority of the dead -- hitherto based on sheer numbers -- diminishes at a dizzying rate" (Jameson 360)

past as little more than a matter for idle curiosity

global totality/synchronicity/television

VIII. SPATIAL HISTORIOGRAPHIES

spatiality v. temporality

sense in pm theory that late capitalism is spatialized in some unique fashion

postmodern "fantastic" historiography; two variants:

(1) semblance of historical verisimilitude, as though genre of historigraphy is maintained, but with untrammeled invention -- Pynchon's real sewer systems with imaginary crocodiles

(2) "purely fictional intent is underscored and reaffirmed in the production of imaginary people and events among whom from time to time real-life ones unexpectedly appear and disappear" (Jameson 369) -- Doctorow's real frogs in imaginary gardens

spatial movement between genres as channel-switching? "Channel switching, so often taken by media theorists as the very epitome of a postmodern attention and perceptual apparatus, does indeed seem to offer a useful alternative to the psychoanalytic model of multiple subject positions" (Jameson 373)

spatiality of newpaper layout; connections between columns reveal spatiality of history

IX. DECADENCE, FUNDAMENTALISM, AND HIGHTECH

decadence and sense of western exceptionalism

"Decadence is clearly something which both resists modernity and comes after it . . . it is thus the ghost of the superstructure, of cultural autonomy itself, that haunts the omnipotence of the base. 'Decadence' is thus in some way the very premonition of the postmodern itself" (Jameson 382)

"Where nature has vanished, however, and along with it the very 'otherness' that one can find offensive in the hubris and the exceptionalist ideology of modernism, the concept of decadence must then itself fade away, no longer available for characterizing and expressing our reactions to the postmodern." (383)

near/far-future "end of the world" nightmares as manifest content, masking more positive latent content of dreams: "In my opinion, what films like this 'mean' . . . is not the breakdown of high technology in a future time of troubles, but its conquest in the first place." (Jameson 384)

film special effects

religion and postmodernism: fundamentalism as postmodern phenomenon

"The very concept of belief is then the casualty of a period in which otherness as such -- valorized difference resulting in an exceptionalism of the present, with its subalternities of the past and of other cultures -- is critically grasped as a cornerstone of the modern and as its most deeply cherished superstition about itself." (Jameson 388)

"theological modernism seems to share with the other moderisms their constitutive sense of that radical otherness or difference of the past that constitutes us as modern people: the sense that everyone who went before us was therefore mot modern, but was traditional, and in that sense radically different in their ways of thinking and behaving." (Jameson 389)

"The hermeneutic task of theological modernism emerges from the desperate requirement to preserve or rewrite the meaning of an ancient precapitalist text within a situation of triumphant modernization" (Jameson 389) -- "A modernist hermeneutic then intervenes to save the day: the biblical narratives, including the gospel itself, are no longer to be taken literally -- that way Hollywood lies!" (Jameson 390)

X. THE PRODUCTION OF THEORETICAL DISCOURSE

postmodern thought as the thing we used to call "theory"

aesthetics of theoretical discourse: make no positive statements!

"Language, in other words, can no longer be true; but it can certainly be false; and the mission of theoretical discourse thus becomes a kind of search-and-destroy operation in which linguistic misconceptions are remorselessly identified and stigmatized" (Jameson 392-93)

however, every negative statement begins to generate the ideological illusion of a positive one

"All of which clearly tends to reduce linguistic expression generally to a function of commentary, that is, of a permanently second-degree relationship to sentences that have already been formed" (Jameson 393) -- "a linguistic solution nonetheless remains, and it turns on what has hitherto been called transcoding" (Jameson 393)

worldviews have become "codes"; where one used to hold a belief, one now speaks an idiolect

new possibility: the production of new codes: "New theoretical discourse is produced by the setting into active equivalence of two preexisting codes, which thereby, in a kind of molecular ion exchange, become a new one." (Jameson 394)

"Hegemony means the possibility of recoding vast quantities of preexisting discourse (in other languages) into the new code" (Jameson 395)

"Transcoding and the production of theoretical discourse are a flight forward, as the French say, and their momentum is maintained by what burns all the bridges and makes retreat impossible, namely, the growing old of the codes, the planned obsolescence of all the older theoretical machinery." (Jameson 397)

"the consitutive feature in what Stuart Hall calls the 'discursive struggle' over the delegitimation of opposing ideologies (or 'discourses'): worse than incorrect, immoral, evil, or dangerous, is the apprehension that a particular code is simply one code among others, and that an 'older' one has thereby and virtually by definition become 'optional.'" (Jameson 397)

but ideologies are no longer determinant; ideology is over, not because class struggle is over, but because ideology is no longer functional

Adorno: "in our time the commodity has ... become its own ideology"

death of intellectual culture, presided over by media and the market

XI. HOW TO MAP A TOTALITY

"totalizing" approach to postmodernism

"If postmodernism, as an enlarged third stage of classical capitalism, is a purer and more homogeneous expression of classical capitalism, from which many of the hitherto surviving enclaves of socio-economic difference have been effaced . . . then it makes sense to suggest that the waning of our sense of history, and more particularly our resistance to globalizing or totalizing concepts like that of the mode of production itself, are a function of precisely that universalization of capitalism." (Jameson 405)

cognitive mapping -- but not map

three kinds of space for three stages of capitalism: (1) grid, (2) network, (3) relentlessly saturated space

cognitive mapping as spatial analogue of Althusser's definition of Ideology as "the imaginary representation of the subject's relationship to his or her real conditions of existence"

cognitive mapping involves extrapolation of spatial analysis to the realm of social structure

"The postmodern may well in that sense be little more than a transitional period between two stages of capitalism, in which the earlier forms of the economic are in the process of being restructured on a global scale, including the older forms of labor and its traditional organizational institutions and concepts." (Jameson 417)

"'Cognitive mapping' was in reality nothing but a code word for 'class consciousness' -- only it proposed the need for a class consciousness of a new and hitherto undreamed of kind" (Jameson 417-18)
