Butler, Judith P. The Psychic Life of Power: Theories in Subjection. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1997.


Introduction

"As a form of power, subjection is paradoxical.  To be dominated by a power external to oneself is a familiar and agonizing form power takes.  To find, however, that what 'one' is, one's very formation as a subject, is in some sense dependent upon that very power is quite another." (Butler 1-2)

"if, following Foucault, we understand power as *forming* the subject as well, as providing the very condition of its existence and the trajectory of its desire, then power is not simply what we oppose but also, and in a strong sense, what we depend on for our existence and what we harbor and preserve in the beings that we are." (Butler 2)

"Subjection consists precisely in this fundamental dependency on a discourse we never chose but that, paradoxically, initiates and sustains our agency." (Butler 2)

"'Subjection' signifies the process of becoming subordinated by power as well as the process of becoming a subject." (Butler 2)

"if submission is a condition of subjection, it makes sense to ask: What is the psychic form that power takes? Such a project requires thinking the theory of power together with a theory of the psyche, a task that has been eschewed by writers in both Foucauldian and psychoanalytic orthodoxies.  Though it offers no promise of a grand synthesis, the present inquiry seeks to explore the provisional perspectives from which each theory illuminates the other." (Butler 2-3)

"In each case, power that at first appears as external, pressed upon the subject, pressing the subject into subordination, assumes a psychic form that constitutes the subject's self-identity." (Butler 3)

"The moment we seek to determine how power produces its subject, how the subject takes in the power by which it is inauguration, we seem to enter this tropological quandary.  We cannot presume a subject who performs an internalization if the formation of the subject is in need of explanation.... The paradox of subjection implies a paradox of referentiality: namely, that we must refer to what does not yet exist." (Butler 4)

on Althusser's scene of interpellation:  "Significantly, Althusser does not offer a clue as to why that individual turns around, accepting the voice as being addressed to him or her, and accepting the subordination and normalization effected by that voice.... Is this a guilty subject and, if so, how did it become guilty?  Might the theory of interpellation require a theory of conscience?" (Butler 5)

-- Passionate Attachments

"I would maintain that the attachment to subjection is produced through the workings of power, and that part of the operation of power is made clear in this psychic effect, one of the most insidious of its productions." (Butler 6)

"If the effect of autonomy is conditioned by subordination and that founding subordination or dependency is rigorously repressed, the subject emerges in tandem with the unconscious." (Butler 7)

"no subject emerges without a passionate attachment to those on whom he or she is fundamentally dependent (even if that passion is 'negative' in the psychoanalytic sense)." (Butler 7)

"If there is no formation of the subject without a passionate attachment to those by whom she or he is subordinated, then subordination proves central to the becoming of the subject." (Butler 7)

"This is to say, not that the child loves blindly (since from early on there is discernment and 'knowingness' of an important kind), but only that if the child is to persist in a psychic and social sense, there must be dependency and the formation of attachment: there is no possibility of not loving, where love is bound up with the requirements for life.... No subject can emerge without this attachment, formed in dependency, but no subject, in the course of its formation, can ever afford fully to 'see' it." (Butler 8)

"Desire will aim at unraveling the subject, but be thwarted by precisely the subject in whose name it operates.... A subject turned against itself (its desire) appears, on this model, to be a condition of the persistence of the subject." (Butler 9)

"What does it mean to embrace the very form of power -- regulation, prohibition, suppression -- that threatens one with dissolution in an effort, precisely, to persist in one's own existence?  It is not simply that one requires the recognition of the other and that a form of recognition is conferred through subordination, but rather that one is dependent on power for one's very formation, that that formation is impossible without dependency, and that the posture of the adult subject consists precisely in the denial and reenactment of this dependency." (Butler 9)

-- Ambivalence

"I propose to take account of how a paradox recurrently structures the debate, leading it almost always to culminate in displays of ambivalence.  How can it be that the subject, taken to be the condition for and instrument of agency, is at the same time the effect of subordination, understood as the deprivation of agency?" (Butler 10)

"'The subject' is sometimes bandied about as if it were interchangeable with 'the person' or 'the individual.'  The genealogy of the subject as a critical category, however, suggests that the subject, rather than be identified strictly with the individual, ought to be designated as a linguistic category, a placeholder, a structure in formation.  Individuals come to occupy the site of the subject (the subject simultaneously emerges as a 'site'), and they enjoy intelligibility only to the extent that they are, as it were, first established in language." (Butler 10-11)

"On the one hand, the subject can refer to its own genesis only by taking a third-person perspective on itself, that is, by dispossessing its own perspective in the act of narrating its genesis.  On the other hand, the narration of how the subject is constituted presupposes that the constitution has already taken place, and thus arrives after the fact.  The subject loses itself to tell the story of itself, but in telling the story of itself seeks to give an account of what the narrative function has already made plain." (Butler 11)

"A power *exerted on* a subject, subjection is nevertheless a power *assumed by* the subject, an assumption that constitutes the instrument of that subject's becoming." (Butler 11)

-- Subjection/Subordination

"What does it mean for the agency of a subject to *presuppose* its own subordination?  Is the act of *presupposing* the same as the act of *reinstating*, or is there a discontinuity between the power presupposed and the power reinstated?" (Butler 12)

"A significant and potentially enabling reversal occurs when power shifts from its status as a condition of agency to the subject's 'own' agency (constituting an appearance of power in which the subject appears as the condition of its 'own' power)." (Butler 12)

"Assuming power is not a straightforward task of taking power from one place, transferring it intact, and then and there making it one's own; the act of appropriation may involve an alteration of power such that the power assumed or appropriated works against the power that made that assumption possible." (Butler 13)

"This conclusion is not to be thought of as (a) a resistance that is *really* a recuperation of power or (b) a recuperation that is *really* a resistance.  It is both at once, and this ambivalence forms the bind of agency." (Butler 13)

"Because Power is not intact prior to the subject, the appearance of its priority disappears as power acts on the subject, and the subject is inaugurated (and derived) through this temporal reversal in the horizon of power.  As the agency of the subject, power assumes its present temporal dimension." (Butler 13-14)

"As a subject *of* power (where 'of' connotes both 'belonging to' and 'wielding'), the subject eclipses the conditions of its own emergence; it eclipses power with power." (Butler 14)

"as the willed effect of the subject, subjection is a subordination that the subject brings on itself; yet if subjection produces a subject and a subject is the precondition of agency, then subjection is the account by which a subject becomes the guarantor of its resistance and opposition." (Butler 14)

"the subject is itself a site of this ambivalence in which the subject emerges both as the *effect* of a prior power and as the *condition of possibility* for a radically conditioned form of agency" (Butler 14-15)

"Power acts on the subject, an acting that is an enacting: an irresolvable ambiguity arises when one attempts to distinguish between the power that (transitively) enacts the subject, and the power enacted by the subject, that is, between the power that forms the subject and the subject's 'own' power." (Butler 15)

"One might say that the purposes of power are not always the purposes of agency.  To the extent that the latter diverge from the former, agency is the assumption of a purpose *unintended* by power, one that could not have been derived logically or historically, that operates in a relation of contingency and reversal to the power that makes it possible, to which it nevertheless belongs." (Butler 15)

"Power is never merely a condition external or prior to the subject, nor can it be exclusively identified with the subject.  If conditions of power are to persist, they must be reiterated; the subject is precisely the site of such reiteration, a repetition that is never merely mechanical." (Butler 16)

"how to take an oppositional relation to power that is, admittedly, implicated in the very power one opposes.  Often this postliberatory insight has led to the conclusion that all agency here meets its impasse.... That agency is implicated in subordination is not the sign of a fatal self-contradiction at the core of the subject and, hence, further proof of its pernicious or obsolete character.  But neither does it restore a pristine notion of the subject, derived from some classical liberal-humanist formulation, whose agency is always and only opposed to power." (Butler 17)

"If the subject is *neither* fully determined by power *nor* fully determining of power (but significantly and partially both), the subject exceeds the logic of noncontradiction, is an excrescence of logic, as it were." (Butler 17)

"Power rearticulated is 're'-articulated in the sense of already done and 're'-articulated in the sense of done again, done anew." (Butler 18)

-- Regulations of the Psyche

"an account of subjection, it seems, must be traced in the turns of psychic life.  More specifically, it must be traced in the peculiar turning of a subject against itself that takes place in acts of self-reproach, conscience, and melancholia that work in tandem with processes of social regulation." (Butler 18-19)

"Is the norm first 'outside,' and does it then enter into a pre-given psychic space, understood as an interior theater of some kind?  Or does the internalization of the norm contribute to the production of internality?... I argue that this process of internalization *fabricates the distinction between interior and exterior life*, offering us a distinction between the psychic and the social that differs significantly from an account of the psychic internalization of norms." (Butler 19)

"Precisely at the moment in which choices is impossible, the subject pursues subordination as the promise of existence.  This pursuit is not choice, but neither is it necessity.  Subjection exploits the desire for existence, where existence is always conferred from elsewhere; it marks a primary vulnerability to the Other in order to be." (Butler 20-21)

"In other words, to the extent that norms operate as psychic phenomena, restricting and producing desire, they also govern the formation of the subject and circumscribe the domain of a livable sociality.  The psychic operation of the norm offers a more insidious route for regulatory power than explicit coercion, one whose success allows its tacit operation within the social.  And yet, being psychic, the norm does not merely reinstate social power, it becomes formative and vulnerable in highly specific ways."  (Butler 21)

"Freud and Nietzsche offer differing accounts of subject formation that rely on the productivity of the norm.  Both account for the fabrication of conscience as the effect of an internalized prohibition (thereby establishing 'prohibition' as not only privative, but productive).  In Freud and Nietzsche, a prohibition on action or expression is said to turn 'the drive' back on itself, fabricating an internal sphere, the condition for self-inspection and reflexivity.... Whether the doubling back upon itself is performed by primary longings, desire, or drives, it produces in each instance a psychic habit of self-beratement, one that is consolidated over time as conscience." (Butler 22)

"Conscience is the means by which a subject becomes and object for itself, reflecting on itself, establishing itself as reflective and reflexive." (Butler 22)

"For Nietzsche, reflexivity is a consequence of conscience; self-knowing follows from self-punishment.... In order to curb desire, one makes of oneself an object for reflection; in the course of producing one's own alterity, one becomes established as a reflexive being, one who can take oneself as an object.... The doubling back of desire that culminates in reflexivity produces, however, another order of desire: the desire for that very circuit, for reflexivity and, ultimately, for subjection." (Butler 22)

"Freud distinguishes between repression and foreclosure, suggesting that a repressed desire might once have lived apart from its prohibition, but that foreclosed desire is rigorously barred, constituting the subject through a certain kind of preemptive loss." (Butler 23)

"The foreclosure of certain forms of love suggests that the melancholia that grounds the subject (and hence always threatens to unsettle and disrupt that ground) signals an incomplete and irresolvable grief." (Butler 23)

"For a loss to predate the subject, to make it possible (and impossible), we must consider the part that loss plays in subject formation.  Is there a loss that cannot be thought, cannot be owned or grieved, which forms the condition of possibility for the subject?" (Butler 24)

"what happens when a certain foreclosure of love becomes the condition of possibility for social existence?  Does this not produce a sociality afflicted by melancholia, a sociality in which loss cannot be grieved because it cannot be recognized as loss, because what is lost never had any entitlement to existence?" (Butler 24)

"As foreclosure, the sanction works not to prohibit existing desire but to produce certain kinds of objects and bar others from the field of social production." (Butler 25)

"Guilt serves the function of preserving the object of love and, hence, of preserving love itself.... As a stopgap against a sadistic destruction, guilt signals less the psychic presence of an originally social and external norm than a countervailing desire to continue the object one wishes dead." (Butler 25)

"In one sense, guilt works to thwart the aggressive expression of love that might do in the loved object, an object understood to be a source of love; in a counter sense, however, guilt works to preserve the object as an object of love (its idealization) and hence (via idealization) to preserve the possibility of loving and being loved." (Butler 26)

"the relation between love and aggression.  Why might one want dead the object of love?  Is this a primary sadism that might be explained by recourse to a primary death drive, or are there other ways to account for the desire to vanquish what one loves?" (Butler 26)

"What is it, then, that is desired in subjection?  Is it a simple love of the shackles, or is there a more complex scenario at work?... On this understanding, subjection is the paradoxical effect of a regime of power in which the very 'conditions of existence,' the possibility of continuing as a recognizable social being, requires the formation and maintenance of the subject in subordination." (Butler 27)

"What would it mean for the subject to desire something other than its continued 'social existence'?  If such an existence cannot be undone without falling into some kind of death, can existence nevertheless be risked, death courted or pursued, in order to expose and open to transformation the hold of social power on the conditions of life's persistence?" (Butler 28)

"a caution against two forms of theoretical desire: one in which assuming and stating a 'subject-position' is the consummate moment of politics; and another in which the dismissal of the subject as a philosophical trope underestimates the linguistic requirements for entering sociality at all." (Butler 29)

"Is there a way to affirm complicity as the basis of political agency, yet insist that political agency may do more than reiterate the conditions of subordination?" (Butler 29-30)


1.  Stubborn Attachment, Bodily Subjection:  Rereading Hegel on the Unhappy Consciousness

"Foucault has suggested that the point of modern politics is no longer to liberate a subject, but rather to interrogate the regulatory mechanisms through which 'subjects' are produced and maintained." (Butler 31-32)

"The permutations of self-enslavement that Hegel describes appear to take the body as what must be negated, mortified, or subordinated to an ethical demand." (Butler 32)

"The limits to liberation are to be understood not merely as self-imposed but, more fundamentally, as the precondition of the subject's very formation.  A certain structuring attachment *to* subjection becomes the condition of moral subjectivation." (Butler 33)

"Hegel shows that if the suppression of the body requires an instrumental movement of and by the body, then the body is inadvertently *preserved* in and by the instrument of its suppression." (Butler 33)

-- Hegel and the Production of Self-Enslavement

"The bondsman appears as an instrumental body whose labor provides for the material conditions of the lord's existence, and whose material products reflect both the subordination of the bondsman and the domination of the master.  In a sense, the lord postures as a disembodied desire for self-reflection, one who not only requires the subordination of the bondsman in the status of an instrumental body, but who requires in effect that the bondsman *be* the lord's body, but be it in such a way that the lord forgets or disavows his own activity in producing the bondman, a production which we will call a projection." (Butler 35)

"To disavow one's body, to render it 'Other' and then to establish the 'Other' as an effect of autonomy, is to produce one's body in such a way that the activity of its production -- and its essential relation to the lord -- is denied." (Butler 35)

"As the bondsman slaves away and becomes aware of his own signature on the things that he makes, he recognizes in the form of the artifact that he crafts the markings of his own labor, markings that are formative of the object itself.  His labor produces a visible and legible set of marks in which the bondsman reads back from the object a confirmation of his own formative activity." (Butler 36)

"only by miming and covering over the mimetic status of that labor can the bondsman appear to be both active and autonomous." (Butler 36-37)

"If the bondsman is to recognize the marks made on the object as his own, then that recognition must take place through an act of reading or interpretation by which the marks (*Zeichen*) that the bondsman sees are somehow understood to represent the bondsman.  It is not that the activity must be witnessed, but that the *signs* produced must be read as an effect of the effectivity that designates the bondsman, must in some way be understood to refer retroactively to the bondsman as signatory." (Butler 37-38)

"The mark or sign on the object is not simply the property of the bondsman -- this object with his mark on it implies for him that he is a being who marks things, whose activity produces a singular effect, a signature, which is irreducibly his.  That signature is erased when the object is given over to the lord, who stamps it with *his* name, owns it, or consumes it in some way.  The working of the slave is thus to be understood as a marking which regularly unmarks itself, a signatory act which puts itself under erasure at the moment in which it is circulated, for circulation here is always a matter of expropriation by the lord." (Butler 38)

"Strangely, then, a certain self-recognition is derived from the radically tenuous status of the bondsman; it is achieved through the experience of *absolute fear*" (Butler 39)

"In the experience of giving up what he has made, the bondsman understands two issues: first, that what he is is embodied or signified in what he makes, and second, that what he makes is made under the compulsion to give it up.  Hence, if the object defines him, reflects back what he is, is the signatory text by which he acquires a sense of who he is, and if those objects are relentlessly sacrificed, then he is a relentlessly self-sacrificing being.  He can recognize his own signature only as what is constantly being erased, as a persistent site of vanishing." (Butler 40)

"because the object is given away, he becomes that which can be forfeited." (Butler 41)

"The bondsman not only negates things (in the sense of transforming them through labor) and is a negating activity, but he is subject to a full and final negation in death.... The failure of domination as a strategy *re*introduces the fear of death, but locates it as the inevitable fate of any being whose consciousness is determined and embodied, no longer as a threat posed by another." (Butler 41)

"No longer subjected as an external instrument of labor, the body is still split off from consciousness.  Reconstituted as an interior alien, the body is sustained through its disavowal as what consciousness must continue to disavow." (Butler 42)

"Absolute fear would jeopardize all determinate things, including the determinate thingness of the bondsman.  The flight from that fear, a fear of death, vacates the thinglike character of the subject.  This entails vacating the body and clinging to what appears to be most disembodied: thought." (Butler 43)

"The watching self, defined as a kind of *witnessing* and *scorning*, differentiates itself from the self witnessed as perpetually falling into contradiction.  This watching becomes a way of *re*establishing the visual distance between a subject aloof from the scene and the subject in contradiction.  In this case, however, the witnessing and scorning self cannot deny that the contradictory self is its own self; it knows that the contradictory self is *itself*, but in order to shore up an identity over and against it, it renders this contradictory self into an *in*essential part of itself.  It thus parts with itself in order to purify itself of contradiction." (Butler 46)

"Unhappy consciousness seeks to overcome this duality be finding a body which embodies the purity of its unchangeable part; it seeks to come into relation with 'the Unchangeable in its incarnate or embodied form'." (Butler 47)

"The subject who would subordinate its body to an ideal, compel its body to embody an ideal, finds itself more fully autonomous from that ideal, outliving it altogether." (Butler 48)

"The renunciation of the self as the origin of its own actions must be performed repeatedly and can never finally be achieved, if only because the *demonstration* of renunciation is itself a self-willed action." (Butler 49)

"Regarding itself as a nothing, as a doing of nothing, as an excremental function, and hence regarding itself as excrement, this consciousness effectively reduces itself to the changeable features of its bodily functions and products.  Yet, since it is an experience *of* wretchedness, there is some consciousness which takes stock of these functions and which is not thoroughly identified with them." (Butler 50-51)

"In order to reconnect with the pure and unchangeable, this bodily consciousness offers up its every 'doing' to a priest or minister.  This mediating agency relieves the abject consciousness of its responsibility for its own actions.... Everything the abject consciousness offers, that is, all of its externalizations, including desire, work, and excrement, are to be construed as *offerings*, as paying penance." (Butler 51)

Hegel's closing transitions to The Unhappy Consciousness:  "The mediator or the priest counsels that penitent that his pain will be repaid with everlasting abundance, that his misery will be rewarded with everlasting happiness; misery and pain imply a future transformation into their opposites.... Whereas in all the earlier examples of self-negation pleasure was understood to *inhere* in pain (the pleasurable aggrandizement of the stoic, the pleasurable sadism of the skeptic), pleasure is here temporally removed from pain, figured as its future compensation.  For Hegel, this eschatological transformation of the pain of this world into the pleasure of the next establishes the transition from self-consciousness to reason." (Butler 52-53)

"Every effort to reduce itself to inaction or to nothing, to subordinate or mortify its own body, culminates inadvertently in the *production* of self-consciousness as a pleasure-seeking and self-aggrandizing agent.  Every effort to overcome the body, pleasure, and agency proves to be nothing other than the assertion of precisely those features of the subject." (Butler 53)

-- Post-Hegelian Subjections

"The ethical refusal and subordination of the body might then be understood as a magical effort to preempt that existential negation." (Butler 54)

"The repression of the libido is always understood as itself a libidinally invested repression.  Hence, the libido is not absolutely negated through repression, but rather becomes the instrument of its own subjection.  The repressive law is not external to the libido that it represses, but the repressive law represses to the extent that repression becomes a libidinal activity." (Butler 55)

"If the suppression of the body is itself an instrumental movement of and by the body, then the body is inadvertently preserved in and by the instrument of its suppression.  The self-defeating effort of such suppression, however, not only leads to its opposite -- a self-congratulatory or self-aggrandizing assertion of desire, will, the body -- in more contemporary formulations it leads to the elaboration of an institution of the subject which exceeds the dialectical frame by which it is spawned." (Butler 57)

"We can see in both Hegel and Freud a certain reliance on a dialectical reversal by which a bodily experience, broadly construed, comes under the censor of the law only to reemerge as the sustaining affect of that law." (Butler 58)

"The inadvertently productive effects of sublimation in the formation of cultural products appear to exceed the dialectical reversal by which they are generated." (Butler 58)

"For Foucault, repression does not act on a pregiven field of pleasure and desire; it constitutes that field as that which is to be regulated, that which is always potentially or actually under the rubric of regulation." (Butler 58)

"In what many have come to see as a finally utopian gesture in Foucault, this proliferation of the body by juridical regimes beyond the terms of dialectical reversal is also the site of possible resistance.  The psychoanalytic discourse that would describe and pathologize repressed desire ends up producing a discursive incitement to desire" (Butler 59)

"What Hegel implies in 'The Unhappy Consciousness' is not merely that moral wretchedness cannot be coherently sustained, that it invariably concedes the bodily being that it seeks to deny, but that the pursuit of wretchedness, the attachment to wretchedness, is both the condition and the potential undoing of such subjection." (Butler 61)

"the desire to desire is a willingness to desire precisely that which would foreclose desire, if only for the possibility of continuing to desire." (Butler 61)


2.  Circuits of Bad Conscience: Nietzsche and Freud

"In Nietzsche, who distinguishes conscience from bad conscience, the will is said to turn back on itself.  But what are we to make of this strange locution; how are we being asked to imagine a will such that it recoils and redoubles upon itself; and how, most pertinently, is this figure being offered as a way to articulate the kind of reflexivity central to the operation of bad conscience?" (Butler 63)

"Why does a body doubled over on itself figure what it means to be a self-conscious sort of being?" (Butler 64)

"I would suggest that the subject who would oppose violence, even violence to itself, is itself the effect of a prior violence without which the subject could not have emerged." (Butler 64)

"This recasting of the 'will' is not, properly speaking, the will of a subject, nor is it an effect fully cultivated by and through social norms; it is, I would suggest, the site at which the social implicates the psychic in its very formation -- or, to be more precise, *as* its very formation and formativity." (Butler 66)

"Although one is tempted to claim that social regulation is simply internalized, taken from the outside and brought into the psyche, the problem is much more complicated and, indeed, more insidious.  For the boundary that divides the outside from the inside is in the process of being installed, precisely through the regulation of the subject." (Butler 66-67)

"Nietzsche attributes a creative or formative power to conscience, and the act of turning back upon oneself is not only the condition of possibility of the subject, but the condition of the possibility of fiction, fabrication, and transfiguration.  Indeed, Nietzsche remarks that bad conscience *fabricates* the soul, that expanse of interior psychic space." (Butler 67)

"The claim that conscience is a fiction is not to be confused with the claim that conscience is arbitrary or dispensable; on the contrary, it is a necessary fiction, one without which the grammatical and phenomenological subject cannot exist." (Butler 68)

"Considered grammatically, it will seem that there must first be a subject who turns back on itself, yet I will argue that there is no subject except as a consequence of this very reflexivity.  How can the subject be presumed at both ends of this process, especially when it is the very formation of the subject for which this process seeks to give an account?" (Butler 68)

"the strength of conscience correlates neither with the strength of a punishment received nor with the strength of a memory of a punishment received, *but with the strength of one's own aggression*, one which is said to have vented itself externally, but which now, under the rubric of bad conscience, is said to vent itself internally." (Butler 70)

-- Nietzsche's Account of Bad Conscience

"the desire to punish cannot be fully accounted for by the circumstances of the broken contract.  Why does the creditor take pleasure in the inflection of injury, and what form does that pleasure take when injury is inflicted in the moralized action by which the creditor holds the debtor morally accountable and pronounces him guilty?  What strange consummation of pleasure takes place in that attribution of guilt?" (Butler 73)

"Bad conscience would be the fabrication of interiority that attends the breaking of a promise, the discontinuity of the will, but the 'I' who would keep the promise is precisely the cultivated effect of this continuous fabrication of interiority.  Can there even be a promising being, one who is able to discharge words into deeds, without the bad conscience which forms the very 'I' who makes good his word through time, who has a memory of the will, and for whom the psyche has already been produced?" (Butler 75)

"where is the trace of this freedom in the self-shackling that Nietzsche describes?  It is to be found in the pleasure taken in afflicting pain, a pleasure taken in afflicting pain on oneself in the service of, in the name of, morality.... The origin of bad conscience is, thus, the joy taken in persecuting oneself, where the self persecuted does not exist outside the orbit of that persecution." (Butler 75)

"Punishment is not merely productive of the self, but this very productivity of punishment is the site for the freedom and pleasure of the will, its fabricating activity." (Butler 75)

"The soul is precisely what a certain violent artistry produces when it takes itself as its own object." (Butler 76)

"If all 'imaginative phenomena' are the result of this violent interiorization, it follows that the genealogical account will be one of these phenomena, a narrative effect of the narrative it seeks to tell.  The unmasking of the narrative is its remasking -- inevitably.  Indeed, it seems that the very creativity one seeks to oppose to the inhibition of strength is fundamentally dependent on that very inhibition.  In this sense, repression appears to underwrite or guarantee both the being who promises and the writer of fiction, including conceptual fictions such as genealogy." (Butler 77-78)

-- Freud, Narcissism, and Regulation

"How can cultivating a narcissistic attachment to punishment be the means by which the power of social regulation exploits a narcissistic demand for self-reflection which is indifferent to its occasion?" (Butler 78)

"The repression of the libido is always to be understood as itself a libidinally invested repression.  Hence, the libido is not absolutely negated through repression, but rather becomes the instrument of its own subjection.  The repressive law is not external to the libido that it represses, but the repressive law represses to the extent that the repression becomes a libidinal activity." (Butler 79)

"According to Freud, then, the self-imposed imperatives that characterize the circular route of conscience are pursued and applied precisely because they are now the site of the very satisfaction that they seek to prohibit.  In other words, prohibition becomes the occasion for reliving the instinct under the rubric of the condemning law." (Butler 81)

"renunciation takes place through the very desire that is renounced: the desire is *never* renounced, but becomes preserved and reasserted in the very structure of renunciation." (Butler 81)


3.  Subjection, Resistance, Resignification:  Between Freud and Foucault

"The term 'subjectivation' carries the paradox in itself: *assujetissement* denotes both the becoming of the subject and the process of subjection -- one inhabits the figure of autonomy only be becoming subjected to a power, a subjection which implies a radical dependency." (Butler 83)

"In _Discipline and Punish_ the prisoner's body not only appears as a *sign* of guilt and transgression, as the embodiment of prohibition and the sanction for rituals of normalization, but is framed and formed through the discursive matrix of a juridical subject." (Butler 83-84)

"Hence, subjection is neither simply the domination of a subject nor its production, but designates a certain kind of restriction *in* production, a restriction without which the production of the subject cannot take place, a restriction through which that production takes place." (Butler 84)

"This normative ideal inculcated, as it were, into the prisoner is a kind of psychic identity, or what Foucault will call a 'soul.'  Because the soul is an imprisoning effect, Foucault claims that the prisoner is subjected 'in a more fundamental way' than by the spatial captivity of the prison.  Indeed, in the citation that follows, the soul is figured as itself a kind of spatial captivity, indeed, as a kind of prison, which provides the exterior form or regulatory principle of the prisoner's body." (Butler 85)

"If discourse produces identity by supplying and enforcing a regulatory principle which thoroughly invades, totalizes, and renders coherent the individual, then it seems that every 'identity,' insofar as it is totalizing, acts as precisely such a 'soul that imprisons the body.'" (Butler 85-86)

"the psyche, which includes the unconscious, is very different from the subject: the psyche is precisely what exceeds the imprisoning effects of the discursive demand to inhabit a coherent identity, to become a coherent subject." (Butler 86)

"The question of a suppressed psychoanalysis in Foucault... might be raised more precisely as the problem of locating or accounting for resistance.  Where does resistance to or in disciplinary subject formation take place?" (Butler 87)

"First, if Foucault understands the psyche to be an imprisoning effect in the service of normalization, then how might he account for psychic resistance to normalization?  Second, when some proponents of psychoanalysis insist that resistance to normalization is a function of the unconscious, is this guarantee of psychic resistance merely sleight of hand?" (Butler 87-88)

"What makes us think that the unconscious is any less structured by the power relations that pervade cultural signifiers than is the language of the subject?" (Butler 88)

"given the radical exteriority of the soul, how are we to understand 'interiority' in Foucault?  That interiority will not be a soul, and it will not be a psyche, but what will it be?  Is this a space of pure malleability, one which is, as it were, ready to conform to the demands of socialization?  Or is this interiority to be called, simply, the body?  Has it come to the paradoxical point where Foucault wants to claim that the soul is the exterior form, and the body the interior space?" (Butler 89)

"We can understand Foucault's references to the soul as an implicit reworking of the Aristotelian formulation in which the soul is understood to be the form and principle of the body's matter." (Butler 90)

"In this formulation, there is no body outside of power, for the materiality of the body -- indeed, materiality itself -- is produced by and in direct relation to the investment of power.... To be grammatically accurate, there is no prison prior to its materialization; its materialization is coextensive with its investiture with power relations; and materiality is the effect and gauge of this investment.... Here the body -- of the prisoner and of the prison -- is not an independent materiality, a static surface or site, which a subsequent investment comes to mark signify upon, or pervade; the body is that for which materialization and investiture are coextensive." (Butler 91)

"Foucault suggests that the production of the 'subject' takes place to some degree through the subordination and even destruction of the body." (Butler 91)

"The subject appears at the expense of the body, an appearance conditioned in inverse relation to the disappearance of the body.... Here the forming and framing function of that exterior soul works against the body; indeed, it might be understood as the sublimation of the body in consequence of displacement and substitution." (Butler 91-92)

"If the body is subordinated and to some extent destroyed as the dissociated self emerges, and if that emergence might be read as the sublimation of the body and the self be read as the body's ghostly form, then is there some part of the body which is not preserved in sublimation, some party of the body which remains unsublimated?" (Butler 92)

"But more often than not, in Foucault the possibility of subversion or resistance appears (a) in the course of a subjectivation that exceeds the normalizing aims by which it is mobilized, for example, in 'reverse-discourse,' or (b) through convergence with other discursive regimes, whereby inadvertently produced discursive complexity undermines the teleological aims of normalization." (Butler 92-93)

"For Foucault, the subject who is produced through subjection is not produced at an instant in its totality.  Instead, it is in the process of being produced, it is repeatedly produced (which is not the same as being produced anew again and again)." (Butler 93)

"The Foucaultian subject is never fully constituted in subjection, then; it is repeatedly constituted in subjection, and it is in the possibility of a repetition that repeats against its origin that subjection might be understood to draw its inadvertently enabling power." (Butler 94)

"What can we make of the way in which discourses not only constitute the domains of the speakable, but are themselves bounded through the production of a constitutive outside: the unspeakable, the unsignifiable?" (Butler 94)

"As Althusser himself insists, this performative effort of naming can only *attempt* to bring its addressee into being: there is always the risk of a certain *misrecognition*.  If one misrecognizes that effort to produce the subject, the production itself falters." (Butler 95)

"The Althusserian use of Lacan centers on the function of the imaginary as the permanent possibility of *misrecognition*, that is, the incommensurability between symbolic demand (the name that is interpellated) and the instability and unpredictability of its appropriation.  If the interpellated name seeks to accomplish the identity to which it refers, it begins as a performative process which is nevertheless derailed in the imaginary, for the imaginary is surely preoccupied with the law, structured by the law, but does not immediately obey the law.... Identity can never be fully totalized by the symbolic, for what it fails to order will emerge within the imaginary as a disorder, a site where identity is contested." (Butler 96-97)

"Foucault formulates resistance as an effect of the very power that it is said to oppose.... Foucault's conception initiates a shift from a discourse on law, conceived as juridical (and presupposing a subject subordinated by power), to a discourse on power, which is a field of productive, regulatory, and contestatory relations.  For Foucault, the symbolic produces the possibility of its own subversions, and these subversions are unanticipated effects of symbolic interpellations." (Butler 98-99)

"disciplinary discourse does not unilaterally constitute a subject in Foucault, or rather, if it does, it *simultaneously* constitutes the condition for the subject's de-constitution." (Butler 99)

"Indeed, I would add, a subject only remains a subject through a reiteration or rearticulation of itself as a subject, and this dependency of the subject on repetition for coherence may constitute that subject's incoherence, its incomplete character." (Butler 99)

on the two senses in which "queer" can be used: "not an opposition between reactionary and progressive usage, but rather a progressive usage that requires and repeats the reactionary in order to effect a subversive reterritorialization." (Butler 100)

"why can Foucualt formulate resistance in relation to the disciplinary power of sexuality in _The History of Sexuality_, whereas in _Discipline and Punish_ disciplinary power appears to determine docile bodies incapable of resistance?  Is there something about the relationship of *sexuality* to power that conditions the possibility of resistance in the first text, and a noted absence of a consideration of sexuality from the discussion of power and bodies in the second?" (Butler 101)

"To what extent has the disciplinary apparatus that attempts to produce and totalize identity become an abiding object of passionate attachment?" (Butler 102)

"If the ego is composed of identifications, and identification is the resolution of desire, then the ego is the residue of desire, the effect of incorporations which, Freud argues in _The Ego and the Id_, trace a lineage of attachment and loss." (Butler 102-103)

"Only on the condition of a separation enforced through prohibition does a subject emerge, formed through the attachment to prohibition (in obedience to it, but also eroticizing it)." (Butler 103)

"Indeed, prohibition becomes an odd form of preservation, a way of eroticizing the law that would abolish eroticism, but which only works by compelling eroticization." (Butler 103)

"If Foucault could argue that a sign could be taken up, used for purposes counter to those for which it was designed, then he understood that even the most noxious terms could be owned, that the most injurious interpellations could also be the site of radical reoccupation and resignification.  But what lets us occupy the discursive site of injury?  How are we animated and mobilized by that discursive site and its injury, such that our very attachment to it becomes the condition for our resignification of it?" (Butler 104)


4.  "Conscience Doth Make Subjects of Us All": Althusser's Subjection

"Althusser's doctrine of interpellation continues to structure contemporary debate on subject formation, offering a way to account for a subject who comes into being as a consequence of language, yet always within its terms." (Butler 106)

"Why does subject formation appear to take place only upon the acceptance of guilt, so that there is no 'I' who might ascribe a place to itself, who might be announced in speech, without first a self-attribution of guilt, a submission to the law through an acceptance of its demand for conformity?" (Butler 107)

"Although there would be no turning around without first having been hailed, neither would there be a turning around without some readiness to turn." (Butler 107)

"Indeed, the law is broken prior to any possibility of having access to the law, and so 'guilt' is prior to knowledge of the law and is, in this sense, always strangely innocent.  The possibility of a critical view of the law is thus limited by what might be understood as a prior desire for the law, a passionate complicity with the law, without which no subject can exist.  For the 'I' to launch its critique, it must first understand that the 'I' itself is dependent upon its complicitous desire for the law to make possible its own existence.  A critical review of the law will not, therefore, undo the force of conscience unless the one who offers that critique is willing, as it were, to be undone by the critique that he or she performs." (Butler 108)

"how does Althusser's sanctification of the scene of interpellation make the possibility of becoming a 'bad' subject more remote and less incendiary than it might well be?" (Butler 109)

"Althusser's own writing, he concedes, invariably enacts what it thematizes, and thus promises no enlightened escape from ideology through this articulation." (Butler 110)

"the divine power of naming structures the theory of interpellation that accounts for the ideological constitution of the subject." (Butler 110-11)

"perhaps one has already yielded before one turns around, and that turning is merely a sign of an inevitable submission by which one is established as a subject positioned in language as a possible addressee." (Butler 111)

"This turning toward the voice of the law is a sign of a certain desire to be beheld by and perhaps also to behold the face of authority, a visual rendering of an auditory scene -- a mirror stage or, perhaps more appropriately, an 'acoustic mirror' -- that permits the misrecognition without which the sociality of the subject cannot be achieved." (Butler 112)

"To the extent that Althusser's religious analogies are understood as merely illustrative, they are set apart from the rigorous argumentation of the text itself, offered in pedagogical paraphrasis.  Yet the performative force of the voice of religious authority becomes exemplary for the theory of interpellation, thus extending through example the putative force of divine naming to the social authorities by which the subject is hailed into social being." (Butler 114)

"The concern here has a more specific textual aim, namely, to show how figures -- examples and analogies -- inform and extend conceptualizations, implicating the text in an ideological sanctification of religious authority which it can expose only by reenacting that authority." (Butler 114)

"The reproduction of the subject takes place through the reproduction of linguistic skills, constituting, as it were, the rules and attitudes observed 'by every agent in the division of labor.'" (Butler 115-16)

"Language skills are said to be mastered and masterable, yet this mastery is figured by Althusser quite clearly as a kind of submission... This submission to the rules of the dominant ideology leads in the next paragraph to the problematic of *subjection*, which carries the double meaning of having submitted to these rules and becoming constituted within sociality by virtue of this submission." (Butler 116)

"The more a practice is mastered, the more fully subjection is achieved.  Submission and mastery take place simultaneously, and this paradoxical simultaneity constitutes the ambivalence of subjection." (Butler 116)

"But the reproduction of labor is not central here -- the central reproduction is one proper to the subject and takes place in relation to language and to the formation of conscience." (Butler 117-18)

"The moral sense of *s'acquitter* is lost in its translation as 'to perform': if the mastery of a set of skills is to be construed as *an acquitting of oneself*, then this mastery of *savoir-faire* defends one against an accusation; quite literally, it is the accused's declaration of innocence." (Butler 118)

"To become a 'subject' is thus to have been presumed guilty, then tried and declared innocent.  Because this declaration is not a single act but a status incessantly *reproduced*, to become a 'subject' is to be continuously in the process of acquitting oneself of the accusation of guilt." (Butler 118)

"Here one might usefully conjecture that the reason there are so few references to 'bad subjects' in Althusser is that the term tends toward the oxymoronic.  To be 'bad' is not yet to be a subject, not yet to have acquitted oneself of the allegation of guilt." (Butler 118-19)

"To master a set of skills is not simply to accept a set of skills, but to reproduce them in and as one's own activity." (Butler 119)

"The notion of ritual suggests that it is performed, and that in the repetition of performance a belief is spawned, which is then incorporated into the performance in its subsequent operations.  But inherent to any performance is a compulsion to 'acquit oneself,' and so prior to any performance is an anxiety and a knowingness which becomes articulate and animating only on the occasion of the reprimand." (Butler 119)

"The constitution of the subject is *material* to the extent that this constitution takes place through *rituals*, and these rituals materialize 'the ideas of the subject.'  What is called 'subjectivity,' understood as the lived and imaginary experience of the subject, is itself derived from the material rituals by which subjects are constituted." (Butler 121-22, quoting Althusser)

"To literalize or to ascribe and ontological status to the grammatical requirement of 'the subject' is to presume a mimetic relation between grammar and ontology which misses the point, both Althusserian and Lacanian, that the anticipations of grammar are always and only retroactively installed." (Butler 124)

"Subjectivity arises immaterially from a material ritual performance, but this can happen only on the condition that a logic precedes and supports this ritual performance, an immaterial logic, one which encodes and reenacts the idealizing effects of introjection." (Butler 126)

"That the subject turns round or rushes toward the law suggests that the subject lives in passionate expectation of the law.  Such love is not beyond interpellation; rather, it forms the passionate circle in which the subject becomes ensnared by its own state." (Butler 129)

"Interpellation is 'barred' from success not by a structurally permanent form of prohibition (or foreclosure), but by its inability to determine the constitutive field of the human.  If conscience is one form that the passionate attachment to existence takes, then the failure of interpellation is to be found precisely in the passionate attachment that also allows it to work." (Butler 129)

"Is there a possibility of being elsewhere or otherwise, without denying our complicity in the law that we oppose?  Such possibility would require a different kind of turn, one that, enabled by the law, turns away from the law, resisting its lure of identity, an agency that outruns and counters the conditions of its emergence.  Such a turn demands a willingness *not* to be -- a critical desubjectivation -- in order to expose the law as less powerful than it seems." (Butler 130)


5.  Melancholy Gender/Refused Identification

"It may at first seem strange to think of gender as a kind of melancholy, or as one of melancholy's effects.  But let us remember that in _The Ego and the Id_, Freud himself acknowledged that melancholy, the unfinished process of grieving, is central to the formation of the identifications that form the ego....  Consider in conjunction with this insight Freud's further remark that 'the ego is first and foremost a bodily ego,' not merely a surface, but 'the projection of a surface.' Further, this bodily ego assumes a gendered morphology, so that the bodily ego is also a gendered ego." (Butler 132)

"In _The Ego and the Id_, he makes room for the notion that melancholic identification may be a *prerequisite* for letting the object go.  By claiming this, he changes what it means to 'let an object go,' for there is no final breaking of the attachment.  There is, rather, the incorporation of the attachment *as* identification, where identification becomes a magical, a psychic form of preserving the object... melancholic identification permits the loss of the object in the external world precisely because it provides a way to *preserve* the object as part of the ego and, hence, to avert the loss as a complete loss." (Butler 134)

"If in melancholia a loss is refused, it is not for that reason abolished.  Internalization preserves loss in the psyche; more precisely, the internalization of loss is part of the mechanism of its refusal." (Butler 134)

"Is there a way in which *gender* identifications or, rather, identifications that become central to the formation of gender, are produced through melancholic identification?" (Butler 134-35)

"If the assumption of femininity and the assumption of masculinity proceed through the accomplishment of an always tenuous heterosexuality, we might understand the force of this accomplishment as mandating the abandonment of homosexual attachments or, perhaps more trenchantly, *preempting* the possibility of homosexual attachment, a foreclosure of possibility which produces a domain of homosexuality understood as unlivable passion and ungrievable loss." (Butler 135)

"To accept this view we must begin by presupposing that masculine and feminine are not dispositions, as Freud sometimes argues, but indeed accomplishments, ones which emerge in tandem with the achievement of heterosexuality." (Butler 135)

"the fear of homosexual desire in a woman may induce a panic that she is losing her femininity, that she is not a woman, that she is no longer a proper woman, that if she is not quite a man, she is like one, and hence monstrous in some way.  Or in a man, the terror of homosexual desire may lead to a terror of being construed as feminine, feminized, of no longer being properly a man, of being a 'failed' man, or being in some sense a figure of monstrosity or abjection" (Butler 136)

"If one is a girl to the extent that one does not want a girl, then wanting a girl will bring being a girl into question; within this matrix, homosexual desire thus panics gender." (Butler 136)

"If a man becomes heterosexual by repudiating the feminine, where could that repudiation live except in an identification which his heterosexual career seeks to deny?  Indeed the desire for the feminine is marked by that repudiation: he wants the woman he would never be.  He wouldn't be caught dead being her: therefore he wants her.  She is his repudiated identification (a repudiation he sustains as at once identification and the object of his desire). One of the most anxious aims of his desire will be to elaborate the difference between him and her, and he will seek to discover and install proof of that difference.  His wanting will be haunted by a dread of being what he wants, so that his wanting will also always be a kind of dread." (Butler 137)

"I make no empirical claims, nor attempt a survey of current psychoanalytic scholarship on gender, sexuality, or melancholy.  I want merely to suggest what I take to be some productive convergences between Freud's thinking on ungrieved and ungrievable loss and the predicament of living in a culture which can mourn the loss of homosexual attachment only with great difficulty." (Butler 138)

"Of course, it comes as no surprise that the more hyperbolic and defensive a masculine identification, the more fierce the ungrieved homosexual cathexis.  In this sense, we might understand both 'masculinity' and 'femininity' as formed and consolidated through identifications which are in part composed of disavowed grief." (Butler 139)

"What ensues is a culture of gender melancholy in which masculinity and femininity emerge as the traces of an ungrieved and ungrievable love; indeed, where masculinity and femininity within the heterosexual matrix are strengthened through the repudiations that they perform.  In opposition to a conception of sexuality which is said to 'express' a gender, gender is here understood to be composed of precisely what remains inarticulate in sexuality." (Butler 140)

"Melancholy is both the refusal of grief and the incorporation of loss, a miming of the death it cannot mourn.  Yet the incorporation of death draws upon the death instincts to such a degree that we might well wonder whether the two can be separated from one another, whether analytically or phenomenologically." (Butler 142)

"Renunciation does not abolish the instinct; it deploys the instinct for its own purposes, so that prohibition, and the lived experience of prohibition as repeated renunciation, is nourished precisely by the instinct that it renounces." (Butler 143)

"the theory of gender as performative that I elaborated in _Gender Trouble_.... There I argued that gender is performative, by which I meant that no gender is 'expressed' by actions, gestures, or speech, but that the performance of gender produces retroactively the illusion that there is an inner gender core." (Butler 144)

"Clearly there are workings of gender that do not 'show' in what is performed as gender, and to reduce the psychic workings of gender to the literal performance of gender would be a mistake" (Butler 144)

"drag imitates the imitative structure of gender, revealing gender itself to be an imitation" (Butler 145)

"given the iconographic figure of the melancholic drag queen, one might ask whether there is not a dissatisfied longing in the mimetic incorporation of gender that is drag." (Butler 145)

"This is, then, neither a territorialization of the feminine by the masculine nor a sign of the essential plasticity of gender.  It suggests that the performance allegorizes a loss it cannot grieve, allegorizes the incorporative fantasy of melancholia whereby an object is phantasmatically taken in or on as a way of refusing to let it go.  Gender itself might be understood in part as the 'acting out' of unresolved grief." (Butler 145-46)

"What does seem useful in this analysis, however, is that drag exposes or allegorizes the mundane psychic and performative practices by which heterosexualized genders form themselves through renouncing the *possibility* of homosexuality, a foreclosure which produces both a field of heterosexual objects and a domain of those whom it would be impossible to love.  Drag thus allegorizes *heterosexual melancholy*, the melancholy by which a masculine gender is formed from the refusal to grieve the masculine as a possibility of love; a feminine gender is formed (taken on, assumed) through the incorporative fantasy by which the feminine is excluded as a possible object of love, an exclusion never grieved, but 'preserved' through heightened feminine identification.  In this sense the 'truest' lesbian melancholic is the strictly straight woman, and the 'truest' gay male melancholic is the strictly straight man." (Butler 146-47)

"Gay melancholia, however, also contains anger that can be translated into political action." (Butler 147)

"Insofar as the grief remains unspeakable, the rage over the loss can redouble by virtue of remaining unavowed.  And if that rage is publically proscribed, the melancholic effects of such a proscription can achieve suicidal proportions." (Butler 148)

"For a gay or lesbian identity position to sustain its appearance as coherent, heterosexuality must remain in that rejected and repudiated place.  Paradoxically, its heterosexual *remains* must be *sustained* precisely through insisting on the seamless coherence of a specifically gay identity.  Here it should become clear that a radical refusal to identify suggests that on some level an identification has already taken place, an identification has been made and disavowed, whose symptomatic appearance is the insistence, the overdetermination of the identification that is, as it were, worn on the body that shows." (Butler 149)

"Perhaps only by risking the *incoherence* of identity is connection possible, a political point that correlates with Leo Bersani's insight that only the decentered subject is available to desire." (Butler 149)

-- "Keeping It Moving: Commentary on Judith Butler's 'Melancholy Gender/Refused Identification'" -- Adam Phillips (151-59)

"As Judith Butler's sobering essay shows, this critical concept of identificataion is the nexus for a number of contentious issues in contemporary theory; it invites us to wonder what we use other people for and how other they are... in what sense do we have what we prefer to call relationships with each other?" (Phillips 152)

"When Freud proposed that the object was merely 'soldered' onto the instinct, that our primary commitment was to our desire and not to its target, he implied that we are not attached to each other in the ways we like to think." (Phillips 152)

"Mourning is immensely reassuring because it convinces us of something we might otherwise doubt; our attachment to others." (Phillips 153)

"It is as though a capacity for mourning, with all that it implies, constitutes the human community.  We can no more imagine a world without bereavement than we can imagine a world without punishment." (Phillips 153)

"At the least, it seems clear from Butler's convincing account that the culturally pervasive hostility -- both inter- and intrapsychically -- to homosexuality is based on envy.... But if, as Butler suggests, 'masculinity' and 'femininity' are formed and consolidated through identifications that are composed in part of disavowed grief, what would it be like to live in a world that acknowledged and sanctioned such grief, that allowed us, as it were, the full course of our bereavement of disowned or renounced gender identities?" (Phillips 154)

"Butler's use of identification puts the notion of the performative back into the analytical frame; what is more surprising is that she has been able to use mourning as a way of nuancing the theatricality that is integral to our making of identities, our making ourselves up through loss." (Phillips 157)

"There is a kind of intellectual melancholy in the loss of a third sex that never existed and so can never by mourned; this third, irrational sex that would break the spell (or the logic) of the two, and that is one of the child's formative and repressed fantasies about himself or herself." (Phillips 158)

-- Reply to Adam Phillips's commentary on "Melancholy Gender/Refused Identification"

"My reply will focus first on the question of whether melancholy is rightly understood to oppose or to temper notions of gender performativity, and second, on whether sexual difference is an opposition that is as stable as it might appear." (Butler 160-61)

"what is performed as a consequence of melancholia is not a voluntary act, but an acting out motivated -- in part -- by an unowned aggression." (Butler 162)

"the notion of gender performativity calls for psychoanalytic rethinking through the notion of 'acting out,' as it emerges in the articulation of melancholia and in the pantomimic response to loss whereby the lost other is incorporated in the formative identifications of the ego." (Butler 162)

"But what breaks the hold of grief except the cultivation of the aggression grief holds at bay against the means by which it is held at bay?  Part of what sustains and extends the period of mourning is precisely the prohibition against expressing aggression toward what is lost" (Butler 162-63)

"Perhaps the economy of desire always works through refusal and loss of some kind, but it is not as a consequence an economy structured by a logic of non-contradiction." (Butler 164)

"Does it follow that if one desires a woman, one is desiring from a masculine disposition, or is that disposition retroactively attributed to the desiring position as a ways of retaining heterosexuality as the way of understanding the separateness or alterity that conditions desire?" (Butler 165)


6.  Psychic Inceptions:  Melancholy, Ambivalence, Rage

"The social world appears to be eclipsed in melancholy, and an internal world structured in ambivalence emerges as a consequence." (Butler 167)

"the account of melancholy is an account of how psychic and social domains are produced in relation to one another.  As such, melancholy offers potential insight into how the boundaries of the social are instituted and maintained, not only at the expense of psycic life, but through binding psychic life into forms of melancholic ambivalence." (Butler 167-68)

"The turn from the object to the ego produces the ego, which substitutes for the object lose.  This production is a tropological generation and follows from the psychic compulsion to substitute for objects lost." (Butler 168-69)

"The ego is a poor substitute for the lost object, and its failure to substitute in a way that satisfies (that is, to overcome its status *as* a substitution), leads to the ambivalence that distinguishes melancholia." (Butler 169)

"Does the same ego turn its investment from the object to itself, or is the ego fundamentally altered by virtue of becoming the object of such a turn?" (Butler 169)

"melancholy is precisely what interiorizes the psyche, that is, makes it possible to refer to the psyche through such topographical tropes.  The turn from object to ego is the movement that makes the distinction between them possible, that marks the division, the separation or loss, that forms the ego to begin with." (Butler 170)

"In what follows, I hope to clarify how melancholia involves the production of an internal world as well as a topographical set of fictions that structures the psyche... melancholia initiates a variable boundary between the psychic and the social, a boundary, I hope to show, that distributes and regulates the psychic sphere in relation to prevailing norms of social regulation." (Butler 171)

"Melancholia produces a set of spatializing tropes for psychic life, domiciles of preservation and shelter as well as arenas for struggle and persecution.  Such tropes do not 'explain' melancholia: they constitute some of its fabular discursive effects." (Butler 171)

"Although the ego is said to be the point of departure for a libido that is subsequently withdrawn into the ego, it now appears that only upon such a withdrawal can the ego emerge as an object for consciousness, something that might be represented at all, whether as a point of departure or a site of return." (Butler 177)

"Clearly playing on a metaphor of a socially constructed domain of power, Freud's reference to conscience as 'among the major institutions of the ego [*Ichinstitutionen*]' (247) suggests not only that conscience is instituted, produced, and maintained within a larger polity and its organization, but that the ego and its various parts are accessible through a metaphorical language that attributes a social content and structure to these presumably psychic phenomena." (Butler 178)

"The effect of melancholia, then, appears to be the loss of the social world, the substitution of psychic parts and antagonisms for external relations among social actors" (Butler 179)

"The ego is 'altered by identification,' that is, altered by virtue of absorbing the object or pulling back its own cathexis onto itself.  The 'price' of such an identification, however, is that the ego splits into the critical agency and the ego as object of criticism and judgment.... The ego now stands for the object, and the critical agency comes to represent the ego's disowned rage, reified as a psychic agency separate from the ego itself." (Butler 180)

"The self-reproaches of the ego are not simply the imitation of reproaches once leveled against the ego from the one lost, as is commonly assumed; rather, they are reproaches levels against the other that now turn back upon the ego." (Butler 181)

"One *would have* denounced the lost other if one could -- for departing, if for no other reason.  Fulfilling a wish whose form, the past subjunctive, precludes any such fulfillment, the melancholic seeks not only to reverse time, reinstating the imaginary past as the present, but to occupy every position and thereby to preclude the loss of the addressee.  The melancholic would have *said something*, if he or she could, but did not, and now believes in the sustaining power of the voice."  (Butler 182)

"forms of social power emerge that regulate what losses will and will not be grieved; in the social foreclosure of grief we might find what fuels the internal violence of conscience." (Butler 183)

"Is the psychic violence of conscience not a refracted indictment of the social forms that have made certain kinds of losses ungrievable?" (Butler 185)

"What cannot be declared by the melancholic is nevertheless what governs melancholic speech -- an unspeakability that organizes the field of the speakable." (Butler 186)

"But one can discern in this formulation the beginnings of reflection on a drive that might be said to counter the pleasure principle, what is later referred to as the death drive." (Butler 187)

"to refuse a loss is to become it.  If the ego cannot accept the loss of the other, then the loss that the other comes to represent becomes the loss that now characterizes the ego:  the ego becomes poor and impoverished." (Butler 187)

"This is not to suggest that conscience is a simple instantiation of the state; on the contrary, it is the vanishing point of the state's authority, its psychic idealization, and, in that sense, its disappearance into an external object.  The process of forming the subject is a process of rendering the terrorizing power of the state invisible -- and effective -- as the ideality of conscience." (Butler 191)

"Survival, not precisely the opposite of melancholia, but what melancholia puts into suspension -- requires redirecting rage against the lost other, defiling the sanctity of the dead for the purposes of life, raging against the dead in order not to join them." (Butler 193)

"Although in 1917 Freud does not yet distinguish between the pleasure principle and the death drive, he does note that melancholy has the power to force the ego into death.  By 1923, he explicitly claims that conscience, as it functions in melancholia, is 'a gathering place' for the death drives." (Butler 194)

"The 'death drive' is thus paradoxically necessary for survival; in mourning, the breaking of attachment inaugurates life.  But this 'break' is never final or full." (Butler 194)

"Survival does not take place because an autonomous ego exercises autonomy in confrontation with a countervailing world; on the contrary, no ego can emerge except through animating reference to such a world... the subject who might grieve is implicated in a loss of autonomy that is mandated by linguistic and social life; it can never produce itself autonomously."

"The social terms which make survival possible, which interpellate social existence, never reflect the autonomy of the one who comes to recognize him- or herself in them and, thus, stands a chance 'to be' within language.  Indeed by forfeiting that notion of autonomy survival becomes possible; the 'ego' is released from its melancholic foreclosure of the social." (Butler 196)

"the 'other' may be an ideal, a country, a concept of liberty, in which the loss of such ideals is compensated by the interiorized ideality of conscience.  An other or an ideal may be 'lost' by being rendered unspeakable, that is, lost through prohibition or foreclosure: unspeakable, impossible to declare, but emerging in the indirection of complaint and the heightened judgments of conscience." (Butler 196)

"To claim life in such circumstances is to contest the righteous psyche, not by an act of will, but by submission to a sociality and linguistic life that makes such acts possible, one that exceeds the bounds of the ego and its 'autonomy.' To persist in one's being means to be given over from the start to social terms that are never fully one's own.  Those terms institute a linguistic life of the 'one' who speaks prior to any act of agency, and they remain both irreducible to the one who speaks and the necessary conditions of such speech.  In this sense, interpellation works by failing, that is, it institutes its subject as an agent precisely to the extent that it fails to determine such a subject exhaustively in time." (Butler 197)

"Social discourse wields the power to form and regulate a subject through the imposition of its own terms.  Those terms, however, are not simply accepted or internalized; they become psychic only through the movement by which they are dissimulated and 'turned'.... The speech acts of power -- the declaration of guilt, the judgment of worthlessness, the verdicts of reality -- are topographically rendered as psychic instruments and institutions within a psychic landscape that depends on its metaphoricity for its plausibility." (Butler 197)

"Some psychoanalytic theorists of the social have argued that social interpellation always produces a psychic excess it cannot control.  Yet the production of the psychic as a distinct domain cannot obliterate the social occasion of this production.  The 'institution' of the ego cannot fully overcome its social residue, given that its 'voice' is from the start borrowed from elsewhere, a recasting of a social 'plaint' as psychic self-judgment." (Butler 198)
