Lippmann, Walter.  Public Opinion.  New York: Macmillan, 1965.


PART 1: INTRODUCTION

CHAPTER 1.  THE WORLD OUTSIDE AND THE PICTURES IN OUR HEADS

indirect nature of our knowledge of the world around us — like Plato and the cave

“The only feeling that anyone can have about an event that he does not experience is the feeling aroused by his mental image of that event.” (Lippmann 9)

“For it is clear enough that under certain conditions men respond as powerfully to fictions as they do to realities, and that in many cases they help to create the very fictions to which they respond.” (Lippmann 10)

“The analyst of public opinion must begin, then, by recognizing the triangular relationship between the scene of action, the human picture of that scene, and the human response to that picture working itself out upon the scene of action.” (Lippmann 11)

“the world-wide spectacle of men acting upon their environment, moved by stimuli from their pseudo-environments” (Lippmann 13)

“I argue that representative government, either in what is ordinarily called politics, or in industry, cannot be worked successfully, no matter what the basis of election, unless there is an independent, expert organization for making the unseen facts intelligible to those who have to make the decisions.” (Lippmann 19)

“My conclusion is that public opinions must be organized for the press if they are to be sound, not by the press as is the case today.” (Lippmann 19)


PART 2: APPROACHES TO THE WORLD OUTSIDE

CHAPTER 2. CENSORSHIP AND PRIVACY

limitations on producing accurate pictures of the world

propaganda, censorship, privacy

CHAPTER 3. CONTACT AND OPPORTUNITY

opportunities for communication; social set, etc.

CHAPTER 4. TIME AND ATTENTION

amount of time given to news reading

CHAPTER 5. SPEED, WORDS, AND CLEARNESS

translation of world into words; coding

“Thus the environment with which our public opinions deal is refracted in many ways, by censorship and privacy at the source, by physical and social  barriers at the other end, by scanty attention, by the poverty of language, by distraction, by unconscious constellations of feeling, by wear and tear, violence, monotony.” (Lippmann 48-49)


PART 3: STEREOTYPES

CHAPTER 6. STEREOTYPES

“In the great blooming, bussing confustion of the outer world we pick out what our culture has already defined for us, and we tend to perceive that which we have picked out in the form stereotyped for us by our culture.” (Lippmann 55)

“Photographs have the kind of authority over imagination today, which the printed word had yesterday, and the spoken word before that.” (Lippmann 61)

CHAPTER 7. STEREOTYPES AS DEFENSE

“The systems of stereotypes may be the core of our personal tradition, the defenses of our position in society. . . . No wonder, then, that any disturbance of the stereotypes seems like an attack upon the foundations of the universe.” (Lippmann 63)

CHAPTER 8. BLIND SPOTS AND THEIR VALUE

“Our stereotyped world is not necessarily the world we should like it to be.  It is simply the kind of world we expect it to be.” (Lippmann 69)

“Consequently the stereotype not only saves time in a busy life and is a defense of our position in society, but tends to preserve us from all the bewildering effect of trying to see the world steadily and see it whole.” (Lippmann 75)

CHAPTER 9. CODES AND THEIR ENEMIES

“At the core of every moral code there is a picture of human nature, a map of the universe, and a version of history.” (Lippmann 80)

“What a myth never contains is the critical power to separate its truths from its errors.  For that power comes only by realizing that no human opinion, whatever its supposed origin, is too exalted for the test of evidence, that every opinion is only somebody’s opinion.” (Lippmann 80-81)

“The orthodox theory holds that a public opinion constitutes a moral judgement on a group of facts.  The theory I am suggesting is that, in the present state of education, a public opinion is primarily a moralized and codified version of the facts.” (Lippmann 81-82)

CHAPTER 10. THE DETECTION OF STEREOTYPES

stereotypical conceptions of space and time


PART 4: INTERESTS

CHAPTER 11. THE ENLISTING OF INTEREST

“The deepest of all stereotypes is the human stereotype which imputes human nature to inanimate or collective things.” (Lippmann 103)

“Pictures have always been the surest way of conveying an idea, and next in order, words that call up pictures in memory.  But the idea conveyed is not fully our own until we have identified ourselves with some aspect of the picture.” (Lippmann 105)

CHAPTER 12. SELF-INTEREST RECONSIDERED

“He does not take his personal problems as partial samples of the greater environment.  He takes his stories of the greater environment as a mimic enlargement of his private life.” (Lippmann 111)

multiplicity of selves; multiplicity of self-interest; self-interest not determined

“The ordinary doctrine of self-interest usually omits altogether the cognitive function.  So insistent is it on the fact that human beings finally refer all things to themselves, that it does not stop to notice that men’s ideal of all things and of themselves are not instinctive.  They are acquired.” (Lippmann 116)


PART 5: THE MAKING OF A COMMON WILL

CHAPTER 13. THE TRANSFER OF INTEREST

how is a common will built?  “Where superficial harmony is the aim and conflict the fact, obscurantism in a public appeal is the usual result.  Almost always vagueness at a crucial point in public debate is a symptom of cross-purposes.” (Lippmann 130-31)

“As you ascend the hierarchy in order to include more and more factions you may for a time presere the emotional connection though you lose the intellectual.  But even the emotion becomes thinner. As you go further away from experience, you go higher into generalization or subtlety.  As you go upin the balloon you throw more and more concrete objects overboard, and when you have reached the top with some phrase like the Rights of Humanity or the World Made Safe for Democracy, you see far and wide, but you see very little.” (Lippmann 138)

CHAPTER 14. YES OR NO

political machines necessary because of inability of masses to do more than agree and disagree; “The limit of direct action is for all practical purposes the power to say Yes or No on an issue presented to the mass.” (Lippmann 147)

“The Many can elect after the Few have nominated.” (Lippmann 149)

CHAPTER 15. LEADERS AND THE RANK AND FILE

symbols used by leaders to organize following:  “Because of its power to siphon emotion out of distinct ideas, the symbol is both a mechanism of solidarity, and a mechanism of exploitation.” (Lippmann 151)

“where masses of people must cooperate in an  uncertain and eruptive environment, it is usually necessary to secure unity and flexibility without real consent.  The symbol does that.  It obscures personal intention, neutralizes discrimination, and obfuscates individual purpose.” (Lippmann 153)

“the mass is constantly exposed to suggestion.  It reads not the news, but the news with an aura of suggestion about it, indicating the line of action to be taken.  It hears reports, not objective as the facts are, but already stereotyped to a certain pattern of behavior.  Thus the ostensible leader often finds that the real leader is a powerful newspaper proprietor.” (Lippmann 155)

“the manufacture of consent” (Lippmann 158) — see Chomsky


PART 6: THE IMAGE OF DEMOCRACY

CHAPTER 16. THE SELF-CENTERED MAN

“It would have been visionary to suppose that a time would come when distant and complicated events could conceivably be reported, analyzed, and presented in sucha form that a really valuable choice could be made by an amateur.  That time is now in sight.” (Lippmann 166)

how can the self-centered man be made to see the whole world?

CHAPTER 17. THE SELF-CONTAINED COMMUNITY

development of Jefferson’s democratic ideal into political gospel and stereotype; contacts outside the self-contained group as threat to democracy

“This meant that men formed their picture of the world outside from the unchallenged pictures in their heads.” (Lippmann 173)

CHAPTER 18. THE ROLE OF FORCE, PATRONAGE, AND PRIVILEGE

“In one very important sense, then, the doctrine of checks and balances was the remedy of the federalist leaders for the problem of public opinion.” (Lippmann 177)

“The American people came to believe that their Constitution was a democratic instrument, and treated it as such.  They owe that fiction to the victory of Thomas Jefferson, and a great conservative fiction it has been.” (Lippmann 179)

CHAPTER 19. THE OLD IMAGE IN A NEW FORM: GUILD SOCIALISM

CHAPTER 20. A NEW IMAGE

“In the absence of institutions and education by which the environment is so successfully reported that the realities of public life stand out sharply against self-centered opinion, the common interests very largely elude public opinion entirely, and can be managed only by a specialized class whose personal interests reach beyond the locality.” (Lippmann 195)

[this supposes that there is some such thing as a reporting of the facts outside interest, and that someone could ever be qualified to do such reporting — sees escaping ideology as a possibility — and awfully paternalistic]

“The only prospect which is not visionary is that each of us in his own sphere will act more and more on a realistic picture of the invisible world, and that we shall develop more and more men who are expert in keeping these pictures realistic.” (Lippmann 197)


PART 7: NEWSPAPERS

CHAPTER 21. THE BUYING PUBLIC

public as newspaper audience; necessity for newspapers of not angering the public

CHAPTER 22. THE CONSTANT READER

“What better criterion does the man at the breakfast table possess than that the newspaper version checks up with his own opinion?” (Lippmann 208)

CHAPTER 23. THE NATURE OF NEWS

“The course of events must assume a certain definable shape, and until it is in a phase where some aspect is an accomplished fact, news does not separate itself from the ocean of possible truth.” (Lippmann 215)

rise of the press agent: “The development of the publicity man is a clear sign that the facts of modern life do not spontaneously take a shape in which they can be known.  They must be given a shape by somebody, and since in the daily routine reporters cannot give a shape to facts, and since there is little disinterested organization of intelligence, the need for some formulation is being met by the interested parties.” (Lippmann 218)

CHAPTER 24. NEWS, TRUTH, AND A CONCLUSION

“The hypothesis, which seems to me the most fertile, is that news and truth are not the same thing, and must be clearly distinguished.  The function of news is to signalize an event, the function of truth is to bring to light the hidden facts, to set them into relation with each other, and make a picture of reality on which men can act.” (Lippmann 226)


PART 8: ORGANIZED INTELLIGENCE

CHAPTER 25. THE ENTERING WEDGE

CHAPTER 26. INTELLIGENCE WORK
