Chartier, Roger. The Order of Books: Readers, Authors, and Libraries in Europe Between the Fourteenth and Eighteenth Centuries. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1994.

Preface

"how did people in Western Europe between the end of the Middle Ages and the eighteenth century attempt to master the enormously increased number of texts that first the manuscript book and then print put into circulation?  Inventorying titles, categorizing works, and attributing texts were all operations that made it possible to set the world of the written word in order." (Chartier vii)

"The invention of the author as the fundamental principle for the designation of a text, the dream of a universal library, real or imaginary, containing all the works that have ever been written, and the emergence of a new definition of the book that made an indissoluble connection between and object, a text, and an author -- these are some of the innovations that transformed people's relationship with texts, both before and after Gutenberg." (Chartier vii-viii)

"On the one hand, every reader has to deal with an entire set of constraints and obligations.... On the other hand, reading, by definition, is rebellious and vagabond." (Chartier viii)

"The book always aims at installing an order, whether it is the order in which it is deciphered, the order in which it is to be understood, or the order intended by the authority who commanded or permitted the work." (Chartier viii)

"keen attention should be paid to the technical, visual, and physical devices that organize the reading of writing when writing becomes a book." (Chartier ix)

"Works are produced within a specific order that has its own rules, conventions, and hierarchies, but they escape all these and take on a certain density in their peregrinations -- which can be in a very long time span -- about the social world... works turn the tables and become a precious resource for thinking about what is essential: the construction of social ties, individual subjectivity, and relationship with the sacred." (Chartier x)
"To consider in this way that all works are anchored in the practices and the institutions of the social world is not to postulate any general equivalence among all the products of the mind." (Chartier x)

1 Communities of Readers

contrast between "writing -- conservative, fixed, durable -- and reading -- always of the order of the ephemeral" (Chartier 1)
"a dual presupposition:  that reading is not already inscribed in the text with no conceivable gap between the meaning assigned to it (by its author, by custom, by criticism, and so forth) and the interpretation that is readers might make of it; and, as a corollary, that a text exists only because there is a reader to give it meaning." (Chartier 2)

"The historian's task is thus to reconstruct the variations that differentiate the *espaces lisibles* -- that is, the texts in their discursive and material forms -- and those that govern the circumstances of their *effectuation* -- that is, the readings, understood as concrete practices and as procedures of interpretation." (Chartier 2)

"three poles that the academic tradition usually keeps separate:  first, the analysis of texts, be they canonical or ordinary, to discern their structures, their themes, and their aims; second, the history of books and, beyond that, the history of all objects and all forms that bear texts; third, the study of practices that seize on these objects and these forms in a variety of ways and produce differentiated uses and meanings." (Chartier 2-3)

"how did increased circulation of printed matter transform forms of sociability, permit new modes of thought, and change people's relationship with power?" (Chartier 3)

"one must state that forms produce meaning and that a text, stable in its letter, is invested with a new meaning and status when the mechanisms that make it available to interpretation change." (Chartier 3)

"reading is always a practice embodied in acts, spaces, and habits." (Chartier 3)

"a history of reading must identify the specific mechanisms that distinguish the various communities of readers and traditions of reading." (Chartier 4)

"All who can read texts do not read them in the same fashion, and there is an enormous gap between the virtuosi among readers and the least skilled at reading, who have to oralize what they are reading in order to comprehend it and who are at ease only with a limited range of textual or typographical forms.  There are equally great differences between the norms and conventions of reading that define, for each community of readers, legitimate uses of the book, ways to read, and the instruments and methods of interpretations.  Finally, there are differences between the expectations and interests that various groups of readers invest in the practice of reading." (Chartier 4)

"the history of reading must be radically distinguished from a history of what is read" (Chartier 5)

"Cultural divisions are not obligatorily organized in accordance with the one grid of social divisions that supposedly commands the unequal presence of objects or differences in behaviour patterns." (Chartier 7)

"What is essential is thus to understand how the same texts can be differently apprehended, manipulated, and comprehended." (Chartier 8)

"A second shift of emphasis reconstructs networks of practices that organized historically and socially differentiated modes of access of texts... special attention should be paid to ways of reading that have disappeared in our contemporary world.  One of these is reading aloud in its dual function of communicating the written word to those who are unable to decipher it themselves but also of cementing the interlocking forms of sociability that are emblematic of private life in the intimacy of the family circle, in worldly conviviality, and in literary circles and spheres of scholarly sociability." (Chartier 8)

"we need to make a distinction between two sets of mechanisms, the ones that are part of the strategies of writing and the author's intentions, and the ones that result from publishing decisions or the constraints of the print shop." (Chartier 9)

"The space between text and object, which is precisely the space in which meaning is constructed, has too often been forgotten" (Chartier 10)

"Variations in the most purely formal aspects of a text's presentation can thus modify both its register of reference and its mode of interpretation." (Chartier 11)

"identification of sociocultural differentiations and a study of formal and material mechanisms, far from being mutually exclusive, are necessarily connected." (Chartier 14)

"It is perhaps time to question three of these fundamental cleavages, which are held to be certain.  First, the opposition between a reading in which comprehension depends upon oralization, either out loud or mumbled, and another, possibly visual reading.... The second accepted cleavage falls between an 'intensive,' reverential, and respectful reading of a small number of books that relies on hearing and memory and an 'extensive' reading that consumes many texts, passes nonchalantly from one text to the next, and holds less sacred what is read.  The third cleavage is between a private, cloistered, solitary reading, considered to be one of the essential elements for constituting a sphere of private life, and the collective reading -- both disciplined and rebellious, of communitarian spaces." (Chartier 17)

"three sets of transformations whose effects have often been imperfectly untangled:  'revolutions' that have taken place in techniques for the reproduction of texts (first among them, a shift from 'scribal culture' to 'print culture'); changes in the very forms of the book (the change from the roll or *volumen* to the book in signatures or *codex* during the early centuries of the Christian era was the most fundamental of these but other and less sweeping changes modified the visual aspect of the printed page between the sixteenth and eighteenth century); wide-scale change in reading skills and in modes of reading.... The most interesting question posted to and by the history of reading today is certainly that of the ways in which these three sets of mutations -- technological, formal, and cultural -- related to one another." (Chartier 18)

"access to print cannot be reduced to book ownership alone: every book that is read is not necessarily a book that is personally owned, and all printed matter kept in the home is not obligatorily a book." (Chartier 19)

"it is certain that many practices reversed the very terms of the opposition that has so often been depicted between solitary reading in the privacy of a bourgeois or aristocratic setting and reading in common among popular listeners.  In reality, reading aloud while others listened remained one of the practices that cemented elite sociability; conversely, printed matter penetrated to the very heart of the humble home, where it imbued modest objects that were by no means always books with traces of an important moment in private life, a memory of an emotion, or a sign of identity." (Chartier 22)

"two propositions of Michel de Certeau.  The first recalls, against all reductive attempts to deny the creative and inventive force of practice, that reading is never totally constraint and that it cannot be deduced from the texts it makes use of.  The second stresses that readers' tactics, insinuated in the *lieu propre* (place of their own) produced by the strategies of writing, obey rules, follow logical systems, and imitate models." (Chartier 23)

2  Figures of the Author

"D. F. McKenzie has stressed the fundamental kinship between bibliography (in its classic definition of a study of the physical aspects of the book) and all forms of structuralist criticism... For both the New Criticism and analytical bibliography, the production of meaning relied on the automatic and impersonal operation of a system of signs -- either the system instituting the language of the text or the one organizing the form of the printed object." (Chartier 25)

"In this perspective, dominant in the English-speaking world... the history of the book was thus a history with neither readers nor authors." (Chartier 25-26)

"In the tradition of the social history of print as it has developed in France, books have readers but they do not have authors" (Chartier 26-27)

return of the author in reception theory and the New Historicism

"The 'aesthetic of reception' aimed at describing the dialogue between an individual work and its readers' 'horizon of expectations,' defined as the set of conventions and references shared by the work's public or publics." (Chartier 27)

"The New Historicism is more interested in situating the literary work in relation to 'ordinary' texts (of a practical, juridical, political, or religious nature) that constitute the raw materials on which writing operates and that make its intelligibility possible." (Chartier 27)

"This is of course not a restoration of the superb and solitary romantic figure of the sovereign author whose primary or final intention contains *the* meaning of the work and whose biography commands its writing with transparent immediacy.  As he returns in literary criticism or literary sociology the author is both dependent and constrained." (Chartier 28)

"He is constrained in that he undergoes the multiple determinations that organize the social space of literary production and that, in a more general sense, determine the categories and the experiences that are the very matrices of writing." (Chartier 28-29)

Foucault and the author-function:  "a dual process of selection.  First, the texts assignable to the author-function must be separated from the many texts that an individual may produce... Second, one must pick from among the innumerable events that constitute a biography and must retain the facts pertinent to a definition of the author's position." (Chartier 29-30)

"This strong connection between the individuality of the author and the inscription of the activity of writing and publishing within the regime of private property is not, however, the founding principle of the author-function.  The function is older and rooted in other determinations" (Chartier 30)

"for certain classes of texts, reference to the author was functional as early as the Middle Ages" (Chartier 31)

"By moving the figure of the author back in time and by articulating it with mechanisms for controlling the circulation of texts or for lending them authority, Foucault's essay invites us to a retrospective investigation that gives the history of the conditions of the production, dissemination, and appropriation of texts particular pertinence." (Chartier 32)

"The first major revision suggested that the affirmation of literary authorship, far from arising from a particular application of a modern individual property law, derived directly from the book trade's defence of permissions to print -- authorizations that granted exclusive rights to a work to the bookseller who had obtained title to it." (Chartier 32) -- authorship thus established not to support author's property rights but those of the printer

"When authors shifted from the patronage system (where retribution for their writing usually preceded the act of writing in the form of a sinecure or followed it in the form of gratifications) to operate in the market, where immediate and monetary profit was expected from the sale of a manuscript to a bookseller (or, for a dramatist, from a percentage of the proceeds of performances of his plays), this shift was accompanied by an apparently contradictory change in the ideology of writing, henceforth defined by the urgency and absolute freedom of creative power." (Chartier 37)

"A radical reversal different from the one discussed by Foucault thus seems to have occurred during the latter half of the eighteenth century.  Before, the author's subjection to obligations created by client relations and patronage ties was accompanied by a radical incommensurability between literary works and economic transactions.  After the mid-century the situation was reversed when a possible and necessary monetary appreciation of literary compositions, remunerated as labour and subject to the laws of the market, was founded on an ideology of creative and disinterested genius that guaranteed the originality of the work." (Chartier 38)

"In the traditional definition, the author lived not by the pen but from investments and landholdings or public office; he scorned print and expressed an aristocratic 'antipathy to a medium that perverted the primary courtly literary values of privacy and rarity'; he preferred the chosen public of his peers, manuscript circulation for his works, and concealment of his name in an anonymous work.... The new economics of writing supposed the full visibility of the author, the original creator of a work from which he could legitimately expect to profit." (Chartier 39)

"For these two dictionaries of the late seventeenth century, the term 'author' is not to be applied to anyone who writes a work; the term distinguishes among all 'writers' only those who have cared to have their compositions published." (Chartier 41)

"Since the emergence of the author-function is less directly connected to the definition of the concept of literary property than might be thought, must it then be attached to 'penal appropriation' of discourses?  To the writer's judicial responsibility?" (Chartier 48-49)

"In the repression of suspect books, however, the responsibility of the author of a censured book does not seem to have been considered any greater than that of the printer who published it, the bookseller or the pedlar who sold it, or the reader who possessed it." (Chartier 50)

"In connection with church or state censorship as in its association with literary property, the author-function is fully inscribed within the culture of print.  In both cases it appears to derive from fundamental transformations brought by printing: it was printing that extended, hence that made more dangerous, the circulation of texts that defied authority, and printing created a market that presupposed the establishment of rules and conventions among all who profited from it, economically or symbolically, the writer, the bookseller-publisher, and the printer.  But was this really the case?" (Chartier 51) -- hint: no

the function of the portrait of the author in a text "is to reinforce the notion that the writing is the expression of an individuality that gives authenticity to the work" (Chartier 52)

images of the author in the act of writing "broke with time-honored conventions in representations of the process of writing, both the convention that equated writing with listening to a dictated text and copying it... and the convention that thought of writing as a simple continuation of an existing work" (Chartier 52)

"... an 'author,' however, who was long understood as someone whose social position could lend 'authority' to intellectual discourse" (Chartier 59)

"It would be a mistake to reduce the construction of an author-function, understood as the major criterion for the attribution of texts, to oversimplified or too-univocal formulas." (Chartier 59)

3  Libraries without Walls

"The dream of a library (in a variety of configurations) that would bring together all accumulated knowledge and all the books ever written can be found throughout the history of Western civilization." (Chartier 62) -- but of course the task is impossible definitions of "bibliotheque" in middle French include the place, the collection of works it contains, and, most importantly, the catalog of works

"A 'library' is not only the inventory of books assembled in a specific place; it can be an inventory of all the books ever written on a given subject or by all the authors of a given nation." (Chartier 70)

"A universal library (or at least universal in one order of knowledge) could not be other than fictive, reduced to the dimensions of a catalogue, a nomenclature, or a survey.  Conversely, any library that is actually installed in a specific place and that is made up of real works available for consultation and reading, no matter how rich it might be, gives only a truncated image of all accumulable knowledge.  The irreducible gap between ideally exhaustive inventories and necessarily incomplete collections was experienced with intense frustration." (Chartier 88)

Epilogue

"The library of the future is inscribed where all texts can be summoned, assembled, and read: on a screen.  In the universe of remote communications made possible by computerized texts and electronic diffusion, texts are no longer prisoners of their original physical, material existence." (Chartier 89)

"If texts are emancipated form the form that has conveyed them since the first centuries of the Christian era -- the *codex*, the book composed of quires from which all printed objects with which we are familiar derive -- by the same token all intellectual technologies and all the operations at work in the production of meaning will be modified.  'Forms effect meanings,' D. F. McKenzie reminds us, and his less, which should be taken to heart, warns us to be on guard against the illusion that wrongly reduces texts to their semantic content.  When it passes from the *codex* to the monitor screen the 'same' text is no longer truly the same because new formal devices that offer it to its reader  modify the conditions of its reception and its comprehension." (Chartier 90)

"When the text is carried by a new technique and embodied in a new physical form, it can be offered to manipulation by a reader who is no longer limited, as with the printed book, to adding hand-written matter in the spaces left blank in typographic composition and in binding.  At the same time, the end of the *codex* will signify the loss of acts adn representations indissolubly linked to the book as we now know it." (Chartier 90)

"The historian's musings proposed in the present work thus lead to a question essential in our own present time -- not the overworked question of the supposed disappearance of writing, which is more resistant than has been thought, but the question of a possible revolution in the forms of its dissemination and appropriation." (Chartier 91)
