Donaldson, Ian.Â  "The Destruction of the Book." Book History 1.1 (1998): 1-10.


"As Robin Alston has recently reminded us, however, there are still many tricks that electronic technology is quite incapable of performing; still many structural, practical, and interpretative problems embedded in the new systems; still many radical and continuing limitations on the supposed electronic management of knowledge." (Donaldson 2, citing Robin C. Alston, "Books and Electronics," in The Politics of the Electronic Text, ed. Warren Chernaik, Caroline David, and Marilyn Deegan (London: The Centre for English Studies, University of London, 1993), 81-90)

"The precariousness of a literature based entirely upon oral tradition or manuscript form is self-evident. With the invention of the printing press capable of mass production, one might expect this anxiety about the destructibility of the book to recede, but the reverse is true: the topos takes on new range and vigor." (Donaldson 6)
