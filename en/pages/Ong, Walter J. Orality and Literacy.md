Ong, Walter J. Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word. London: Routledge, 2002.


Introduction

"Many of the features we have taken for granted in thought and expression in literature, philosophy and science, and even in oral discourse among literates, are not directly native to human existence as such but have come into being because of the resources which the technology of writing makes available to human consciousness" (Ong 1)

"Diachronic study of orality and literacy and of the various stages in the evolution from one to the other sets up a frame of reference in which it is possible to understand better not only pristine oral culture and subsequent writing culture, but also the print culture that brings writing to a new peak and the electronic culture which builds on both writing and print.  In this diachronic framework, past and present, Homer and television, can illuminate one another" (Ong 2)

"Our understanding of the differences between orality and literacy developed only in the electronic age, not earlier.  Contrasts between electronic media and print have sensitized us to the earlier contrast between writing and orality.  The electronic age is also an age of 'secondary orality,' the orality of telephones, radio, and television, which depends on writing and print for its existence" (Ong 2-3)


4.  Writing Restructures Consciousness

"A deeper understanding of pristine or primary orality enables us better to understand the new world of writing, what it truly is, and what functionally literate human beings really are:  beings whose thought processes do not grow out of simply natural powers but out of these powers as structured, directly or indirectly, by the technology of writing" (Ong 77)

"Writing establishes what has been called 'context-free' language (Hirsch 1977, pp. 21-3, 26) or 'autonomous' discourse (Olson 1980a), discourse which cannot be directly questioned or contested as oral speech can be because written discourse has been detached from its author" (Ong 77)

"There is no way directly to refute a text.  After absolutely total and devastating refutation, it says exactly the same thing as before" (Ong 78)

"Most persons are surprised, and many distressed, to learn that essentially the same objections commonly urged today against computers were urged by Plato in the _Phaedrus_ (274-7) and in the _Seventh Letter_ against writing.  Writing, Plato has Socrates say in the _Phaedrus_, is inhuman, pretending to establish outside the mind what in reality can be only in the midn.  It is a thing, a manufactured product.  The same of course is said of computers.  Secondly, Plato's Socrates urges, writing destroys memory.  Those who use writing will become forgetful, relying on an external resource for what they lack in internal resources.  Writing weakens the mind" (Ong 78)

"Those who are disturbed by Plato's misgivings about writing will be even more disturbed to find that print created similar misgivings when it was first introduced" (Ong 79)

"One weakness in Plato's position was that, to make his objections effective, he put them into writing, just as one weakness in anti-print positions is that their proponents, to make their objections more effective, put the objections into print" (Ong 79)

"Writing and print and the computer are all ways of technologizing the word.  Once the word is technologized, there is no effective way to criticize what technology has done with it without the aid of the highest technology available.  Moreover, the new technology is not merely used to convey the critique:  in fact, it brought the critique into existence" (Ong 79)

"Plato's entire epistemology was unwittingly a programmed rejection of the old oral, mobile, warm, personally interactive lifeworld of oral culture" (Ong 79)

"One of the most startling paradoxes inherent in writing is its close association with death" (Ong 80)

"Because we have by today so deeply interiorized writing, made it so much a part of ourselves, as Plato's age had not yet made it fully a part of itself (Havelock 1963), we find it difficult to consider writing to be a technology as we commonly assume printing and the computer to be" (Ong 80)

"Writing is in a way the most drastic of the three technologies.  It initiated what print and computers only continue, the reduction of dynamic sound to quiescent space, the separation of the word from the living present, where alone spoken words can exist" (Ong 81)

"Writing or script differs as such from speech in that it does not inevitably well up out of the unconscious" (Ong 81)

"To say writing is artificial is not to condemn it but to praise it.  Like other artificial creations and indeed more than any other, it is utterly invaluable and indeed essential for the realization of fuller, interior, human potentials.  Technologies are not mere exterior aids but also interior transformations of consciousness, and never more than when they affect the word" (Ong 81)

"Technologies are artificial, but -- paradox again -- artificiality is natural to human beings.  Technology, properly interiorized, does not degrade human life but on the contrary enhances it" (Ong 82)

"The fact is that by using a mechanical contrivance, a violinist or an organist can express something poignantly human that cannot be expressed without the mechanical contrivance.  To achieve such expression of course the violinist or organist has to have interiorized the technology, made the tool or machine a second nature, a psychological part of him or herself.  This calls for years of 'practice,' learning how to make the tool do what it can do.  Such shaping of a tool to oneself, learning a technological skill, is hardly dehumanizing" (Ong 82)

"a script is more than a mere memory aid.  Even when it is pictographic, a script is more than pictures.  Pictures represent objects....  A script in the sense of true writing, as understood here, does not consist of mere pictures, of representations of things, but is a representation of an *utterance*, of words that someone says or is imagined to say" (Ong 83)

"Using the term 'writing' in this extended sense to include any semiotic marking trivializes its meaning.  The critical and unique breakthrough into new worlds of knowledge was achieved within human consciousness not when simple semiotic marking was devised but when a coded system of visible marks was invented whereby a writer could determine the exact words that the reader would generate from the text" (Ong 83)

"Writing, in this ordinary sense, was and is the most momentous of all human technological inventions.  It is not a mere appendage to speech.  Because it moves speech from the oral-aural to a new sensory world, that of vision, it transforms speech and thought as well" (Ong 84)

"Most if not all scripts trace back directly or indirectly to some sort of picture writing, or, sometimes perhaps, at an even more elemental level, to the use of tokens" (Ong 84)

"Out of pictographs (a picture of a tree represents the word for a tree), scripts develop other kinds of symbols.  One kind is the ideograph, in which the meaning is a concept not directly represented by the picture but established by code" (Ong 85)

"Sound, as has earlier been explained, exists only when it is going out of existence.  I cannot have all of a word present at once:  when I say 'existence,' by the time I get to the '-tence,' the 'exis-' is gone.  The alphabet implies that matters are otherwise, that a word is a thing, not an event, that it is present all at once, and that it can be cut up into little pieces, which can even be written forwards and pronounced backwards" (Ong 90)

"Writing is often regarded at first as an instrument of secret and magic power" (Ong 92)

"shortly after the introduction of writing a 'craft literacy' develops (Havelock 1963; cf. Havelock and Herschell 1978).  At this stage writing is a trade practiced by craftsmen, whom others hire to write a letter or document as they might hire a stone-mason to build a house, or a shipwright to build a boat....  At such a craft-literacy stage, there is no need for an individual to know reading and writing any more than any other trade" (Ong 93)

"High literacy fosters truly written composition, in which the author composes a text which is previsely a text, puts his or her words together on paper.  This gives thought different contours from those of orally sustained thought" (Ong 94)

"Witnesses were *prima facie* more credible than texts because they could be challenged and made to defend their statements, whereas texts could not" (Ong 95)

"Visual presentation of verbalized material in space has its own particular economy, its own laws of motion and structure" (Ong 98)

"All this is quite a different world of order from anything in the oral sensibility, which has no way of operating with 'headings' or verbal linearity" (Ong 99)

"The extensive use of lists and particularly of charts so commonplace in our high-technology cultures is a result not simply of writing, but of the deep interiorization of print (Ong 1958b, pp 307-18, and passim), which implements the use of fixed diagrammatic word-charts and other informational uses of neutral space far beyond anything feasible in any writing culture" (Ong 99)

"Although they refer to sounds and are meaningless unless they can be related -- externally or in the imagination -- to the sounds or, more precisely, the phonemes they encode, written words are isolated from the fuller context in which spoken words come into being" (Ong 100)

"Writing is a solipsistic operation.  I am writing a book which I hope will be read by hundreds of thousands of people, so I must be isolated from everyone.  While writing the present book, I have left word that I am 'out' for hours and days -- so that no one, including persons who will presumably read the book, can interrupt my solitude" (Ong 100)

"'The writer's audience is always a fiction' (Ong 1977, pp. 53-81)....  The reader must also fictionalize the writer.  When my friend reads my letter, I may be in an entirely different frame of mind from when I wrote it.  Indeed, I may very well be dead.  For a text to convey its message, it does not matter whether the author is dead or alive.  Most books extant today were written by persons now dead.  Spoken utterance comes only from the living" (Ong 100-101)

"Writing is always a kind of imitation talking, and in a diary I therefore am pretending that I am talking to myself.  But I never really talk this way to myself.  Nor could I without writing or indeed without print.  The personal diary is a very late literary form, in effect unknown until the seventeenth century (Boerner 1969).  The kind of verbalized solipsistic reveries it implies are a product of consciousness as shaped by print culture.  And for which self am I writing?  Myself today?  As I think I will be ten years from now?  As I hope I will be?  For myself as I imagine myself or hope others may imagine me?" (Ong 101)

"The ways in which readers are fictionalized is the underside of literary history, of which the topside is the history of genres and the handling of character and plot" (Ong 101)

"To make yourself clear without gesture, without facial expression, without intonation, without a real hearer, you have to foresee circumspectly all possible meanings a statement may have for any possible reader in any possible situation, and you have to make your language work so as to come clear all by itself, with no existential context" (Ong 102-103)

"With writing, words once 'uttered,' outered, put down on the surface, can be eliminated, erased, changed.  There is no equivalent for this in an oral performance, no way to erase a spoken word: corrections do not remove an infelicity or an error, they merely supplement it with denial and patchwork" (Ong 103)

of English:  "a national written language has had to be isolated from its original dialect base, has discarded certain dialectal forms, has developed various layers of vocabulary from sources not dialectal at all, and has developed also certain syntactival peculiarities.  This kind of established written language [has been called] a 'grapholect'" (Ong 105)

"the grapholect includes all other dialects: it explains them as they cannot explain themselves" (Ong 106)

"The lexical richness of grapholects begins with writing, but its fullness is due to print" (Ong 106)

"when other dialects of a given language besides the grapholect vary from the grammar of the grapholect, they are not ungrammatical: they are simply using a different grammar, for language is structure, and it is impossible to use language without a grammar" (Ong 106)

"It is bad pedgogy to insist that because there is nothing 'wrong' with other dialects, it makes no difference whether or not speakers of another dialect learn the grapholect, which has resources of a totally different order of magnitude" (Ong 107)

"Women writers were no doubt influenced by works that they had read emanating from the Latin-based, academic, rhetorical tradition, but they themselves normally expressed themselves in a different, far less oratorical voice,w hich had a great deal to do with the rise of the novel" (Ong 110)
