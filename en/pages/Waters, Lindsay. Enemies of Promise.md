Part I: Barbarians at the Gates

"This essay is my attempt to urge academics to take steps to preserve and protect the independence of their activities, such as the writing of books and articles, as they once thought of them, before the market becomes our prison and the value of the book becomes undermined." (Waters 4)

"There has emerged the idea among administrators and some academic publishers themselves, who seem to feel compelled to comply with unreasonable expectations, that university presses should be turned into 'profit centers' and contribute to the general budget of the university.  Where did this idea come from?  It's bad.  We have financial records of publishing in the West since Gutenberg, and it is clear that books are a losing proposition." (Waters 5)

"My second concern, after the corporate makeover of the university, is my conviction that, in letting the temple be turned over to the money-changers, we have allowed those who want to hollow out and thereby desecrate our good books and publications become dominant in a number of fields, most egregiously in the humanities." (Waters 5)

"there is a causal connection between the corporatist demand for increased productivity and the draining of publication of any significance other than as a number." (Waters 6)

"When books cease being complex media and become rather objects to quantify, then it follows that all the other media that the humanities study lose value." (Waters 6)

-- "Cooking the Books":  World War II and the Transformation of the University

"The so-called free market -- which is anything but free -- is not a concept that should be considered the ultimate framework for the free play of ideas.
     The problem is that the advocates of the market say that what cannot be counted is not real." (Waters 9)
 
"This is Reaganomics for the Life of the Mind.  Empiricim makes people slaves to what they can see and count." (Waters 9)

"Money has restructured the US academy in its own image, and money is a blunt instrument." (Waters 10)

"The first result of the influx of money into the university was a new and much larger administrative layer piled on top of the  community of scholars in department.  As in US society as a whole, the administrators became more and more alienated from their clients and reconstructed the university as 'a social machine' (Paul Goodman's phrase) with a great interest in producing brand names for schools." (Waters 11)

-- The Growth of an Administrative Class

"The system of university publishing is beset with problems similar to many other valuable American forms of communication, such as the postal service (advertising), telephone (tele-marketing), and e-mail (spam).  These abuses of the system make us reluctant to answer the phone, open our e-mail, or look at a new book.  We clearly cannot shut down the postal and phone systems, and we cannot shut down the academic publishing system.  We need to reform them.  There is no way to stop the shake-up of the university press system from happening.  It has already begun." (Waters 13)

December 2000 policy paper: "Principles for Emerging Systems of Scholarly Publishing"

"A colleague asked the former president of an Ivy League university if he did not see humanists playing a key role in the university at the present critical moment, and the former chief executive indicated that he expected nothing from the humanities.  'They are a lost cause.'" (Waters 15)

-- The Boom

"The problem of ridiculous articles by humanists was caused partly by the vast increase of the numbers of publications that humanists (and all academics) are expected to perpetrate on paper or on one another as talks at conferences.  It all sounds like a world gone wrong, but the problem is not limited to the humanities.  We are experiencing a generalized crisis of judgment that results from unreasonable expectations about how many publications a scholar should publish." (Waters 18)

"The problem is the concentration on productivity without concern for reception.  The balance between these two elements -- production and reception -- is gone.  We need to restore the symmetry between them.  The problem is basing tenure on the quantity of publications, publications few read." (Waters 18)

"I wonder to what degree the proliferation of unused by dangerous weapons has influenced our thinking so that all production -- even that of scholarship -- has come to resemble the arms race?" (Waters 19) -- this seems a key point: if there was some mythical moment at which only the best books really got published, then publishing a book was a mark of distinction; the choice of the top universities to insist that their faculties must be distinguished enough to have published a book was the first move in the arms race, followed by every institution in the chain below requiring the same marker of achievement, finally leading the top institutions to require *two* books for tenure, etc.  If everyone has to publish a book, the number of books that must be published rises exponentially, and of necessity the book as a marker of distinction declines...

"It's now time to pause and understand just how inimical to the life of the mind this Boom has been, because teaching and serious writing had to take a backseat when publication for its own sake was glorified." (Waters 19)

Michael Powers's notion of the "audit society" that has pervaded academia

a professor in the sciences "laments the way scientific publications are valued with no concern for content: 'Often, review committees, when asked to make decisions on appointments and promotions, will look at the journal titles on a candidate's CV in lieu of reading the papers themselves.' // Reading the papers themselves!  What a quaint idea!  How medieval!" (Waters 20)
 
"As all throughout American society, what counts is the brand name, not whether the car will get you across town.  And, of course, no key word is more vapid in academic-speak than 'excellence,' as Bill Readings has forcefully argued in \_The University in Ruins'." (Waters 21)

-- The Twilight Zone

meltdown of the system being produced in part by the outsourcing of personnel evaluations to university presses

-- The Root of the Problem

Stanley Fish in response to Waters's claims:  "'I understand your argument against giving over tenure-judgments to university presses, but as a dean I use the process as a gate-keeping device.  I trust presses and their readers more than I trust departments...'" (qtd. in Waters 26)

"In fact, many universities do not even let promotion and tenure committees look at the writings of a candidate when the time comes for a decision, insisting that they look only at letters about the work." (Waters 27)

"Why cannot colleagues in department be trusted at least as much as my reviewers and faculty board?  And what, truly, are university presses to publish when books have become statistics of credit on a CV and debit on a university press account?  Who is to pay for the upkeep of the system Fish trusts, when presses are expected to produce tenure books no one reads or buys?" (Waters 28)

-- The Centrality of Judgment

"Judgment is the foundation upon which the humanities are built." (Waters 31)

"So, the tenure decision epitomizes the very work of the humanities.  When departments and administrators outsource judgment, they avoid the task of making up their own minds in freedom." (Waters 31-32)

"All this thinking about judgment was once central and well known, but it has become less well known during the twentieth century as corporatist thinking emerged and triumphed in politics, business, and the academy.  From Herbert Croly at the beginning of the twentieth century or Robert S. McNamara and on to Richard Rorty, leading intellects have believed that the group should eclipse the individual.  Be all that you can be: join the best and the brightest and learn to love the death of the subject, your own self!" (Waters 33) -- what this fails to grasp is the ways in which individualism is precisely bound up in corporate ideology, and that in a non-corporatist model of group interaction, the advancement of the individual is precisely predicated on the advancement of the group.  (Is this the stuff from Cyrus's book?)

"we might believe that because of the very hierarchical world we inhabit in the academy no one really expects us or wants us to exercise our judgment even in cases like tenure decisions that seem to call upon us to judge." (Waters 33)

"What I am suggesting is that it is not entirely surprising that individual faculty members began to think their own voices mattered less and less in tenure decisions than what seem like the professionally produced judgment of the university press.  The university press can be counted on to deliver a professional judgment, by which they mean detached and abstracted from life." (Waters 35)

-- The Crisis of Academic Accountability

"One of the things that makes the current situation intolerable is that in these circumstances an imprint functions in precisely the opposite way it is supposed to work.  In a healthy situation an imprint wins a book readers.  In this situation -- where publication is subordinate to the tenure mill -- a quality imprint means that no one needs to read the book because such an imprint means a book is of a certain meritoriousness and therefore does not need to be read."  (Waters 38)

"the academy has been marked by the development of increasingly technical language.  This is the language the managerial elite of the Fordist enterprise utilize in their documents." (Waters 39)

"Numbers are the poison, not the cure in this matter." (Waters 40) -- but what about applying judgment to numbers?


Part II:  From Cynicism to Iconoclasm -- The Promotion of the Status Quo

"The typical scholar feels more and more like the figure portrayed by Charlie Chaplin in the film 'Modern Times,' madly and insensibly working to produce." (Waters 45)

"Only the most extraordinary assistant professor could write a good book in the present situation, with the tenure gun pressed to his or her head, and with the expectation of rising productivity, he or she is anything but free." (Waters 46)

-- The New Generation Gap

"We have to acknowledge the conflict between generations in the academic world and the way the old seek to control the young in a way that is objectively unfair, as when senior faculty impose standards on younger colleagues for publication that they themselves did not and could not meet." (Waters 50)

"How does the war of the generations manifest itself?  In two ways that overlap: censorship and defense of the status quo." (Waters 51)

-- A New and Hidden Form of Censorship

"Why does the rise in demands for productivity come along with a seeming prohibition upon innovation?  Could what feels like the doldrums in the world of ideas be caused by the hyper-production model for publication that fosters a form of censorship and a shying away from the power of ideas to disrupt routine?" (Waters 53)

"Scholars are finally expressing an interest in the history of peer review." (Waters 54)

"perhaps the most disturbing question Biagioli poses is whether or not peer review is once again in the business of censorship" (Waters 54)

"It is in the fight to make the case for such books that I am really doing my job for scholarship.  It is there... at the margins of what is knowable that things get really interesting and murky.  But if you do not, as an editor, do this, the drive to censor the unusual will triumph." (Waters 55)

"The general talk of the age in the university makes the defense of the status quo so unpalatable that people who feel inclined to defend it have to disguise themselves as innovators and not the enemies of promise they really are." (Waters 56)

"More deathly than peer review is peer pressure.  'You won't get credit for such a publication when it comes time for a promotion or a raise.' And, 'You'd better not attach the ideas of this senior member of the profession in print, you lowly assistant professor, if you know what is good for you.'... There is much censorship before projects ever reach the desks of editors." (Waters 58-59)

-- The Problem: Timidity Masked as Boldness

"And so it came to be believed by many that the book is dead as a thing whose own content and form might not conform to the will of the masterful reader.  This bullying attitude to the text poses a deadly threat to the book just as do the number-crunching administrators or the librarians who want to clean their shelves of printed material." (Waters 65)

-- The Slide into Negativism

"The modern university takes the present organization of knowledge into separate disciplines, all those gated communities, as inevitable and as natural as the categories of niche-marketing." (Waters 72)

"Fifty years ago, even as recently as thirty years ago, scholars thought it a virtue to be widely read outside one's own field.  Not any more."  (Waters 72)

-- Why, Despite All, Books Still Matter

"If we were to revitalize the humanities, we would stop insisting that they be kept in antiseptically sealed realms, and we would let the ideas and methods and materials in them wash over each other and us." (Waters 75)

"We have abandoned learning for its own sake for the quest for credentials." (Waters 75)

-- Scholarship and Silence

"Band-aids don't stop hemorrhaging.  It is the time to ask what scholarship is about and -- I strongly suggest -- to change our standards." (Waters 77)

"Some have suggested that the new possibilities for electronic publishing will alleviate our problems.  In the wild ideas of some dreamers the new world of electronic publication will actually be an improvement over books.  To think this way is to fail to understand that electronic publication will only make the situation worse.  Moreover it was make things worse in a way that undermines the principles behind the culture of the book.  We had better put an end to such foolish talk and keep pressure on the librarians and ourselves to value the book better." (Waters 79) -- Wow.  No reasons why the digital will make things worse -- simply the blanket statement that it will, and the injunction to shut up about it already.  Is this not an enactment of Waters's own argument about censorship and the status quo?

"It is by no mean clear that the Web is a good medium for words.  It is fine for pornography, because like all electronic forms of reproduction it does a fine job making the gesture salient the way the hand salute performed over and over in Leni Riefenstahl's 'Triumph of the Will' turns humans into mere ornaments of the will of the leader." (Waters 80) -- from electronic representation to pornography to fascism, in one sentence???
