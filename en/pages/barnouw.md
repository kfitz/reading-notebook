# Barnouw, Erik.  Tube of Plenty: The Evolution of American Television.   1975.  2nd rev. ed.  New York: Oxford University Press, 1990.


## CHAPTER 1:  FORBEARS
- telephone (1876):  broadcasting v. narrowcasting
- “Nipkow disk” — scanning images (1884)
- related inventions: phonograph (1878), film (kinetoscope, 1894; cinematographe, 1895), radio
- movement from work of individual inventors to corporate battleground
### BLACK BOX NO. 1
- Gugliemo Marconi (b. 1874) — experimented w/ “Hertzian waves” 1894-95; invented wireless; brought to England by mother to demonstrate to British navy
- formation of British corporation (1897); much military interest
- Marconi comes to New York (1899) — Sp.-Am. War created desire for empire (manifest destiny); communications becoming an issue — formation of American Marconi (1899)
- U.S. boom in wireless manufacturing; desire to take control of American Marconi from British
### VOICES IN THE ETHER
- wireless as popular mania; drive to replace Morse code with human voice
- Fessenden:  modulated wave (1906); United Fruit Co.: crystal detectors; DeForest/AT&T: audion tube (1907) — audion tube foundation of electronics industry
- DeForest begins “broadcasting” in NY; by 1916, fairly regular schedule — but no economic promise
- chaos of transmissions: military, amateur, experimental
- GE & Westinghouse become dominant during WWI by turning light-bulb production lines to vacuum tubes; vast production/technical progress under direction of navy; all patent claims set aside for duration of war; all amateurs ruled off the air for duration of war
- post-war:  navy wants radio monopoly
### WE NEED A MONOPOLY
- hearings on navy monopoly; opposition from amateurs — defeated; navy pushes for “private monopoly in congenial hands” (21) — formation of RCA (1919)
- American Marconi transfers assets to RCA; parent co. GE joined by partners AT&T, Westinghouse, United Fruit
- explosive beginning of broadcasting era in late 1920; developments came so fast RCA was soon obsolete, but still target for anti-trust suits (see Edison’s Trust)

## CHAPTER 2:  TODDLER
- Westinghouse: experiments in broadcasting in Pittsburgh
### MERCHANDISING CONCEPT
- Frank Conrad’s 8XK mentioned in advertisement, seen by V.P. Davis; Davis envisions widening of market for receivers by maintaining regular programming; leads to building of 100-watt transmitter
- KDKA Pittsburgh goes on air 8 pm, 2 Nov 1920
- beginning of the fall of the newspaper
- expansion and growth; Westinghouse invited to join RCA partnership; RCA priority becomes broadcasting
- David Sarnoff becomes general manager of RCA (with military prez)
### RAGGLE-TAGGLE MOB
- loopholes in RCA’s control: radio business divided among RCA partners — except for amateurs
- amateurs begin building their own sets, making transmitters; in 1922, 500 stations begin broadcasting using “amateur” equipment; alliance begins crumbling
- RCA begins plans to drive “upstarts” out of business; begins anti-trust rumblings
### COME INTO OUR PHONE BOOTH
- 1922:  AT&T invents the commercial
- talent had been free, now demanded pay; also copyright and royalty expenses; court rules that broadcasting is a for-profit enterprise
- debates about how to finance:  endowed stations, government underwriters, radio set tax (British)
- 1922:  AT&T begins “toll broadcasting”; network of 38 linked “toll” stations
- AT&T wanted no responsibility for programming, but sale of time only feasible if there is an audience
- WEAF, New York, 1st toll station (became WRCA and WNBC); 5pm, 28 Aug 1922: 1st paid spot; 1st sponsored program: Jan. 1923
- growth:  rising radio advertising; long-distance pickups
- development of braodcast network:  special cables, “licenses”
- experimentation in television; AT&T using ad revenues to finance, claiming scheme was solely their property
- AT&T plans to market receivers; other partners hit roof — turn to arbitration, but Federal Trade Commission charges RCA w/ monopoly; from crisis, new structure in broadcasting emerges
### THE BIRTH OF NBC
- AT&T routed in arbitration, but manages to duck anti-trust charges; negotiations lead to formation of central broadcasting organization — NBC (RCA, 50%; GE 30%; Westinghouse 20%)
- by Jan. 1927, NBC red and NBC blue
- class & decorum at first; by 1928-29, earthier tone, esp. in drama (Amos & Andy, daytime serials)
- constellation of military, big business, and ad agencies controlling segment of popular culture; sponsors in control
BUT NOT THE OWNERSHIP THEREOF
- Radio Act of 1927:  estab. Federal Radio Commission to handle licensing process; licenses grant use of channel, not ownership
- clause refusing licenses to those convicted of unfair business practices
- nationwide structure in place; Act’s definition of “radio” includes television
### FLICKERING SNAPSHOT
- “television fever”; test broadcasts begin; Sept. 11, 1928, first dramatic production broadcast
- amateurs assembling television sets
- reasons for intensified work on television:  “talkies” create upheaval in H’wood; competition — CBS founded 1927 (William S. Paley, 1929, sold 49% share to P’mount)
- formation of RKO by RCA to compete w/ AT&T in sound film; RCA buys two music publishers
- television expected in 5 years — but stock frenzy leads to crash, depression — postponement
### A BILL OF DIVORCEMENT
- May 1930: new anti-trust suit; RCA, GE, AT&T,  & Westinghouse required to “untangle the corporate liaison” (68)
- NBC becomes wholly-owned subsidiary of RCA; RCA independent entity; NBC plans move to Radio City;
### FIFTY-THIRD FLOOR
- 1932: NBC installs TV station in Empire State Bldg.
- radio audiences grow during Depression; FDR’s “Fireside Chats”; new surge of radio talent
- tone of radio increasingly commercial
- replacement of FRC with FCC; demand for reassignment of channels (25% ed./non-profit) — fails, but sparks eruption of “public service” programming
- Sarnoff appeals to FCC for television space on spectrum and standards for TV system
### OF ATTICS AND BACK ROOMS
- competition from individual inventors:  Philo T. Farnsworth — electronic scanners; Edwin H. Armstrong — FM radio (began with wish for little black box to eliminate static; grew into whole system)
- Armstrong snubbed by RCA: sabotage?  Nov. 1935:  Armstrong demonstrates FM
- battle over upper frequencies by TV & FM; FM seen as disruptive to structure of radio and threat to funds for TV development; RCA works to block
- Armstrong builds experimental FM station
### TARGET DATE
- Farnsworth at Philco; experiments push forward
- 1936:  AT&T runs coaxial cable from NY to Philadelphia
- 1937:  television mobile unit
- date for debut picked:  1939 World’s Fair in NYC; world upheavals push TV aside
- CBS expansions:  news, drama
- gov’t diverts production to military uses; TV research put into radar
- formal opening of TV:  30 April 1939; FDR 1st pres on TV (NBC; CBS also broadcasting)
- May 1940:  TV falls back to experimental status due to conflicts over technical standards
- finally went fully commercial in 1941, but with restricted schedules
- TV nearly forgotten; postponed until after WWII
- development of image-orthicon camera tube
- FM also  diverted by war priorities; AM seems indestructible; Armed Forces Radio Service — worldwide AM reach
- FCC sues NBC; NBC blue sold to become ABC

## CHAPTER 3:  PLASTIC YEARS

- CBS color system pushed aside in favor of NBC’s black-and-white
MOSAIC
- TV news services begin development
- tavern TV sets; TV suddenly alive with activity; Zoomar lens; news programming
- radio used to pay TV bills — must minimize expenses and maximize radio profit; ABC begins use of recorded material on radio; NBC & CBS follow
- CBS 33 1/3 LP v. RCA 45
### OR AFFILIATED SYMPATHETICALLY
- FCC begins receiving messages from J. Edgar Hoover — red-baiting
- cold war mentality in broadcasting
- HUAC, Oct. 1947:  hearings on communism in Hollywood — TV coverage; Hollywood Ten & blacklist; broadcasting next
- American Business Consultants (pub. Counterattack) — commie hunters; put much pressure on broadcasting to clear out commies
FREEZE
- 1948 Rep. & Dem. conventions in Philly because of TV
- Truman:  broadcasters have sold out to special interests; kept media out of his campaign; Dewey used speeches rather than ads
- Truman won, but Congress kept witchhunt alive; “These were also the formative years for television.  Its program patterns, business practices, and institutions were being shaped.  Evolving from a radio industry born under military influence and reared by big business, it now entered an adolescence traumatized by phobias.  It would learn caution, and cowardice.” (Barnouw 112)
- TV “freeze” to study interference; extended due to Korean War; spotty distribution
- TV contributes to drop in film attendance; also drop in attendance of sporting events, nightclubs; taxis, libraries, bookstores, radio all affected
### PANIC CITY
- 1948:  anti-trust ruling against H’wood studios; big studio cut-backs; many artists come to TV
### IT WILL BE A GREAT SHOW
- Texaco Star Theater w/ Milton Berle; Toast of the Town w/ Ed Sullivan
- red-baiting on Ed Sullivan; Ed Sullivan begins consulting with Am. Bus. Cons.
### HANDY REFERENCE
- Am. Bus. Cons. publishes Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television; list of 151 “Reds,” most highly respected
- list seems preposterous — “a move to pillory the liberal impuses of two decades as traitorous” (Barnouw 124) — but cold war hysteria took over; many listed lost work; desire to avoid the controversial
### CRUSADE IN THE SUPERMARKETS
- expanded witchhunt — aimed at sponsors’ products; Vincent Hartnett, subversive-activities consultant; networks take over crusade themselves — blacklist in place
- blacklist gradually dropped from sight, but remained a presence
- many topics were too “dangerous”; law and order was always safe
### CRIME AUTOMATED
- episodic series:  most law and order; all produced live (circa 1949)
- restrictions on shows imposed by sponsors; pressures on productions staffs of live episodic series

### TELEVISION THEATER
- anthology series — from theater; few restrictions (for now), producer-controlled rather than sponsor-controlled (for now)
- flood of scripts:  Rod Serling, Paddy Chayefsky; Chayefsky’s Marty — choice of heroes and heroines who defy H’wood standards of beauty
- structure of plays paralleled production circumstances; importance of closeup
- manipulation of “film time” banished “real time” from screen; live TV drama re-introduced sense of reality — but drove drama indoors
- “the marvelous world of the ordinary” — hated by advertisers; sense of life’s complications made commercials with easy answers seem fraudulent — beginnings of sponsor control (1954-55)
- TV people begin moving back to film; death of the live anthology; series formula w/ clear-cut solutions
- increase in blacklist pressures, 1954-55
