Goodchild, Philip.  Deleuze & Guattari:  An Introduction to the Politics of Desire.  London:  Sage Publications, 1996.

Introduction:  Knowledge, Power, Desire

D&G’s “philosophy of desire”; “This book will argue that at the heart of Deleuze and Guattari’s combined thought lies an exploration of the possibilities of human relation, and their role in the reconstruction of subjectivity, society, and environment.” (Goodchild 2)

nomadism; rhizomatics; “Any move of thought or social relation is desirable, so long as it does not lead back into an old or new convention, obligation, or institution.” (Goodchild 2) = deterritorialization

but:  complete deterritorialization produces complete garbage; change cannot be an unchanging value

“Deterritorialization and nomadism are not ends in themselves for Deleuze and Guattari; instead, they wish to intensify social relations.  They desire to construct a social space where immanent relations can be produced.  Such immanent relations, instead of acting out roles given to them by some real or imaginary third party in the role of a transcendent scriptwriter, are capable of shaping, affecting, and changing any mediating factors just as easily as these can shape the relations, as if the script could also affect the scriptwriter.” (Goodchild 3)

D&G’s thought as machine:  bringing together a multiplicity of heterogeneous terms; “extracting terms from their social and cultural contexts that render them sterile and inactive, and assembling them into a constructive machine that is capable of producing something.” (Goodchild 3-4)

“Desire, a concept deterritorialized from adult sexuality while not losing its erotic character, becomes applicable in any context or relation:  it is a spontaneous emergence that generates relationship through a synthesis of multiplicities…. Desire is the machinic relation itself, in respect of both its power of coming into existence and the specific multiplicity to which it gives a consistency.” (Goodchild 4)

role of power in preventing the coming into existence of desire, multiplicity, and creation

book explores the interworkings of knowledge, desire and power

Part I:  Knowledge

1.  The Emergence of Desire

to say that D&G have a “philosophy of desire” can be misunderstood to mean that where others focus upon language, history, economics, culture, etc. as the structuring force of society, they have chosen desire; or that they address (sexual) desire as their field of inquiry; or that desire is their precondition of knowledge; or that expressions of sexual desire are key to social and cultural liberation – all are crude caricatures

explores “how desire posits itself as its own, autonomous concept” (Goodchild 11)

“a philosophy of desire as spontaneous, chaotic, and irreducible emergence” (Goodchild 11)

looks back through Deleuze’s early writings on philosophy, particularly that on Hume, Bergson, Nietzsche, and Spinoza

philosophical work attempting to shift from a transcendent/materialist position to an immanent/idealist one (?)
