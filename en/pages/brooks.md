# Brooks, Peter.  *Reading for the Plot: Design and Intention in Narrative*.  Cambridge, Mass:  Harvard University Press, 1992.

## Preface

"This is a book about plots and plotting, about how stories come to be ordered in significant form, and also about our desire and need for such orderings" (Brooks xi)

"We might think of plot as the logic or perhaps the syntax of a certain kind of discourse, one that develops its propositions only through temporal sequence and progression" (Brooks xi)

"the problem of temporality:  man's time-boundedness, his consciousness of existence within the limits of mortality" (Brooks xi)

our sense of plot has "been molded by the great nineteenth-century narrative tradition that, in history, philosophy, and a host of other fields as well as literature, conceived certain kinds of knowledge and truth to be inherently narrative, understandable (and expoundable) only by way of sequence, in a temporal unfolding" (Brooks xi-xii)

"Narrative as a dominant mode of representation and explanation comes to the fore -- speaking in large generalization -- with the advent of Romanticism and its predominantly historical imagination" (Brooks xii)

"In our own century, we have become more suspicious of plots, more acutely aware of their artifice, their arbitrary relation to time and chance, though we no doubt still depend on elements of plotting, however ironized or parodied, more than we realize" (Brooks xii)

"I have looked for the ways in which the narrative texts themselves appear to represent and reflect on their plots.  Most viable works of literature tell us something about how they are to be read, guide us toward the conditions of their interpretation" (Brooks xii)

"Even more than with plot, no doubt, I shall be concerned with plotting:  with the activity of shaping, with the dynamic aspect of narrative -- that which makes a plot 'move forward,' and makes us read forward, seeing in the unfolding of the narrative a line of intention and a portent of design that hold the promise of progress toward meaning.  My interest in the dynamics of narrative, and in plotting as a human activity, entails an attempt to move beyond strict allegiance to the various formalisms that have dominated the study of narrative in recent decades, including the substantial body of structuralist work on narrative, of the type that the French, with a nice sense of neologism, have baptized 'narratology,' meaning the organzied and coherent analysis of narrative structures and discourse.  I have learned much from narratology, and I owe a general debt to the tendency of structuralist thought as a whole to see literature as one part of a wider range of man's signifying practices, the way he reshapes his world through the use of signs and fictions.... But for my purposes, narratological models are excessively static and limiting.  Whatever its larger ambitions, narratology has in practice been too exclusively concerned with the identification of minimal narrative unitys and paradigmatic structures; it has too much neglected the temporal dynamics that shape narratives in our reading of them, the play of desire in times that makes us turn pages and strive toward narrative ends" (Brooks xiii)

"My interest in loosening the grip of formalism has taken me to psychoanalysis, particularly to the work of Freud himself, which presents a dynamic model of psychic processes and thus may offer the promise of a model pertinent to the dynamics of texts.  Psychoanalysis, after all, is primarily a narrative art, concerned with the recovery of the past through the dynamics of memory and desire.  And Freud's own project was much mroe closely concerned with the use and understanding of signs, especially narrative signs, than has usually been acknowledged, as the rereading of Freud proposed by Jacques Lacan can help us to see" (Brooks xiv)

"I want to see the text itself as a system of internal energies and tensions, compulsions, resistances, and desires" (Brooks xiv)

"psychoanalysis promises, and requires, that in addition to linguistic paradigms and the rules of the sign-system, we engage the dynamic of memory and the history of desire as they work to shape the creation of meaning within time.  My aim here is in some measure to make good on the claim -- put forward by Susan Sontag some years ago -- that rather than theories of interpretation we need an 'erotics' of art" (Brooks xiv-xv)

## 1. Reading for the Plot

"Our lives are ceaselessly intertwined with narrative, with the stories that we tell and hear told, those we dream or imagine or would like to tell, all of which are reworked in that story of our own lives that we narrate to ourselves in an episodic, sometimes semi-conscious, but virtually uninterrupted monologue" (Brooks 3)

"Children quickly become virtual Aristotelians, insisting upon any storyteller's observation of the 'rules,' upon proper beginnings, middles, and particularly ends" (Brooks 3)

"'Reading for the plot,' we learned somewhere in the course of our schooling, is a low form of activity.... The texture of narrative has been considered most interesting insofar as it approached the density of poetry.  Plot has been disdained as the element of narrative that least sets off and defines high art -- indeed, plot is that which especially characterizes popular mass-consumption literature:  plot is why we read _Jaws_, but not Henry James" (Brooks 4)

"Plot is the principle of interconnectedness and intention which we cannot do without in moving through the discrete elements -- incidents, episodes, actions -- of a narrative:  even such loosely articulated forms as the picaresque novel display devices of interconnectedness, structural repetitions that allow us to construct a whole; and we can make sense of such dense and seemingly chaotic texts as dreams beacuse we use interpretive categories that enable us to reconstruct intentions and connections, to replot the dream as a narrative" (Brooks 5)

"The enormous narrative production of the nineteenth century may suggest an anxiety at the loss of providential plots:  the plotting of the individual or social or institutional life story takes on new urgency when one no longer can look to a sacred masterplot that organizes and explains the world" (Brooks 6)

"with the advent of Modernism came an era of suspicion toward plot, engendered perhaps by an overelaboration of and overdependence on plots in the nineteenth century.  If we cannot do without plots, we nonetheless feel uneasy about them, and feel obliged to show up their arbitrariness, to parody their mechanisms while admitting our dependence on them" (Brooks 7)

"I want to urge a conception of plot as something in the nature of the logic of narrative discourse, the organizing dynamic of a specific mode of human understanding" (Brooks 7)

"Folktale and myth may be seen to show narrative as a form of thinking, a way of reasoning about a situation" (Brooks 9)

"Plot, let us say in preliminary definition, is the logic and dynamic of narrative, and narrative itself a for of understanding and explanation" (Brooks 10)

"It is Aristotle's claim that plot (mythos) and action (praxis) are logically prior to the other parts of dramatic fictions, including character (ethos)" (Brooks 10)

"Plot, then, is conceived to be the outline or armature of the story, that which supports and organizes the rest.  From such a view, Aristotle proceeds to derive three consequences.  First, the action imitated by the tragedy must be complete in itself.  This in turn means that it must have a beginning, a middle, and an end -- a point wholly obvious but one that will prove to have interesting effects in its applications.  Finally, just as in the visual arts a whole must be of a size that can be taken in by the eye, so a plot must be 'of a length to be taken in by the memory.'  This is important, since memory -- as much in reading a novel as in seeing play -- is the key faculty in the capacity to perceive relations of beginning, middles, and ends through time, the shaping power of narrative" (Brooks 11)

multiple sense of "plot": piece of land, diagram of building, series of events, secret plan; "There may be a subterranean logic connecting these heterogeneous meanings.  Common to the original sense of the word is the idea of boundedness, demarcation, the drawing of lines to mark off and order" (Brooks 12)

on the conspiracy:  "in modern literature this sense of plot nearly always attaches itself to the others: the organizing line of plot is more often than not some scheme or machination, a concerted plan for the accomplishment of some purpose which goes against the ostensible and dominant legalities of the fictional world, the realization of a blocked and resisted desire.  Plots are not simply organizing structures, they are also intentional structures, goal-oriented and forward-moving" (Brooks 12)

plot as "an embracing concept for the design and intention of narrative... a structuring operation elicited by, and made necessary by, those meanings that develop through succession and time" (Brooks 12)

"any narrative presents a selection and an ordering of material... the *fabula* -- 'what really happened' -- is in fact a mental construction that the reader derives from the *sjužet*, which is all that he ever directly knows" (Brooks 13)

"'Plot' in fact seems to me to cut across the *fabula*/*sjužet* distinction in that to speak of plot is to consider both story elements and their ordering.  Plot could be thought of as the interpretive activity elicited by the distinction between *sjužet* and *fabula*, the way we *use* the one against the other" (Brooks 13)

Ricoeur:  "A story is *made out of* events to the extent that the plot *makes* events *into* a story" (Brooks 14)

Propp and morphological analysis; Greimas and dramatis personae; Todorov and syntax of narrative

Barthes and S/Z:  "Barthes's two irreversible codes -- those that must be decoded successively, moving in one direction -- the *proairetic* and the *hermeneutic*, that is:  the code of actions ("Voice of the Empirical") adn the code of enigmas and answers ("Voice of Truth").  The proairetic concerns the logic of actions, how their completion can be derived from their initiation, how they form sequences.  The limit-case of a purely proairetic narrative would be approached by the picaresque tale, or the novel of pure adventure:  narratives that give precedence to the happening.  The hermeneutic code concerns rather the questions and answers that structure a story, their suspense, partial unveiling, temporary blockage, eventual resolution, with the resulting creation of a 'dilatory space' -- the space of suspense -- which we work through toward what is felt to be, in classical narrative, the revelation of meaning that occurs when the narrative sentence reaches full predication.  The clearest and purest example of the hermeneutic would no doubt be the detective story, in that everything in the story's structure, and its temporality, depends on the resolution of enigma.  Plot, then, might best be thought of as an 'overcoding' of the proairetic by the hermeneutic" (Brooks 18)

"The source of the codes is in what Barthes calls the *déjà-lu*, the already read (and the already written), in the writer's and the reader's experience of other literature, in a whole set of intertexual interlockings.  In other words, structures, functions, sequences, plot, the possibility of following a narrative and making sense of it, belong to the reader's literary competence, his traiting as a reader of narrative.  The reader is in this view himself virtually a text, a composite of all that he has read, or heard read, or imagined as written.  Plot, as the interplay of two of Barthes's bodes, thus comes to appear one central way in which we as readers make sense, first of the text, and then, useing the text as an interpretive model, of life" (Brooks 19)

"As Barthes writes in an earlier essay ('Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative'), what animates us as readers of narrative is *la passion du sens*, which I would want to translate as both the passion *for* meaning and the passion *of* meaning" (Brooks 19)

Genette on relationship among story, plot, and narrating

"It is, I think, no accident that most of the great examples of narrative are long and can occupy our reading time over days or weeks or more:  if we think of the effects of serialization (which, monthly, or weekly, or even daily, was the medium of publication for many of the great nineteenth-century novels) we can perhaps grasp more nearly how time in the representing is felt to be a necessary analogue of time represented" (Brooks 21)

"Plot as a logic of narrative would hence seem to be analogous to the syntax of meaning that are temporally unfolded and recovered, meanings that cannot otherwise be created or understood" (Brooks 21)

"It is my simple conviction, then, that narrative has something to do with time-boundedness, and that plot is the internal logic of the discourse of mortality" (Brooks 22)

Benjamin:  "what we seek in narrative fictions is that knowledge of death which is denied to us in our own lives: the death that writes *finis* to the life and therefore confers on it its meaning" (Brooks 22)

"It is to my mind an interesting and not wholly resolvable question how much, and in what ways, we in reading image the pastness of the action presented, in most cases, in verbs in the past tense" (Brooks 22)

"If the past is to be read as present, it is a curious present that we know to be past in relation to a future we know to be already in place, already in wait for us to reach it.  Perhaps we would do best to speak of the *anticipation of retrospection* as our chief tool in making sense of narrative, the master trope of its strange logic" (Brooks 23)

"The work of detection in this story makes particularly clear a condition of all classic detective fiction, that the detective repeat, go over again, the ground that has been covered by his predecessor, the criminal.... Furthermore, in repeating the steps of the criminal-predecessor, Holmes is literalizing an act that all narrative claims to perform, since narrative ever, and inevitably -- if only because of its use of the preterite -- presents itself as a repetition and rehearsal (which the French language, of course, makes the same thing) of what has already happened" (Brooks 24-25)

"the framed tale which, dramatizing the relations of tellers and listeners, narrators and narratees, regularly enacts the problematic of transmission, looking for the sign of recognition and the promise to carry on, revealing, too, a deep anxiety about the possibility of transmission" (Brooks 28)

"In an essay called 'Story and Discourse in the Analysis of Narrative,' Jonathan Culler has argued that we need to recognize that narrative proceeds according to a 'double logic,' in that at certain problematic moments story events seem to be produced by the requirements of the narrative discourse, its needs of meaning, rather than vice-versa, as we normally assume" (Brooks 28)

"prior events, causes, are only so retrospectively, in a reading back from the end" (Brooks 29)

"In claiming the need to *tout dire*, Rousseau makes explicit that the contradictions encountered in the attempt to understand and present the self in all its truth provide a powerful narrative machine.  Any time one goes over a moment of the past, the machine can be relied on to produce more narrative -- not only differing stories of the past, but future scenarios and narratives of writing itself.  There is simply no end to narrative on this model, since there is no 'solution' to the 'crime'" (Brooks 33)

"As Sartre claimed, in order to narrate one's life one must become one's own obituary.  Rousseau writes so many obituaries he finally subverts the necrological form: he is ever reborn" (Brooks 33)

"Narrative thus seems ever to imagine in advance the act of its transmission, the moment of reading and understanding that it cannot itself ever know, since this act always comes after the writing, in a posthumous moment" (Brooks 34)

"Our example from the 'proairetic' end of the narrative spectrum has turned out to be fully as 'hermeneutic' as the detective story.  This should cause us no surprise, since any narrative, from the very simplest, is hermeneutic in intention, claiming to retrace event in order to make it available to consciousness" (Brooks 34)

"If I emphasize plotting even more than plot, it is because the participle best suggests the dynamic aspect of narrative that most interests me:  that which moves us forward as readers of the narrative text, that which makes us -- like the heroes of the text often, and certainly like their authors -- want and need plotting, seeking through the narrative text as it unfurls before us a precipitation of shape and meaning, some simulacrum of understanding of how meaning can be construed over and through time" (Brooks 35)

"we look to a convergence of psychoanalysis and literary criticism because we sense that there ought to be a correspondence between literary and psychic dynamics, since to an important degree we define and construct our sense of self through our fictions, within the constraints of a transindividual symbolic order" (Brooks 36)

## 2. Narrative Desire

"Plot as we have defined it is the organizing line and intention of narrative, thus perhaps best conceived as an activity, a structuring operation elicited in the reader trying to make sense of those meanings that develop only through textual and temporal succession.  Plot in this view belongs to the reader's 'competence,' and in his 'performance' -- the reading of narrative -- it animates the sense-making process:  it is a key component of that 'passion of (for) meaning' that, Barthes says, lights us afire when we read.  We can, then conceive of the reading of plot as a form of desire that carries us forward, onward, though the text.  Narrative both tell of desire -- typically present some story of desire -- and around and make use of desire as dynamic of signification" (Brooks 37)

"Desire is always there at the start of a narrative, often in a state of initial arousal, often having reached a state of intensity such that movement must be created, action undertaken, change begun" (Brooks 38)

"By the nineteenth century, the *pícaro*'s scheming to stay alive has typically taken a more elaborated and socially defined form:  it has become ambition" (Brooks 39)

"The ambitious hero thus stands as a figure of the reader's efforts to construct meanings in ever-larger wholes, to totalize his experience of the human existence in time, to grasp past, present, and future in a significant shape.  This description, of course, most obviously concerns male plots of ambition" (Brooks 39)

"The ambitious heroes of the nineteenth-century novel -- those of Balzac, for instance -- may regularly be conceived as 'desiring machines' whose presence in the text creates and sustains narrative movement through the forward march of desire, projecting the self onto the world through scenarios of desire imagined and then acted upon" (Brooks 39-40)

"But to characterize desire as a machine may be inadequate.  As Michel Serres has argued, the eighteenth century's preoccupation with the machine, as a system for the transmission of forces outside itself, gives way in the nineteenth century to fascination with the motor, containing its source of movement within itself, built on the three principles of difference (of temperature), reservoir (of fuel), and circulation" (Brooks 41)

"Life in the text of the modern is a nearly thermodynamic process; plot is, most aptly, a steam engine" (Brooks 44)

"The generally anti-industrial and antitechnological attitude of most nineteenth-century poets and novelists is more and more matched by a fascination with engines and forces" (Brooks 45)

"My interest in these emblematic motors and engines invented by novelists, as by Freud, derives from my dissatisfaction with the various formalisms that have dominated critical thinking about narrative, and from my search for models that would be more adequate to our experience of reading narrative as a dynamic operation -- what makes plot move us forward to the end, to put it in simples terms" (Brooks 47)

"Desire as narrative thematic, desire as narrative motor, and desire as the very intention of narrative language and the act of telling all seem to stand in close interrelation" (Brooks 54)

"Lacan's interpretation of the concept of desire, desire as born of the difference or split between need and demand.... To cite Jean Laplanche and J.-B. Pontalis:  'Desire is born from the gap [*l'écart*] between need and demand; it is irreducible to need,f or it is not in its principle relation to a real object, independent of the subject, but rather to a phantasy; it is irreducible to demand, in that it seeks to impose itself without taking account of language and the unconscious of the other, and insists upon being absolutely recognized by the other.'  In this gap, desire comes into being as a perpetual want for (of) a satisfaction that cannot be offered in reality.  Desire is inherently unsatisfied and unsatisfiable since it is linke to memory traces and seeks its realization in the hallucinatory reproduction of indestructible signs of infantile satisfaction:  it reposes on phantasmatic scenarios of satisfaction" (Brooks 55)

"One can now begin to grasp the manner in which desire comes to inhabit the language of narration.  In Lacan's interpretation of the Saussurian analysis of the sign, the bar separating signifier from signified (S/s) becomes the bar of repression, indicating the inaccessibility of the true signified (the object of unconscious desire)" (Brooks 55)

"If narrative desire keeps us moving forward, it is because narrative metonymy can never quite speak its name" (Brooks 56)

"Narrative is hence condemned to *saying* other than what it *would mean*, spinning out its movement toward a meaning that would be the end of its movement" (Brooks 56)

"The psychoanalyst, as my last quotation from Lacan notes, hears the voice of dead desire most particularly in the transference, in the reproductive workings-through of the life story triggered by the analysand-analyst relation, a possible model of text and reading that will need more thorough exploration later on" (Brooks 58)

"the unfettered, digressive line of Tristram's narrative, the incessant detours of its plot" (Brooks 59)

"The narrative act discovers, and makes use of, the intersubjective nature of language itself, medium for the exchange of narrative understandings" (Brooks 60)

on Scheherezade:  "Narrative, in this allegory, is seen to be life-giving in that it arouses and sustains desire, ensuring that the terminus it both delays and beckons toward will offer what we might call a lucid repose, desire both come to rest and set in perspective" (Brooks 61)

## 3. The Novel and the Guillotine, or Fathers and Sons in _Le Rouge et le noir_

paternity as the "dominant issue" of nineteenth and early twentieth century novels

Freud and the "family romance"

"It may be significant, as Roland Barthes notes, that the child appears to 'discover' the Oedipus complex and the capacity for constructing coherent narrative at about the same stage in life.  The most fully developed narratives of the child become a man all seem to turn on the uncertainty of fatherhood, to use this uncertainty to unfold the romance of authority vested elsewhere, and to test the individual's claim to personal legitimacy within a struggle of different principles of authority" (Brooks 64)

"Plot itself -- narrative design and intention -- is the figure of displacement, desire leading to change of position.  The plotted narrative is a deviance from or transgression of the normal, a state of abnormality and error, which alone is 'narratable'" (Brooks 84-85)

## 4. Freud's Masterplot: A Model for Narrative

"Our exploration so far of how plots may work and what may motivate them suggests, if not the need, at least the intellectual desirability of finding a model -- a model that would provide a synthetic and comprehensive grasp of the workings of plot, in the most general sense, and of the uses for plot.  To meet these requirements, such a model will have to be more dynamic than those most often proposed by the structuralists; it will have to provide ways to think about the movement of plot and its motor force in human desire, its peculiar relation to beginnings and ends, its apparent claim to rescue meaning from temporal flux" (Brooks 90)

"by attempting to superimpose psychic functioning on textual functioning, we may discover something about how textual dynamics work and something about their psychic equivalences" (Brooks 90)

"Narrative operates as metaphor in its affirmation of resemblance, in that it brings into relation different actions, combines them through perceived similarities (Todorov's common predicate term), appropriates them to a common plot, which implies the rejection of merely contingent (or unassimilable) incident or action.  Plot is the structure of action in closed and legible wholes; it thus must *use* metaphor as the trope of its achieved interrelations, and it must *be* metaphoric insofar as it is totalizing. Yet it is equally apparent that the key figure of narrative must in some sense be not metaphor but metonymy:  the figure of contiguity and combination, of the syntagmatic relation" (Brooks 91)

"Barthes makes explicit an assumption common to much thought about narrative when he claims that meaning (in the 'classical' or 'readable' text) resides in full predication, completion of the codes in a 'plenitude' of signification, which makes the 'passion for meaning' ultimately desire for the end.  It is the end -- for Barthes as for Aristotle -- that recognition brings its illumination, which then can shed retrospective light" (Brooks 92)

on Sartre's _La Nausée_:  "In Roquentin's argument, the beginning presupposes the end, since the concept of an ending is necessary to that of a beginning.... The very possibility of meaning plotted through sequence and through time depends on the anticipated structuring force of the ending:  the interminable would be the meaningless, and the lack of ending would jeopardize the beginning" (Brooks 93)

"The sense of a beginning, then, must in some important way be determined by the sense of an ending" (Brooks 94)

"Sartre in emulation began to see himself as a book, being read by posterity 'from death to birth'; he undertook to live his life retrospectively, in terms of the death that alone would confer meaning and necessity on existence.  As he most succinctly puts it, 'I became my own obituary'" (Brooks 95)

"The further we inquire into the problem of ends, the more it seems to compel a further inquiry into its relation to the human end.  As Frank Kermode has put it, man is always 'in the middest,' without direct knowledge of origin or endpoint, seeking the imaginative equivalents of closure that will confer significance on experience" (Brooks 95)

"Hence Benjamin can state that 'Death is the sanction of everything that the storyteller can tell.'  While this need not be a literal death -- it can be some simulacrum, some end to a period, an arrest -- very often it is" (Brooks 95)

"Whatever their specific content, and whatever their degree of tragic awareness or melodramatic enunciation, all such scenes offer the promise of a significant retrospect, a summing-up, the coming to completion of a fully predicated, and readable, sentence" (Brooks 96)

"We need to think further about the deathlike ending, its relation to origin, and to initiatory desire, and about how the interrelation of the two may determine and shape the middle -- the 'dilatory space' of postponement and error -- and the kinds of vacillation between illumination and blindness that we find there" (Brooks 96)

"_Beyond the Pleasure Principle_ constitutes Freud's own masterplot, the essay where he lays out most fully a total scheme of how life proceeds from beginning to end, and how each individual life in its own manner repeats the masterplot and confronts the question of whether the closure of an individual life is contingent or necessary... ultimately he is talking about the very possibility of talking about life -- about its very 'narratability'" (Brooks 96-97)

"If repetition is mastery, movement from the passive to the active, and if mastery is an assertion of control over what many must in fact submit to -- choice, we might say, of an imposed end -- we have already a suggestive comment on the grammar of plot, where repetition, taking us back again over the same ground, could have to do with the choice of ends" (Brooks 98)

"repetition is so basic to our experience of literary texts that one is simultaneously tempted to say all and to say nothing on the subject" (Brooks 99)

"Narrative, we have seen, must ever present itself as a repetition of events that have already happened, and within this postulate of a generalized repetition it must make use of specific, perceptible repetitions in order to create plot, that is, to show us a significant interconnection of events" (Brooks 99)

"Repetition creates a *return* in the text, a doubling back.  We cannot say whether this return is a return *to* or a return *of*: for instance, a return to origins or a return of the repressed" (Brooks 100)

"This inescapable middle is suggestive of the demonic:  repetition and return are perverse and difficult, interrupting simple movement forward" (Brooks 100)

"the repetition of traumatic experiences in the dreams of neurotics can be seen to have the function of seeking retrospectively to master the flood of stimuli, to perform a mastery or binding of mobile energy through developing that anxiety which earlier was lacking -- a lack which permitted the breach and thus caused the traumatic neurosis" (Brooks 100)

"Repetition in all its literary manifestations may in fact work as a 'binding,' a binding of textual energies that allows them to be mastered by putting them into serviceable form, usable 'bundles,' within the energetic economy of the narrative" (Brooks 101)

"Textual energy, all that is aroused into expectancy and possibility in a text, can become usable by plot only when it has been bound or formalized" (Brooks 101)

"What operates in the text through repetition is the death instinct, the drive toward the end" (Brooks 102)

"plot starts (or must give the illusion of starting) from that moment at which story, or 'life,' is stimulated from quiescence into a state of narratibility, into a tension, a kind of irritation, which demands narration" (Brooks 103)

"As Sartre and Benjamin compellingly argued, the narrative must tend toward its end, seek illumination in its own death.  Yet this must be the right death, the correct end" (Brooks 103)

"The desire of the text (the desire of reading) is hence desire for the end, but desire for the end reached only through the at least minimally complicated detour, the intentional deviance, in tension, which is the plot of narrative" (Brooks 104)

"Desire necessarily becomes textual by way of a specifically narrative impulse, since desire is metonymy, a forward drive in the signifying chain, an insistence of meaning toward the occulted objects of desire" (Brooks 105)

"We emerge from reading _Beyond the Pleasure Principle_ with a dynamic model that structures ends (death, quiescence, nonnarratibility) against beginnings (Eros, stimulation into tension, the desire of narrative) in a manner that necessitates the middle as detour, as struggle toward the end under the compulsion of imposed delay, as arabesque in the dilatory space of the text.  The model proposes that we live in order to die, hence that the intentionality of plot lies in its orientation toward the end even while the end must be achieved only through detour" (Brooks 107-108)

"It may finally be in the logic of our argument that repetition speaks in the text of a return which ultimately subverts the very notion of beginning and end, suggesting that the idea of beginning presupposes the end, that the end is a time before the beginning, and hence that the interminable never can be finally bound in a plot" (Brooks 109)

"It is the role of fictional plots to impose an end which yet suggests a return, a new beginning: a rereading" (Brooks 109)

"Plot mediates meanings within the contradictory human world of the eternal and the mortal.  Freud's masterplot speaks of the temporality of desire, and speaks to our very desire for fictional plots" (Brooks 112)

5.  Repetition, Repression, and Return:  The Plotting of _Great Expectations_

"nineteenth-century novels regularly conceive plot as *complot*:  they are structured by a plotting for and toward something, a machination of desire" (Brooks 113)

"Some narratives clearly give us a sense of plotting and of 'plottedness' more than others, and in particular a sense that their central meanings comes to us through plotting: that there is no disjuncture between idea and symbol on the one hand, and the requirements of narrative design on the other" (Brooks 113)

"If the novels of Joyce and Woold and Proust and Gide, and then Faulkner and Robbe-Grillet, cannot ultimately do without plotting insofar as they remain narrative structures that signify, they plot with irony and bad conscience, intent (in their very different ways) to expose the artifices of formal structure and human design.  Whereas it was part of the triumph of the nineteenth-century novel in its golden age to plot with a good conscience, in confidence that the elaboratin of plot corresponded to, and illuminated, human complexities" (Brooks 113-14)

"When we ask the questions, How do we find significant plots for our lives?  How do we make life narratable? we find that the answers are most clearly dramatized in narratives of an autobiographical case, since these cannot evade an explicit concern with problems of closure, authority, and narratability.  As Sartre argued, autobiographical narration must necessarily be 'obituary' -- must in any event explicitly show margins outside the narratable, leftover spaces which allow the narrating *I* to objectify and look back at the narrated *I*, and to see the plotted middle as shaped by and as shaping its margins" (Brooks 114)

"If we can accept the idea of a textual energetics, we can see that in any well-plotted novel the energies released and aroused in the text, especially in its early moments, will not be lost: the text is a kind of thermodynamic plenum, obeying the law of the conservation of energy (as well, no doubt, as the law of entropy).  Repetition is clearly a major operative principle of the system, shaping energy, giving it perceptible form, form that the text and the reader can work with in the construction of thematic wholes and narrative orders" (Brooks 123)

"Is repetition sameness or difference?  To repeat evidently implies resemblance, yet can we speak of resemblance unless there is difference?" (Brooks 124)

"As Kierkegaard writes near the beginning of _Repetition_, 'Repetition and recollection are the same movement, only in opposite directions; for what is recollected has been, is repeated backwards, whereas repetition properly is repeated forwards'" (Brooks 124)

reading of _Great Expectations_ points out a "paradox that in this most highly plotted of novels, where Dickens performs all his thematic demonstrations through the manipulation of plot, we witness an evident subversion and futilization of the very concept of plot" (Brooks 136)

"Plot, we come to understand, was a state of abnormality or deviance, suggested thematically by its uneasy position between Newgate and Old Bailey, between criminality and the law.  The nineteenth-century novel in general -- and especially that highly symptomatic development, the detective story -- regularly conceives plot as a condition of deviance and abnormality, the product of cities and social depths, of a world where *récit* is *complot*, where all stories are the result of plotting, and plotting is very much machination.  Deviance is the very condition for life to be 'narratable': the state of normality is devoid of interest, energy, and the possibility for narration.  In between a beginning prior to plot and an end beyond plot, the middle -- the plotted text -- has been in a state of *error*: wandering and misinterpretation" (Brooks 138-39)

"repetition is a kind of remembering, and thus a way of reorganizing a story whose connective links have been obscured and lost.  If repetition speaks of the death instinct, the finding of the right end, then what is being played out in repetition is necessarily the proper vector of the drive toward the end.  That is, once you have determined the right plot, plot is over.  Plot itself is working-through" (Brooks 139-40)

"What, finally, do we make of the fact that Dickens, master-plotter in the history of the novel, in this most tightly and consistently plotted of his novels seems to expose plot as a kind of necessary error?" (Brooks 140)

"In the absence or silence of divine masterplots, the organization and interpretation of human plots remains as necessary as it is problematic.  Reading the signs of intention in life's actions is the central act of existence, which in turn legitimizes the enterprise of reading for the reader of _Great Expectations_ -- or perhaps, vice versa, since the reading of plot within the text and as the text are perfectly analogous, mirrors of one another.  If there is by the end of the narrative an abandonment of the attempt to read plot, this simply mirrors the fact that the process or narration has come to a close -- or, again, vice versa.  But that there should be a cure from the reading of plot within the text -- before its very end -- and the reastion of a leftover, suggests a critique of reading itself" (Brooks 141-42)

"We are condemned to repetition, rereading, in the knowledge that what we discover will always be that there was nothing to be discovered" (Brooks 142)

6.  The Mark of the Beast:  Prostitution, Serialization, and Narrative

"If plots seem frequently to be about investments of desire and the effort to bind and master intensive levels of energy, this corresponds on the one hand to narratives thematically oriented toward ambition, possession, mastery of the erotic object and of the world, and on the other hand to a certain experience of reading narrative, itself a process of reaching for possession and mastery.  Speaking reductively, without nuance, one might say that on the one hand narrative tends toward a thematics of the desired, potentially possessable body, and on the other toward a readerly experience of consuming, a having that, in an era of triumphant capitalism, is bound to take on commercial forms, giving to the commerce in narrative understandings a specifically commercial tinge" (Brooks 143)

"the body of the prostitute is clearly the meeting point of Eros and commerce" (Brooks 145)

"a certain affinity between the body of the prostitute and commercial writing, which the considerable literature on prostitution -- sometimes serious, more often exploitative -- at this period only confirms" (Brooks 146)

"The *roman-feuilleton* -- the serial novel running in regular installments in the daily newspaper -- was an early capitalist invention that helped to create modern mass-circulation journalism" (Brooks 146)

"Hence the creation of modern mass journalism, and its power, not only permitted the emergence of the *roman-Feuilleton*; it quite directly depended on this first industrial form of literature.  The successful *feuilletonistes* not only learned to live exclusively by the products of their pens, they were paid by the line and learned to shape their plots to the exigencies of serialization" (Brooks 147)

"If we think of traditional storytelling as allied with travel, with the reports of those coming from afar, and with the marvelous, the realm of the folktake and its story of victory over hostile forces, we may conceive that in the banal nineteenth century, where (as Balzac, for instance, frequently complains) everything is becoming standardized and boring, the world of the social depths -- of the professionally deviant, so to speak -- comes to appear the last place of stories ready to hand, the last vestige of the narratable" (Brooks 155)

"If the wretched of the earth are [Eugène] Sue's preferred subject, it may be first of all because, for a bourgeois public at least, they are eminently the stuff of plotted story" (Brooks 156)

"the prostitute is pre-eminently someone with a novelistic destiny" (Brooks 156)

"It may be significant that the publication of _Les Mystères de Paris_ in the _Journal des Débats_ ended, following Fleur-de-Marie's death at Gerolstein, with an open letter from Sue to the paper's editor-in-chief, drawing the attention of readers to a new periodical, _La Ruche Populaire_, written and produced exclusively by workers and addressed to their interests, which in its first issue takes its epigraph, concerning the ideal of the 'police of virtue,' and indeed its inspiration, from _Les Mystères de Paris_.  Sue, that is, closes his *novel* with announcement of a *newspaper* that will continue his work; and he ends his letter to the editor by recapitulating a four-point legislative program aimed toward the relief of social misery.  The novel passes on into the world of the readers, whom it has defined and who have defined it, becoming part of the movement toward reform and social justice, putting itself at the service of a political world discovered by way of the melodramatic fiction" (Brooks 166-67)

"[Wilkie] Collins's representations of readers and writers constantly scribbling and constantly reading one another, even when they weren't meant to, suggests an image of the popular serial novel as a prelapsarian age of unlimited storytelling and the unlimited consumption of story: a world in which narrative, whatever the subject, enormously mattered.  Yet, of course, the age of the popular serial novel was tied firmly to the new industrial means and modes of production and distribution, to the devouring presses that it had to feed.  With the vastly increased circulation of fact goes a similarly multiplied circulation of fiction.  The middle decades of the nineteenth century seemed to have an unlimited appetite for narrative" (Brooks 170)

## 7. Retrospective Lust, of Flaubert's Perversities

Flaubert's _L'Education sentimentale_

"Novels, [Jonathan] Culler says, tend to offer us 'paradigms of organization' which invite us to 'read our own lives as novels'" (Brooks 177)

"What is at stake, then, is the traditional readability of the novelistic text.  The world of _L'Education sentimentale_ is not invested with the coherence and significance traditionally conferred on it by the protagonist's desiring.  Furthermore, past, present, and future are not held together by the temporal bonding created by scenarios of desire, seeking realization of its objects -- themselves often a creation of the past -- in a conceived future.  Hence the relation of the protagonist to his world and to plotting has been radically altered from the Balzacian model.  As a result, the reader's relation to the protagonist, and to the novel itself, has also undergone a profound change.  No longer can the reader espouse the protagonist's desire, no longer can he read in the forward-moving expectation created by the force of that desire.  The binding, totalizing work of Eros seems to have reached a halt" (Brooks 178)

"The novel ends with Frédéric and Deslauriers conferring special privilege on a moment that does not fall within the normal chronology of the novel, a moment presented at the very end that in fact predates the beginning.  This striking analepsis, prefigurative of such a later novelist as Faulkner, seems to say that everything we have read in this very long novel is somehow secondary to the unrecorded moment of three years before it began.  It is as if the novel suddenly discovers that it began too late, that the *sjuzet* started out without knowing or accounting for an essential moment of the *fabula* -- as if we had all along been reading a detective story that only at the end leads us to its essential clue, and an unfair detective story, in that it gave us no way of knowing that the essential clue really lay outside the time frame it originally established; or as if we were in one of Freud's case histories, where it transpires that all that has been remembered must be conceived as a screen memory, masking the real scene of trauma, which comes out only at the end.  Closure here also uncloses, suggesting that novels, like analyses, may in essence be interminable" (Brooks 211-12)

## 8. Narrative Transaction and Transference

"The shapes taken by stories and the reasons for their telling suggest the need to explore more fully the narrative sigutation -- narrative *in situation* between teller and listener -- and the kinds of reaction and understanding that narratives appear to want to elicit.  All storytelling, Roland Barthes maintains, is contractual:  it asks for something in return for what it supplies" (Brooks 216)

"Our exploration of narrative in the situation of its telling and its listening has led to the sketch of a transferential model of the text that seems to me pertinent and even crucial to the description of narrative as a process of dynamic exchange.  For it is impotant to consider not only what a narrative is, but what it is for, and what its stakes are:  why it is told, what aims it may manifest and conceal, what it seeks not only to say but to do" (Brooks 235-36)

## 9. An Unreadable Report: Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_

"We need now to consider a number of the issues we have raised, concerning endings, authority, repetition, and the transaction of narratives, in the context of the 'crisis' in the understanding of plots and plotting brought by the advent of Modernism" (Brooks 238)

frame structure and narrative layerings in _Heart of Darkness_; each retelling is required because of the failures of previous tellings

## 10. Fictions of the Wolf Man: Freud and Narrative Understanding

"Like the two great representative novels of European Modernism that I have evoked [Mann's _The Magic Mountain_ and Proust's _Recherche_], the story of the Wolf Man contains within it the outline of a 'standard' nineteenth-century narrative -- the story of a coherent individual in society and within history -- yet, again like these novels, so complicated and undermined by the process of its telling that the apparent premises of the nineteenth-century narrrative mode are put into question.  In a manner yet more radical than Mann's or even Proust's -- perhaps more nearly approaching Faulkner's -- Freud's case history involves a new questioning of how life stories go together, how narrative units combine in significant sequence, where cause and effect are to be sought, and how meaning is related to narration" (Brooks 268)

## 11. Incredulous Narration: _Absalom, Absalom!_

"We need to ask three straightforward, quite naive questions:  What do they recount?  How do they know it?  What is their motive, their investment in what they recount?" (Brooks 297)

## In Conclusion: Endgames and the Study of Plot

"Any closure to our subject would be artificially imposed:  the story of plot may be interminable, the examples calling for attention are legion, and any terminus reached suggests the need for a revisionary epilogue, another perspective, a different narrative" (Brooks 313)

"This tenuous, fictive, arbitrary status of ends clearly speaks to and speaks of an altered situation of plot [in the postmodern], which no longer wishes to be seen as end-determined, moving toward full predication of the narrative sentence, claiming a final plenitude of meaning.  We have, in a sense, become too sophisticated as readers of plot quite to believe in its orderings.  Part of our sophistication no doubt has to do with the cinema, a form that is consubstantial with temporal successiveness and has made the syntax of plot so available it seems to offer no further challenges" (Brooks 314)
