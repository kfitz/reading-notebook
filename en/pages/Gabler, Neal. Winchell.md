Gabler, Neal.  Winchell: Gossip, Power, and the Culture of Celebrity.  New York: Knopf, 1994.


Winchell as “arguably one of the principal architects of [American] culture” (Gabler xi)

“But he did not just invent the modern gossip column.  He became an opinion-maker largely because he understood, as no one else then seemed to, the bitter subtext of the gossip he purveyed.” (Gabler xii-xiii) — gossip as weapon of empowerment against rich and famous

Winchell eventually lost reputation as populist; became remembered as megalomaniac — “It would stick, in part, because of the public’s own ambivalence toward the culture of celebrity, even as the culture continues to flourish.” (Gabler xiv)

“Winchell’s life became a paradigm of what one might call the tragedy of celebrity.  He lived by fame and died by neglect.” (Gabler xv)

“few lives are more instructive of the forces that shaped mass culture in America than Walter Winchell’s.  Because he changed American journalism, examining his life enables us to understand better the evolution of media in this century.  Because he both effected and symbolized the changing of the cultural guard in this century, examining his life enables us to understand better the challenge that mass culture issued to high culture in America.  Because he helped to create a culture of celebrity, examining his life enables us to understand better the symbiotic relationship between the public and the famous.” (Gabler xv)

vaudeville as fundamental influence on Winchell’s message

revolt of twenties: both smart set hedonism and uprising of working classes against boredom

“Walter Lippmann in Public Opinion believed that in a world as vast as ours, one in which events could no longer be directly apprehended by the public, the ordinary citizenry would not be well informed, dispassionate and rational, and he concluded that public opinion could be managed only by a ‘specialized class,’ a kind of intellectual aristocracy.” (Gabler 48)

Winchell and the rise of the tabloids — 1st modern American tabloid: Illustrated Daily News (1919); tabloids rapidly attracted 40% of NY readership; journalistic (and moralistic) opposition to tabloids; realization that the function of the tabloids was not to dispense news, but to entertain; affinity between tabloids and movies

rise of gossip due to transformation of America from a community into a society?

rise of cafe society in the 20s and 30s; columnists able to make socialites famous; rise of the celebrity well-known for being famous

Lindbergh trial as “the first trial to be covered by the full panoply of national media, Hauptmann’s prosecution was a milestone in the culture.  Thereafter, the media would be as much participants in an event as reporters of it, shaping and sensationalizing on a new scale and turning events into occasions, national festivals.” (Gabler 213)

“Journalistic traditionalists, who had earlier decried his gossip, now despaired over what his acceptance as a news commentator said about America’s changing media culture.  Though no one could ever know for certain, what it may have said was that many American in the Depression had become distrustful of traditional authority and even traditional modes of understanding, both of which Winchell’s broadcast directly challenged.” (Gabler 217)

“Long after the gossip column itself had yielded to other, larger and more pervasive vehicles of celebrity, this legacy remained.  We would believe in our entitlement to know everything about our public figures.  We would believe that fame is an exalted state but suspect that the most famous always have something to hide.  Above all, we would believe in a culture of gossip and celebrity where entertainment takes primacy over every other value.  We would believe long after Walter Winchell, the man who had helped start it all, had been forgotten, another name on the ash heap of celebrity.” (Gabler 553)
