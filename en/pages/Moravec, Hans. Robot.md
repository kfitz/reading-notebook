1.  Escape Velocity

cultural evolution takes place much too quickly for biology to keep up; we now have computer-age technology and stone-age biology

tensions created by this situation call either for a rollback of culture (impossible) or an advance in biology (?)

potential new form of existence:  Mind

“Every technical step toward intelligent robots has a rough evolutionary counterpart, and each is likely to benefit its creators, manufacturers, and users.  Each advance will provide intellectual rewards, competitive advantages, and increased wealth and options of all kinds.  Each can make the world a nicer place to live.  At the same time, by performing better and cheaper, the robots will displace humans from essential roles.  Rather quickly, they could displace us from existence.  I’m not as alarmed as many by the latter possibility, since I consider these future machines our progeny, ‘mind children’ built in our image and likeness, ourselves in more potent form.” (Moravec 13)

2.  Caution!  Robot Vehicle!

history of robot development; cybernetics, Turing’s universal machine, AI

possibilities for robot life will require perception and action, both easy for humans but impossible for computers; also “common sense”

problems in designing mobile robots; perception devices, instructions-per-second, etc.

3.  Power and Presence

small computers can best humans at calculation, but a “monstrous” computer would be required to best humans at perception, motion, and socialization

development of OCR and speech-recognition programs required learning

100 million MIPS required to match human functioning; increasing speed of technological developments

Deep Blue v. Kasparov; implications of chess-playing machine

Turing test, and Turing’s nine objections to the thinking machine:  the theological objection; the ‘heads in the sand’ objection; the mathematical objection; the argument from consciousness; arguments from various disabilities; Lady Lovelace’s objection; the argument from continuity in the nervous system; the argument from informality of behavior; the argument from extrasensory perception

“Intelligent machines may incite instinctive fear and anger by resembling ancestral threats — another tribe poaching in our territory, a rival for our social position, or a predator abducting our offspring.” (Moravec 77)

4.  Universal Robots

four generations of projected robot development, moving from perception, manipulation, and mobility to accommodation learning, to world modeling, to reasoning

“the idea of machinery with a conscious mental inner life frightens or enrages some people — an understandable visceral reaction, as the concept clashes with a deep primordial view of the nature of things” (Moravec 111)

sees a fundamental opposition between “life” and “death” and places inanimate matter in the category of the dead; also argues that animate machines have existed for centuries

relies on programming to make sure that robots are loyal (but didn’t he just say in the last chapter that programming is never full control?) and relies on the dynamics of the market to ensure that the robots that proliferate are “good”:  “Robot models that please the customer will be recommended for future purchases, and manufacturers that make customer-pleasing robots will do well, and so ‘nice’ robots will be made in increasing numbers.  Surly or treacherous robots, on the other hand, will probably sell poorly and so will disappear, perhaps taking their manufacturers with them to extinction.” (Moravec 119) — but if these robots are really “treacherous,” and if in the fourth generation they have reasoning ability, and thus something that resembles consciousness, what’s to prevent the treacherous robots from making more of themselves?

5.  The Age of Robots

predicts the end of capitalism, and the “retirement” of the human race as all labor shifts to robots

questions of robots’ legal status:  “Some debate is inevitable, but there should be few qualms about keeping even very superior thinking machines in disenfranchised bondage.” (Moravec 139) — but he’s spent all this time trying to persuade us that machines will eventually be “alive”; how can we keep thinking, feeling, reasoning, conscious machines as slaves?

argues for the installation of Asimov’s “laws of robotics”

first book, Mind Children, speculated on transporting human consciousness to machines

there comes a point in this chapter when you’re completely convinced that Moravec has utterly lost his mind…

6.  The Age of Mind

Yes, definitely lost his mind.

Projects that robots/ex-humans will abandon the physical realm for the quantum, and thus will disappear, becoming pure cyberintelligences

time travel and its potential for quantum computing

7.  Mind Fire

simulations

“Potential plagues of angry demons surely count as a moral consequence.” (Moravec 199)
