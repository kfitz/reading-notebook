Butler, Judith.  Gender Trouble:  Feminism and the Subversion of Identity.  New York:  Routledge, 1999.

Preface (1999).

"most concerned to criticize a pervasive heterosexual assumption in feminist literary theory" (vii)

"Gender Trouble sought to uncover the ways in which the very thinking of what is possible in gendered life is foreclosed by certain habitual and violent presumptions." (viii)

"my point was not to 'apply' poststructuralism to feminism, but to subject those theories to a specifically feminist reformulation" (ix)

convergence of cultural studies and critical theory:  "the emergence of theory at the site where cultural horizons meet, where the demand for translation is acute and its promise of success, uncertain" (ix)

"Gender Trouble sought to refuse the notion that lesbian practice instantiates feminist theory, and set up a more troubled relation between the two terms.  Lesbianism in this text does not represent a return to what is most important about being a woman; it does not consecrate femininity or signal a gynocentric world.  Lesbianism is not the erotic consummation of a set of political beliefs….  Instead, the text asks, how do non-normative sexual practices call into question the stability of gender as a category of analysis?  How do certain sexual practices compel the question: what is a woman, what is a man?" (x-xi)

Gayle Rubin's "The Traffic in Women" — "normative sexuality fortifies normative gender.  Briefly, one is a woman, according to this framework, to the extent that one functions as one within the dominant heterosexual frame and to call the frame into question is perhaps to lose something of one's sense of place in gender." (xi)

"This constitutes a certain crisis in ontology experienced at the level of both sexuality and language." (xi)

contrasts explanation of link between gender and sexuality with that posited by Catharine MacKinnon; "Certainly, I do not mean to claim that forms of sexual practice produce certain genders, but only that under conditions of normative heterosexuality, policing gender is sometimes used as a way of securing heterosexuality." (xii)

"To what extent does gender hierarchy serve a more or less compulsory heterosexuality, and how often are gender norms policed precisely in the service of shoring up heterosexual hegemony?" (xii)

queer theorists' distinctions between sexuality and gender:  "if what is meant by this distinction is that heterosexual normativity ought not to order gender, and that such ordering ought to be opposed, I am firmly in favor of this view.  If, however, what is meant by this is that (descriptively speaking), there is no sexual regulation of gender, then I think an important, but not exclusive, dimension of how homophobia works is going unrecognized by those who are clearly most eager to combat it." (xiv)

the theory of performativity:  "revolves around this metalepsis, the way in which the anticipation of a gendered essence produces that which it posits as outside itself.  Secondly, performativity is not a singular act, but a repetition and a ritual, which achieves its effects through its naturalization in the context of a body, understood, in part, as a culturally sustained temporal duration." (xiv-xv)

"The view that gender is performative sought to show that what we take to be an internal essence of gender is manufactured through a sustained set of acts, posited through the gendered stylization of the body." (xv)

race and performativity — cannot be understood via simple analogy with gender

production of text within both academic and social movement circles

concerns about assertion of "universality" revised by acknowledgement that the universal can have strategic use, and "can be proleptic and performative, conjuring a reality that does not yet exist, and holding out the possibility for a convergence of cultural horizons that have not yet met." (xvii-xviii)

difficulty of style:  "Are those who are offended making a legitimate request for 'plain speaking' or does their complaint emerge from a consumer expectation of intellectual life?  Is there, perhaps, a value to be derived from such experiences of linguistic difficulty?" (xix)

"What travels under the sign of 'clarity,' and what would be the price of failing to deploy a certain critical suspicion when the arrival of lucidity is announced?  Who devises the protocols of 'clarity' and whose interests do they serve?" (xix)

"The dogged effort to 'denaturalize' gender in this text emerges, I think, from a strong desire both to counter the normative violence implied by ideal morphologies of sex and to uproot the pervasive assumptions about natural or presumptive heterosexuality that are informed by ordinary and academic discourses on sexuality." (xx)

is there a normative or prescriptive element to the book's discussion of sexuality?

"subversive performances always run the risk of becoming deadening clichés through their repetition and, most importantly, through their repetition within commodity culture where 'subversion' carries market value." (xxi)

"What continues to concern me most is the following kinds of questions:  what will and will not constitute an intelligible life, and how do presumptions about normative gender and sexuality determine in advance what will qualify as the 'human' and the 'livable'?  In other words, how do normative gender presumptions work to delimit the very field of description that we have for the human?" (xxii)

"When such categories [as man and woman] come into question, the reality of gender is also put into crisis: it becomes unclear how to distinguish the real from the unreal…. Although this insight does not in itself constitute a political revolution, no political revolution is possible without a radical shift in one's notion of the possible and the real." (xxiii)

"If there is a positive normative task in Gender Trouble, it is to insist upon the extension of this legitimacy to bodies that have been regarded as false, unreal, and unintelligible." (xxiii)

connections of the performative to theories of agency

"Gender Trouble sometimes reads as if gender is simply a self-invention or that the psychic meaning of a gendered presentation might be read directly off its surface…. Moreover, my theory sometimes waffles between understanding performativity as linguistic and casting it as theatrical.  I have come to think that the two are invariably related, chiasmically so, and that a reconsideration of the speech act as an instance of power invariably draws attention to both its theatrical and linguistic dimensions." (xxv)

Preface (1990).

sense of trouble in feminist debates over the meaning of gender; making trouble can get you in trouble; the feminine as trouble

"What happens to the subject and to the stability of gender categories when the epistemic regime of presumptive heterosexuality is unmasked as that which produces and reifies these ostensible categories of ontology? / But how can an epistemic/ontological regime be brought into question?  What best way to trouble the gender categories that support gender hierarchy and compulsory heterosexuality?" (xxviii)

"Is drag the imitation of gender, or does it dramatize the signifying gestures through which gender itself is established?" (xxviii)

"gender practices within gay and lesbian cultures often thematize 'the natural' in parodic contexts that bring into relief the performative construction of an original and true sex.  What other foundational categories of identity — the binary of sex, gender, and the body — can be shown as productions that create the effect of the natural, the original, and the inevitable?" (xxix)

Foucauldian genealogy "refuses to search for the origins of gender, the inner truth of female desire, a genuine or authentic sexual identity that repression has kept from view; rather genealogy investigates the political stakes in designating as a origin and cause those identity categories that are in fact the effects of institutions, practices, discourses with multiple and diffuse points of origin." (xxix)

"it is no longer clear that feminist theory ought to try to settle the questions of primary identity in order to get on with the task of politics.  Instead, we ought to ask, what political possibilities are the consequence of a radical critique of the categories of identity." (xxix)

1.  Subjects of Sex/Gender/Desire
I.  "Women" as the Subject of Feminism

"For the most part, feminist theory has assumed that there is some existing identity, understood through the category of women, who not only initiates feminist interests and goals within discourse, but constitutes the subject for whom political representation is pursued." (3)

"For feminist theory, the development of a language that fully or adequately represents women has seemed necessary to foster the political visibility of women." (4)

the dual problem of the subject and its representation

"Foucault points out that juridical systems of power produce the subjects they subsequently come to represent…. If this analysis is right, then the juridical formation of language and politics that represents women as 'the subject' of feminism is itself a discursive formation and effect of a given version of representational politics.  And the feminist subject turns out to be discursively constituted by the very political system that is supposed to facilitate its emancipation." (4)

"the political construction of the subject proceeds with certain legitimating and exclusionary aims, and these political operations are effectively concealed and naturalized by a political analysis that takes juridical structures as their foundation." (5)

feminist critique must wrestle with the production of the category of "women"

"Apart from the foundationalist fictions that support the notion of the subject, however, there is the political problem that feminism encounters in the assumption that the term women denotes a common identity….  If one 'is' a woman, that is surely not all one is; the term fails to be exhaustive, not because a pregendered 'person' transcends the specific paraphernalia of its gender, but because gender is not always constituted coherently or consistently in different historical contexts, and because gender intersects with racial, class, ethnic, sexual, and regional modalities of discursively constructed identities." (6)

presumed universality both of the subject of feminism and of patriarchy both undermined by the exclusions that the construction of subjectivity necessitates, revealing "the coercive and regulatory consequences of that construction, even when the construction has been elaborated for emancipatory purposes." (7)

"it may be time to entertain a radical critique that seeks to free feminist theory from the necessity of having to construct a single or abiding ground which is invariably contested by those identity positions or anti-identity positions that it invariably excludes." (8)
II.  The Compulsory Order of Sex/Gender/Desire

sex/gender split:  "Originally intended to dispute the biology-is-destiny formulation, the distinction between sex and gender serves the argument that whatever biological intractability sex appears to have, gender is culturally constructed:  hence, gender is neither the causal result of sex nor as seemingly fixed as sex." (9-10)

but the split also suggests that there should be no particular alignment between sexed bodies and constructed genders, and no reason why sexual dimorphism (a problematic notion) should lead to a binary gender

"If the immutable character of sex is contested, perhaps this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all." (10-11)

"Gender ought not to be conceived merely as the cultural inscription of meaning on a pregiven sex (a juridical conception); gender must also designate the very apparatus of production whereby the sexes themselves are established.  As a result, gender is not to culture as sex is to nature; gender is also the discursive/ cultural means by which 'sexed nature' or 'a natural sex' is produced and established as 'prediscursive,' prior to culture, a political neutral surface on which culture acts." (11)
III.  Gender:  The Circular Ruins of Contemporary Debate

is gender something one has or something one is?  is construction a matter of free will or a matter of determinism?

"The limits of the discursive analysis of gender presuppose and preempt the possibilities of imaginable and realizable gender configurations within culture." (13)

Irigaray:  women as unrepresentable within phallogocentric language

"For Irigaray, the female sex is not a 'lack' or an 'Other' that immanently and negatively defines the subject in its masculinity.  On the contrary, the female sex eludes the very requirements of representation, for she is neither 'Other' nor the 'lack,' those categories remaining relative to the Sartrian subject, immanent to that phallogocentric scheme." (15)

disagreements about meaning of gender suggests need for radical rethinking of categories of identity
IV.  Theorizing the Binary, the Unitary, and Beyond

Irigaray's analysis undercut by her globalizing strategy; "That the tactic can operate in feminist and antifeminist contexts alike suggests that the colonizing gesture is not primarily or irreducibly masculinist.  It can operate to effect other relations of racial, class, and heterosexist subordination, to name but a few." (19)

problematics of coalitional "unity" — need for open coalition
V.  Identity, Sex, and the Metaphysics of Substance

"It would be wrong to think that the discussion of 'identity' ought to proceed prior to a discussion of gender identity for the simple reason that 'persons' only become intelligible through becoming gendered in conformity with recognizable standards of gender intelligibility." (22)

is "identity" normative rather than descriptive?  "In other words, the 'coherence' and 'continuity' of 'the person' are not logical or analytical features of personhood, but, rather, socially instituted and maintained norms of intelligibility." (23)

" 'Intelligible' genders are those which in some sense institute and maintain relations of coherence and continuity among sex, gender, sexual practice, and desire." (23)

disordering practices of "unintelligible" gender identities

appearance of "sex" as a substance within hegemonic language "is achieved through a performative twist of language and/or discourse that conceals the fact that 'being' a sex or a gender is fundamentally impossible." (25)

"metaphysical unity" of sex, gender and desire in compulsory heterosexuality (30)

"In this sense, gender is not a noun, but neither is it a set of free-floating attributes, for we have seen that the substantive effect of gender is performatively produced and compelled by the regulatory practices of gender coherence.  Hence within the inherited discourse of the metaphysics of substance, gender proves to be performative — that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be.  In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to preexist the deed." (33)
VI.  Language, Power, and the Strategies of Displacement

"Whereas Irigaray seeks to expose the ostensible 'binary' relation between the sexes as a masculinist ruse that excludes the feminine altogether, Wittig argues that positions like Irigaray's reconsolidate the binary between masculine and feminine and recirculate a mythic notion of the feminine." (35)

"If sexuality is culturally constructed within existing power relations, then the postulation of a normative sexuality that is 'before,' 'outside,' or 'beyond' power is a cultural impossibility as a politically impractical dream, one that postpones the concrete and contemporary task of rethinking subversive possibilities for sexuality and identity within the terms of power itself." (40)

"The replication of heterosexual constructs in non-heterosexual frames brings into relief the utterly constructed status of the so-called heterosexual original.  Thus, gay is to straight not as copy is to original, but, rather, as copy is to copy." (41)

2.  Prohibition, Psychoanalysis, and the Production of the Heterosexual Matrix

interest of feminist theory in origins of patriarchy seeking some primordial moment before its institution — but universalized patriarchy in reductive, colonialist ways

also, "The postulation of the 'before' within feminist theory becomes politically problematic when it constrains the future to materialize an idealized notion of the past or when it supports, even inadvertently, the reification of a precultural sphere of the authentic feminine." (46)

structuralist nature/culture binary used to elucidate sex/gender distinction — turns sex into "raw" and gender into "cooked," ignoring poststructuralism's lessons about the cultural status of "nature" (and thus the constructedness of "sex")
I.  Structuralism's Critical Exchange

universal structures of kinship posited by structuralism are underwritten by the exchange of women

"the bride functions as a relational term between groups of men; she does not have an identity, and neither does she exchange one identity for another.  She reflects masculine identity precisely through being the site of its absence." (50)

"In effect, the relations among patrilineal clans are based in homosocial desire (what Irigaray punningly calls "hommo-sexuality"), a repressed and, hence, disparaged sexuality, a relationship between men which is, finally, about the bonds of men, but which takes place through the heterosexual exchange and distribution of women." (52)

incest as fantasy for Levi-Strauss:  "That the prohibition exists in no way suggests that it works.  Rather, its existence appears to suggest that desires, actions, indeed, pervasive social practices of incest are generated precisely in virtue of the eroticization of that taboo." (54)
II.  Lacan, Riviere, and the Strategies of Masquerade

Lacanian distinction between "having" the Phallus (men) and "being" the Phallus (paradoxically, women)

femininity, feminine sexuality, female homosexuality, and the masquerade

"Lacanian theory must be understood as a kind of 'slave morality.'  How would Lacanian theory be reformulated after the appropriation of Nietzsche's insight in On the Genealogy of Morals that God, the inaccessible Symbolic, is rendered inaccessible by a power (the will-to-power) that regularly institutes its own powerlessness?" (72-73)
III.  Freud and the Melancholia of Gender

role of melancholy in the acquisition of gender identity in Freudian psych.

"The conceptualization of bisexuality in terms of dispositions, feminine and masculine, which have heterosexual aims as their intentional correlates, suggests that for Freud, bisexuality is the coincidence of two heterosexual desires within a single psyche." (77)

taboo against homosexuality must precede taboo against heterosexual incest; "Hence, the dispositions that Freud assumes to be primary or constitutive facts of sexual life are effects of a law which, internalized, produces and regulates discrete gender identity and heterosexuality." (82)
IV.  Gender Complexity and the Limits of Identification

incorporation as fantasy (fantasy of internality)?

"The loss of the heterosexual object, argues Freud, results in the displacement of that object, but not the heterosexual aim; on the other hand, the loss of the homosexual object requires the loss of the aim and the object.  In other words, the object is not only lost, but the desire fully denied" (88)

"heterosexual melancholy is culturally instituted and maintained as the price of stable gender identities related through oppositional desires" (89)

"The disavowed homosexuality at the base of melancholic heterosexuality reemerges as the self-evident anatomical facticity of sex, where 'sex' designates the blurred unity of anatomy, 'natural identity,' and 'natural desire.'" (91)

"the woman-as-object must be the sign that he not only never felt homosexual desire, but never felt the grief over its loss.  Indeed, the woman-as-sign must effectively displace and conceal that preheterosexual history in favor of one that consecrates a seamless heterosexuality." (91)
V.  Reformulating Prohibition as Power

"if we apply the Foucaultian critique of the repressive hypothesis to the incest taboo, that paradigmatic law of repression, then it would appear that the law produces both sanctioned heterosexuality and transgressive homosexuality.  Both are indeed effects, temporally and ontologically later than the law itself, and the illusion of a sexuality before the law is itself the creation of that law." (94)

3.  Subversive Bodily Acts
I.  The Body Politics of Julia Kristeva

"Despite her critique of Lacan, however, Kristeva's strategy of subversion proves doubtful.  Her theory appears to depend upon the stability and reproduction of precisely the paternal law that she seeks to displace.  Although she effectively exposes the limits of Lacan's efforts to universalize the paternal law in language, she nevertheless concedes that the semiotic is invariably subordinate to the Symbolic, that it assumes its specificity within the terms of a hierarchy immune to challenge." (102)

"The body gains meaning within discourse only in the context of power relations.  Sexuality is an historically specific organization of power, discourse, bodies, and affectivity.  As such, sexuality is understood by Foucault to produce 'sex' as an artificial concept which effectively extends and disguises the power relations responsible for its genesis." (117)

"In order to avoid the emancipation of the oppressor in the name of the oppressed, it is necessary to take into account the full complexity and subtlety of the law and to cure ourselves of the illusion of a true body beyond the law.  If subversion is possible, it will be a subversion from within the terms of the law, through the possibilities that emerge when the law turns against itself and spawns unexpected permutations of itself." (119)
II.  Foucault, Herculine, and the Politics of Sexual Discontinuity

contradiction between History of Sexuality and introduction to Herculine ms. — is there any emancipatory sexuality?  is there any sexuality before the law?

"Herculine's anatomy does not fall outside the categories of sex, but confuses and redistributes the constitutive elements of those categories; indeed, the free play of attributes has the effect of exposing the illusory character of sex as an abiding substance substrate to which these various attributes are presumed to adhere." (128)

a "Concluding Unscientific Postscript" on current biological research into the chromosomal/genetic binary switch that produces gender — fails to account for anomalies

"The point here is not to seek recourse to the exceptions, the bizarre, in order merely to relativize the claims made in behalf of normal sexual life.  As Freud suggests in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, however, it is the exception, the strange, that gives us the clue to how the mundane and taken-for-granted world of sexual meanings is constituted." (140)
III.  Monique Wittig:  Bodily Disintegration and Fictive Sex

"Those bodily figures who do not fit into either gender fall outside the human, indeed, constitute the domain of the dehumanized and the abject against which the human itself is constituted." (142)

Beavoir/Wittig's claim that one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman:  "if gender is something that one becomes — but can never be — then gender is itself a kind of becoming or activity, and that gender ought not to be conceived as a noun or a substantial thing or a static cultural marker, but rather as an incessant and repeated action of some sort." (143)

Wittig's additional claims:  "that the category of sex is neither invariant nor natural, but is a specifically political use of the category of nature that serves the purposes of reproductive sexuality" and that "a lesbian is not a woman.  A woman, she argues, only exists as a term that stabilizes and consolidates a binary and oppositional relation to a man; that relation, she argues, is heterosexuality." (143)

"The 'naming' of sex is an act of domination and compulsion, an institutionalized performative that both creates and legislates social reality by requiring the discursive/perceptual construction of bodies in accord with principles of social difference." (147)

ability of language (via concepts, categories) to effect a material violence on bodies

for Wittig, the only revolutionary stance is homosexuality; sees all heterosexuality as compulsive and oppressive

"My own conviction is that the radical disjunction posited by Wittig between heterosexuality and homosexuality is simply not true, that there are structures of psychic homosexuality within heterosexual relations, and structures of psychic heterosexuality within gay and lesbian sexuality and relationships.  Further, there are other power/discourse centers that construct and structure both gay and straight sexuality; heterosexuality is not the only compulsory display of power that informs sexuality." (155)

heterosexuality, in its creation of impossible norms, as "not only a compulsory law, but … an inevitable comedy" (155)

"in my view, the normative focus for gay and lesbian practice ought to be on the subversive and parodic redeployment of power rather than on the impossible fantasy of its full-scale transcendence." (158)

"If to become a lesbian is an act, a leave-taking of heterosexuality, a self-naming that contests the compulsory meanings of heterosexuality's women and men, what is to keep the name of lesbian from becoming an equally compulsory category?… if it is an 'act' that founds the identity as a performative accomplishment of sexuality, are there certain kinds of acts that qualify over others as foundational?  Can one do the act with a 'straight mind'?" (162)
IV.  Bodily Inscriptions, Performative Subversions

"Is 'the body' or 'the sexed body' the firm foundation on which gender and systems of compulsory sexuality operate?  Or is 'the body' itself shaped by political forces with strategic interests in keeping that body bounded and constituted by the markers of sex?" (164)

a final section entitled "From Interiority to Gender Performatives": challenging language of internalization; "acts, gestures, and desire produce the effect of an internal core or substance, but produce this on the surface of the body, through the play of signifying absences that suggest, but never reveal, the organizing principle of identity as a cause.  Such acts, gestures, enactments, generally construed, are performative in the sense that the essence or identity that they otherwise purport to express are fabrications manufactured and sustained through corporeal signs and other discursive means." (173)

feminist theory's arguments against drag — that if degrades women through a reification of sexual stereotypes — ignores that "In imitating gender, drag implicitly reveals the imitative structure of gender itself — as well as its contingency." (175)

"If gender attributes and acts, the various ways in which a body shows or produces its cultural signification, are performative, then there is no preexisting identity by which an act or attribute might be measured; there would be no true or false, real or distorted acts of gender, and the postulation of a true gender identity would be revealed as a regulatory fiction." (180)

Conclusion:  From Parody to Politics

"The foundationalist reasoning of identity politics tends to assume that an identity must first be in place in order for political interests to be elaborated and, subsequently, political action to be taken.  My argument is that there need not be a 'doer behind the deed,' but that the 'doer' is variably constructed in and through the deed." (181)

import of gender as signifying practices:  "In a sense, all signification takes place within the orbit of the compulsion to repeat; 'agency,' then, is to be located within the possibility of a variation on that repetition." (185)

"The deconstruction of identity is not the deconstruction of politics; rather, it establishes as political the very terms through which identity is articulated." (189)
