## 1. Humanities to Digital Humanities

"the Digital Humanities has greatly expanded the potential power and reach of the humanities disciplines, both within the academy, and, just as importantly, outside its walls" (4)

volume understands the humanities (in their traditional manifestations) as seeking "to define culture and help us gain a greater understanding of the human experience" (4)

issue of empiricism vs subjectivity, interpretation, judgment in humanistic study

emphasis on "the implications of design, and specifically design for transmedia modes of argumentation, as a model for contemporary work" (4) -- sure, absolutely: but should this text then claim to focus on "design and the digital humanities" rather than "the digital humanities" tout court?

new methodologies and approaches combine to create what they call "the Generative Humanities, a mode of practice that depends on rapid cycles of prototyping and testing, a willingness to embrace productive failure, and the realization that any 'solutions' generated within the Digital Humanities will spawn new 'problems' -- and that this is all to the good" (5)

early instantiations of humanism involved the capture of classical and medieval texts in the newly emerging form of print

"By the second half of the 19th century, with industrialization in full swing and the building of public school systems and public universities underway in Europe and the United States, the humanities began to assume their contemporary guise. This is the era in which the study of literature, philosophy, and classics was split off from the natural and physical sciences, even as 'history' and the historical disciplines came to be understood as expressions of Wissenschaft in the double sense of a 'science' and a discipline endowed with a distinctive toolkit for grappling with the cultural record." (6)

"modern concepts of humanistic knowledge were built on authoring, narrative, and textual models specific to the medium of print, with the monograph gradually supplanting commentaries and critical editions as the inviolable touchstone of scholarly knowledge and achievement" (7)

"By the mid-20th century, the modern research university assumed its present form, with segmented humanities departments separated from the natural and social sciences as well as from vocational and professional schools. Digital work challenges many of these separations, promoting dialogue not only across established disciplinary lines but also across the pure/applied, qualitative/quantitative, and theoretical/practical divides" (7)

in digital humanities we see rise of new modes of argumentation and resurgence of older modes: new or resurgent interest in voice, performance, visual, aural, spatial, etc.; combination of such forms leads to heightened significance of design in DH work

significance of transmedia argumentation: "The visual does not necessarily represent an advance over the capabilities of text. It is simply a different, distinct medium for thinking, communicating, and working, with its own rigors and histories, its own skill-sets and language, and its own freedoms and constraints" (11)

significance of design in digital work, including interaction design, information hierarchies, rhetorical schema, etc; "All forms of design share a propositional orientation that is well-suited to the challenges that come with designing new structures, for design asks 'What if?' Each design iteration plays out an answer to the question 'What happens when…?'" (12)

"Digital humanists have much to learn from communication and media design about how to juxtapose and integrate words and images, create hierarchies of reading, forge pathways of understanding, deploy grids and templates to best effect, and develop navigational schemata that guide and produce meaningful interactions" (13)

precursors in graphic books: McLuhan & Fiore's The Medium Is the Massage, Berger's Ways of Seeing, McCloud's Understanding Comics 

interplay of text, sound, and image in media: "these techniques are -- as with design -- about more than simply production: They are the means with which to investigate and articulate an idea" (14)

see also the motion graphic or information visualization: Charles and Ray Eames's Powers of Ten 

"The rewritable substrate of digital media enables iterative work to hitherto unprecedented degrees, introducing the software term 'version' into units of scholarly production" (15)

on collaboration: "Technical imagination and expertise partner with discipline-specific forms of knowledge in Digital Humanities projects: projects in which each contributor plays a vital role in setting the research agenda, and in which contributors build big mosaics out of tesserae consisting of specialized skills and expert knowledge." (15)

caveat, however: "The positive demand for expanded skill-sets could have profoundly negative effects on scholarship if it becomes the academic equivalent of a neo-liberal speedup in which ever more quantitative metrics are used to push 'education workers' into acquiring technological skills without commensurate pay, skills which they are then held accountable for, both within and outside of tenure tracks." (15)

"Digital Humanities is an extension of traditional knowledge skills and methods, not a replacement for them." (16)

"The cultural politics of academic institutions are shifting, indeed, but we must be attentive to inadvertent consequences. Projects that are depended on deliverables as their only measure of success are likely to be at odds with a research mission that supports innovation and imaginative, risk-taking work." (16)

root of odd match-up of humanities and computing: "computation depends on disambiguation at every level" (16), while "ambiguity and implicit assumptions are crucial to the humanities" (17). However, each domain is changing the other

"The introduction of structured data for analysis and display in the family of what are known as markup languages added a dimension to this activity, introducing interpretation into the digitized stream of keyboarded characters. The insertion of these 'tags' allowed manipulation of the content and the performance of an interpretive act." (17)

curation, analysis, editing, modeling as core DH activities, supported by "the basic building blocks of digital activity: digitization, classification, description and metadata, organization, and navigation" (17)

"Editing is the creative, imaginative activity of making, and as such, design can also be seen as a kind of editing: It is the means by which an argument takes shape and is given form." (18)

content modeling as the means by which "shape is conferred upon a given set of cultural contents" (19)

"Digital work takes place in the real world, and humanists once accustomed to isolated or individualized modes of production must now grapple with complex partnerships and with insuring the long-term availability and viability of their scholarship." (21)

"one of the strongest attributes of the field is that the iterative versioning of digital projects fosters experimentation, risk-taking, redefinition, and sometimes failure. It is important that we do not short-circuit this experimental process in the rush to normalize practices, standardize methodologies, and define evaluative metrics." (21)

"The methodologies of Digital Humanities are robust precisely because they place lasting pedagogical value in the creative, generative, and experimental processes of design-based research. Process is favored over product; versioning and extensibility are favored over definitive editions and research silos." (22)

"Accepting the psychology of failure is part of the life cycle of innovation. Yet when the academic culture of peer review and promotion runs up against budget realities and resource scarcity, skittishness about failure arises." (22)

relationship of the digital to the opening up of the canon: "Digital, polyvocal expression can support a genuine multiverse in which no single point of view can claim the center. The principles of relativist approaches to knowledge, rooted in historically situated understanding, remain fundamental to (digital) humanism." (24)

also claims to solve the problem of the canon's finitude: "In the eight semesters of the hypothetical student's college career, there are only so many class sessions. But the networked academy's very allatonceness -- to use Marshall McLuhan's suggestive term referring to simultaneity and connectivity -- offers a glimpse of a more elastic notion of curricula, one that extends past the walls of the academy and the time limits of degree programs." (24)

"The best core curricula -- whether or not based on classical models -- strive to create students, and thereby citizens, who think with imagination, who manifest their thoughts as creative action, and whose analysis can lead to inventive, although hardly definitive, syntheses. These are precisely the goals that a digitally drive, generative humanities core espouses." (25)

Yikes: DH "promotes platforms for informed amateur scholarship, and it serves to make humanities research into something of a new multi-player online game with global reach and relevance" (26). I do not at all dispute the benefits of "informed amateur scholarship," but the gamification of scholarship will not sit well. In fact, it does not sit well with me. Must everything be a game to be engaging?

## 2. Emerging Methods and Genres

"We strongly believe that humanists need to apply the same kind of rigorous media-specific, social, cultural, and economic analyses that we have honed to study print culture to understand the specificity and affordances of digital culture and to interrogate the status of knowledge, the concept of culture, and the redefinition of the social in our global information age." (30) --- Absolutely! Except that I don't think that humanists-in-general have those skills with respect to print culture. In fact most treat print as an unquestionable given, or where they are interested in "print culture," profoundly misunderstand its causalities.

"enhanced critical curation": "The accumulation and care of knowledge were paramount within classical, pre-modern, and early modern regimes of data scarcity…. Copiousness and copying were understood as inherently good under such circumstances, and collecting served the project of gathering, conservation, and retrieval." (32)

"new professional figures emerge alongside scholars by the end of the 19th century, entrusted with guardianship over the remains of the past and armed with a battery of scientific and analytical techniques: archivists, museum curators, catalogers and librarians…. two parallel institutional worlds emerge that the digital revolution is reconnecting under transformed circumstances" (33)

"the mere existence of vast quantities of data, artifacts, or products is no guarantee of impact or quality. To curate is to filter, organize, craft, and, ultimately, care for a story composed out of -- even rescued from -- the infinite array of potential tales, relics, and voices." (34)

"augmented editions and fluid textuality": new means of presenting texts (and their histories) as well as processing texts

"scale: the law of large numbers": "We are producing, sharing, consuming, and storing exponentially more cultural material -- including texts, images, audio, and time-based data -- than ever before. We are producing data at a rate that already outstrips our ability to store them and outpaces our ability to catalog, analyze, and archive these data in meaningful ways." (37)

"ever-larger data sets will offer ever-more verifiable conclusions" (37)

"When digital technologies allow for the storage and analysis of millions of books, billions of tweets, and hundreds of billions of interactions, the ways in which we can query and comprehend the cultural record explodes. Concepts, trends, actions, and the flow of human communication come into view at a macro scale." (38)

"we will have to design and employ new tools to thoughtfully and meaningfully sift through, analyze, visualize, map, and evaluate the deluge of data and cultural material that the digital age has unleashed: tasks that will require humanists to contend with text-mining tools, machine reading, and various kinds of algorithmic analyses…. beyond distant reading, the time has come to entertain the possibility of machine reading, in which trends, correlations, and relationships are extracted through computational methods" (38)

on machine reading of the Shoah archive: "There is simply no way we can process and make sense of the volume of cultural data -- including traditional printed materials -- without the help of a computer to process, index, select, and cluster data on a comprehensible scale. But what are the implications of turning Holocaust testimonies into units of data, statistical analyses, and compact visualizations? Does this sort of quantitative analysis not inevitably, or perhaps by definition, subject the victims to further objectification, another dehumanizing process?"

need for digital humanists to "bring together the tools of technological analysis and the values, critical skills, and historical knowledge that animate the humanities disciplines" (39)

"distant/close, macro/micro, surface/depth": key abilities of digital humanists to toggle between views

"cultural analytics, aggregation, and data-mining": "Cultural analytics does not analyze cultural artifacts, but operates on the level of digital models of these materials in aggregate" (41)

aggregation vs composite analysis; "data mining is a term that covers a host of techniques for analyzing digital material by 'parameterizing' some feature of information and extracting it…. To date, much humanities data-mining has merely involved counting. Much more sophisticated statistical methods and use of probability will be needed for humanists to absorb the lessons of the social sciences into their methods" (42)

"visualization and data design": "As digital tools have become prevalent, the interest in 'reading' the visual has extended to 'authoring' the visual -- using visual means to express intellectual concepts. What might it mean to make a visual argument, for instance, or to shape a concept through graphical means?" (42)

"Visualization is intellectually distinct from illustration, the employment of a graphical feature, photograph, map, or other representational device to elucidate, explain, or show something in a text. In the latter case, the text still assumes priority, and the illustration is meant to summarize an argument, provide a reference point, or corroborate the text." Visualizations, by contrast, are "arguments in themselves" (43).

"Visualization has the power to unleash imaginative and conceptual potential. By identifying elements of a system and thinking about how they relate to each other sequentially, or hierarchically, or relationally, humanists discover ways of modeling knowledge that were not part of their textual training." (45)

"locative investigation and thick mapping": "As the contours of scholarship are undergoing a fundamental remapping through collaborations n which researchers can curate, narrate, annotate, and augment physical landscapes, the boundaries of inside and outside have become fluid." (46)

"geographic analysis, digital mapping platforms, and interpretive historical practices come together to form richly textured, multidimensional investigations of place… these practices of thick mapping in the Digital Humanities place a primacy on experiential navigation, epistemologies of representation, and the rhetorics of visualization." (46)

“the animated archive”: new possibilities for archives, including “process-based concepts of ‘living’ archives of the present; approaches to conservation and preservation based upon multiplying (rather than restricting) access to the remains of the past; participatory models of content production, research, and curatorship bringing together professional and citizen scholars in team-based projects that interpret the cultural patrimony as a public good; augmented approaches to programming and informal education that promise to expand traditional library and museum audiences and bring scholarship into public view; and enhanced means for vivifying and promoting active or experientially augmented modes of engagement with both the past and the present.” (47-48)

“This is the future of knowledge, where culture and social and political practice will emphasize embeddings of the virtual within the real, where actual physical landscapes will be curated just as if they were in an art gallery, and where we will be surrounded and enveloped by the collaborative and distributed building of annotations on, and overlays of, the physical world.” (49)

"distributed knowledge production and performative access”: “When knowledge exists in iterative form across global networks and local access points, with many versions and expressions of cultural information taking shape in a process whose life cycle is ongoing, then any access to that knowledge is a performance, an instantiation.” (50)

“humanities gaming”

“code, software, and platform studies”: “The study of code is driven by an interest in exposing the ways constraints make certain things possible, and exclude others. But is code a text? If so, what kind of text? Should we assess the aesthetic properties of code the same way we discern the value of any other artistic composition? Or should we condemn code work as mere craft or technique?” (53)

“database documentaries”: multiple, intersecting storylines; user performed

“repurposable content and remix culture”: “Figuring out how to write texts in a modular manner that will allow them to be recombined for different levels of interest and readership as well as different degrees of detail and granularities of argument (not to mention output and display device) is still a challenge — and represents another fertile field for the Digital Humanities to explore.” (56)

“universities will serve their students best by credentialing the skills necessary to creatively conceptualize and solve problems: a knowledge base grounded in making and experimentation, and a social disposition that fosters collaboration with diverse partners. It is here that the core values of the humanities and the generative potential of the digital come together in the poiesis of world-making.” (57)

“pervasive infrastructure”: cloud computing leads to ability to expose and manipulate remote, enormous data sets

“ubiquitous scholarship”: “marked by an ethic of collaboration and interconnection on levels that move (almost effortlessly) between the global and the local, the library and the public square, the pen and the smartphone, the millennia-long histories of humankind and the real-time feeds of the now” (60)

## 3. The Social Life of the Digital Humanities

changes in the norms of academic life and knowledge production; “how open-source models, information technologies, and social media have reshaped contemporary practice, promoting social transformations that affect the reach and relevance of humanities work” (76)

“we can discern a critical difference between an economy of knowledge production tending towards scarcity, centralized control, hierarchy, division of labor, property, and proprietary systems versus an economy of knowledge production tending towards abundance, decentralization, peer creation, creative commons, and open-source models” (77)

“No clean break exists between these two economies and elements of complexity and contradiction appear within each. But forces are sure to continue to vie for control in an era of (seemingly) seamless networks, open platforms, and global exchange.” (79)

social media technologies have created the possibility of “a global and networked world of decentralized sharing, collaboration, and diffusion, with the caveat that it also creates the conditions for violent backlash and newer forms of surveillance and control” (80)

“since the Digital Humanities studies and explicates what it means to be human in the networked information age, it expands the reach and relevance of the humanities far beyond small groups of specialists locked in hermetically sealed conversation” (82) — or perhaps it has the potential to do so, but the transformation required is not just the addition of the digital, but instead a full rethinking of the humanities

“We no longer imagine authorship as autonomous work or as the labor of a solitary genius (something that, to be sure, critical theory has been chipping away at for decades). Instead we think of the harnessing and expressiveness of the creative energies of an ever-expanding, virtually boundless community of practitioners.” (83) — hmmm.

“Some scholars and artists have published versions of their books online using paragraph-by-paragraph blogging software or other collaborative annotation and commenting engines” (85) — but none of them are important enough to be named here. Sheesh.

“Crowd-sourced evaluations of scholarly arguments, not to mention crowd-sourced production models for generating and editing scholarly content, are transforming both the authorship function and conventional knowledge platforms: A book is not simply ‘finished’ and ‘published,’ but is now part of a much more dynamic, iterative, and dialogical environment that is predicated on versioning, crowd-sourced models of engagement and peer review, and open-source knowledge and publication platforms.” (85) — SIGH.

“emerging fellowships of discourse” (88): great notion, but who has been admitted into the fellowship of this book?

“The authorship function in the Digital Humanities is more collaborative, involving designers, coders, information architects, and server administrators, not to mention scholars from adjacent and nonadjacent disciplinary fields. And the notion of ‘the work’ is significantly more porous and process-oriented, requiring a very different set of criterial to evaluate its merits.” (89)

“a fundamental rethinking of how knowledge gets designed and created, but also a fundamental rethinking of what knowledge looks and sounds like, who gets to create and interact with knowledge, when it is made and recognized, how it gets authored and evaluated, and how it is made accessible to a significantly broader (and potentially global) audience” (90)

“The decolonization of knowledge in the most profound sense will arrive only when we enable people to express their otherness, their difference, and their selves, through truly social and participatory forms of cultural creation.” (91)

“We have yet to fully examine and expose the historical dimensions of classification systems, epistemologies, and knowledge representations in ways that model and present their incommensurabilities across cultures, historical periods, and individual understandings. We must interrogate the spaces for the production of what gets to count as knowledge at a given moment, the modalities for the production and ordering of discourse, and the conditions of possibility for the configuration of knowledge into systems, classification schemata, representations, and ordering principles.” (92)

exclusivity of notions of “public” and “counterpublic”; “Perhaps, then, the utopian impulse of the Digital Humanities can be characterized as a modality of radically opening discourse to participation for everyone… the utopian element of the Digital Humanities is to at least posit, if not fully enable, a future in which participation is possible for everyone, anywhere, anytime. It would be as if it were possible to bring about a public sphere in which no one was excluded.” (94)

changing functions and responsibilities of libraries and university presses

## 4. Provocations

speculative statements about what the Digital Humanities will become

“If the novelty of digital humanities work has already been absorbed into day-to-day business, then what claims can it make for introducing new insights or methods into research for the broader fields of the humanities?” (101)

“When new norms establish themselves, when new procedures and techniques become naturalized, assumptions can become invisible.” (102)

“Maintaining criticality and experimentation means challenging received traditions, even — perhaps, especially — those that defined the first generations of Digital Humanities work.” (103)

“Tools are not just tools. They are cognitive interfaces that presuppose forms of mental and physical discipline and organization.” (105)

“We might come to recognize that what occurs in communities and through communications networks takes a shape that emerges from the patterns of collective activity, rather than merely being the aggregate of individuals’ actions. At this higher level, networked systems of exchange produce a thinking effect, simulacra or real, a sense of knowledge produced at the system level.” (106)

“A tension exists in the contemporary era of the Digital Humanities, with one wing of the humanities embracing quantitative methods, the other continuing to insist upon its roots in qualitative analysis. The quantitative wing becomes integrated into the social sciences. The other fights to defend its autonomy and critical stance. Partnerships and partisanship lie ahead.” (107)

“What is at stake is the humanities’ unique commitment to wrestle with uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity; to model incommensurate temporalities and ontologies; to explore not just geographies but psychogeographies and the dark recesses of the self; to attend to non-repeatable and nonstandard phenomena.” (108)

“An alternate crisis takes place as the Digital Humanities becomes “the humanities” tout court.” (108)

“As concepts of authorship, document, argument, provenance, and reference become increasingly unstable, concepts that are fluid, iterative, and distributive, but less ‘authoritative,’ are taking their place.” (109)

“As every act of engagement with a digital world generates its own trail of data and metadata, the crucial tasks of forgetting, of strategically looking away, of ignoring, of letting go and even of erasure will become more critical.” (111)

“Advanced work in the Digital Humanities will either target pre-contemporary cultural corpora or live dangerously with respect to the law.” (112)

“Work in the humanities will rely on new modes of assessment, altered models of training, and shifts in our understanding of how we value professional, citizen, and amateur contributions to knowledge.” (113)

“Total conservation and preservation is not an option, but it never really was.” (115)

“The recognition that the task of cultural memory is not exhaustive, but selective, that the shape of who we are is determined as much by what does not remain as what does, is a founding principle of humanistic scholarship and one that underscores the situated character of all knowledge.” (115)

“The Digital Humanities reframes our notion of the scholar from the tenured sage in a warren-like office to include a wider range of participants — staff members with research training, community archivists, curators of objects, designers who make it part of their practice to work on humanistic projects, programmers who specialize in cross-disciplinary tool building. This expansion of whom we think of as performing scholarship coincides, sometimes all too complicitly, with the de-tenuring of faculty and the inclusion of adjunct and precarious workers into every facet of academia.” (117)

“Without making, theory has no traction. Without theory, practice has no critical purchase.” (119)

“If the humanities are to thrive and not just exist in niches of privilege, they will have to visibly demonstrate the contributions to knowledge and society they are making in the digital era. This means shaping — not parroting or simply using — the language of our era.” (120)
