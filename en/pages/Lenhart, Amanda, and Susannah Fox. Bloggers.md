Lenhart, Amanda, and Susannah Fox. “Bloggers: A Portrait of the Internet's New Storytellers.” 19 July 2006. Pew Internet and American Life Project. <http://www.pewinternet.org/2006/07/19/bloggers/>.


"blogging is inspiring a new group of writers and creators to share their voices with the world. Some 54% of bloggers say that they have never published their writing or media creations anywhere else; 44% say they have published elsewhere" (Lenhart & Fox i)

"Eight percent of internet users, or about 12 million American adults, keep a blog. Thirty-nine percent of internet users, or about 57 million American adults, read blogs – a significant increase since the fall of 2005" (Lenhart & Fox i)

"While many well-publicized blogs focus on politics, the most popular topic among bloggers is their life and experiences" (Lenhart & Fox ii)

"Most bloggers say they cover a lot of different topics, but when asked to choose one main topic, 37% of bloggers cite “my life and experiences” as a primary topic of their blog. Politics and government ran a very distant second with 11% of bloggers citing those issues of public life as the main subject of their blog" (Lenhart & Fox ii)

"More than half (54%) of bloggers are under the age of 30. Like the internet population in general, however, bloggers are evenly divided between men and women, and more than half live in the suburbs. Another third live in urban areas and a scant 13% live in rural regions" (Lenhart & Fox ii)

"bloggers are less likely to be white than the general internet population. Sixty percent of bloggers are white, 11% are African American, 19% are English-speaking Hispanic and 10% identify as some other race.  By contrast, 74% of internet users are white, 9% are African American, 11% are English-speaking Hispanic and 6% identify as some other race" (Lenhart & Fox ii)

"55% of bloggers blog under a pseudonym, and 46% blog under their own name" (Lenhart & Fox ii)

"The main reasons for keeping a blog are creative expression and sharing personal experiences" (Lenhart & Fox iii)

"95% of bloggers get news from the internet, compared with 73% of all internet users" (Lenhart & Fox iv)

"77% of bloggers have shared their own artwork, photos, stories, or videos online, compared with 26% of all internet users" (Lenhart & Fox iv)

"87% of bloggers allow comments on their blog.
 41% of bloggers say they have a blogroll or friends list on their blog.
 Only 18% of bloggers offer an RSS feed of their blog’s content" (Lenhart & Fox iv)

"Some observers have suggested that blogging is nothing more than the next step in a burgeoning culture of narcissism and exhibitionism spurred by reality TV and other elements of the modern media environment. But others contend that blogging promises a democratization of voices that can now bypass the institutional gatekeepers of mainstream media" (Lenhart & Fox 1)

"When asked 'What does your blog mean to you?' the largest group of bloggers (44%) replied that their blog is 'something I do, but not something I spend a lot of time on,' a point that meshes with the findings that bloggers do not update their blogs very frequently and do not spend much time updating their blogs in any given week. Only 13% of bloggers post new material every day. The typical blogger spends five hours per week updating his or her main blog. Another sizable contingent of bloggers (40%) describes blogging as a hobby that they enjoy working on when they can. There is a smaller core of devoted users, just 13%, who say that their blog is very important to them, and describe it as a big part of their life" (Lenhart & Fox 7)

"Sixty-two percent of bloggers did not have a personal website before launching their blog and 54% of bloggers had not published their writing or media creations anywhere else, either online or offline. 
Three in four bloggers (77%) told us that expressing themselves creatively was a reason that they blog. Younger and lower-income bloggers were more likely than other groups to give this as a reason to blog. Similarly, most bloggers (76%) say that they blog to document their personal experiences and share them with others. Younger users were among the most likely to say that they blog to document and share their lives" (Lenhart & Fox 7)

"Nearly two-thirds of bloggers (64%) say they blog on a lot of different topics" (Lenhart & Fox 9)

"While blogs can address any conceivable subject, we asked bloggers to classify the main topic of their blog. The largest percentage of bloggers in our sample (37%) say that 'my life and personal experiences' was the main topic. Women who blog and younger bloggers were more likely than other groups to say that they blogged mainly about personal experiences" (Lenhart & Fox 9)

"Bloggers are inspired, for the most part, by things that happen to them, or something they read or observe. More than three-quarters of bloggers (78%) say that a personal experience has inspired them to post.  Only 12% say they have never posted about a personal experience" (Lenhart & Fox 9)

"There is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship between bloggers and blogs. A little more than half of all bloggers (53%) have just one blog, but another 17% have two blogs, and 26% author three or more. Of bloggers who report having more than one blog, more than half (61%) say that they have three or more blogs. Not surprisingly, bloggers with more blogs report spending more hours per week on average tending their blogs than do single-author bloggers. It is also not clear whether all of the blogs of multi-bloggers are currently active" (Lenhart & Fox 10)

"Nearly three in ten bloggers say that their primary blog is a multi-author blog. Seven in ten say that they are the only author of their main blog" (Lenhart & Fox 10)

"Blog content that is appropriate or even funny for a friend can also be cause for dismissal to a supervisor or employer. To avoid the problem of colliding life spheres and to protect personal privacy, many bloggers use a pseudonym to keep their offline life separate from their online thoughts. In fact, a bit more than half of bloggers (55%) surveyed say they blog under a pseudonym or made-up name, while 43% say they blog using their real name" (Lenhart & Fox 10)

"One-quarter of bloggers post one to two days a week, and about one in seven bloggers (15%) post three to five days a week. Twenty-eight percent of bloggers say they post new material to their blog every few weeks. About one in five bloggers (19%) post every few weeks or less often" (Lenhart & Fox 12)

"Fully 70% of bloggers only post when inspiration strikes, while 22% of bloggers usually update on a regular schedule. A lucky 4% of bloggers say that both options are true: Inspiration strikes on schedule" (Lenhart & Fox 12)

"Eight out of ten (83%) of bloggers say that they usually blog from home, while 7% say they usually blog at work, and another 6% blog equally at home and at work" (Lenhart & Fox 13)

"LiveJournal users are more likely to be female (22% of all female bloggers in our sample used LiveJournal compared with only 7% of the males) and young – nearly one in five of our 18-29 year old bloggers used LiveJournal.  Blogger had more than its share of college graduates with 13% of college-educated bloggers using Blogger and 12% using LiveJournal as compared with 4% of bloggers with college degrees who use MySpace and 2% who use Xanga.  MySpace has a larger share of bloggers who have not yet continued their education past high school" (Lenhart & Fox 14)

"Despite its relatively minor importance in the lives of most bloggers, blogging is still an important enough part of their lives that eight out of ten (82%) of bloggers think they will still be blogging a year from now.  One in ten bloggers (11%) say they will not, 3% say they have already stopped, and 4% say they are not sure if they will still be blogging in a year" (Lenhart & Fox 16)

"Despite a blogger’s often private sense of the nature of his or her blog, the act of keeping a blog (unless password protected or otherwise locked down) is an inherently public act. Blogs are generally kept so that they may be read by others, yet the audience of a particular blog is technically nearly impossible to measure. While Web servers have traditionally collected information about who or what visits them, in this day and age of RSS feeds, many blog readers who might have been counted by server or site traffic logs are now obscured behind the single visit of an RSS feed reader’s URL or IP address" (Lenhart & Fox 17)

"nearly half of the bloggers in our sample (47%) say they do not know their traffic statistics. One in five bloggers (22%) say they have fewer than ten hits a day in blog traffic, and 17% say they have 10 to 99 hits on a typical day. Just 13% have more than 100 hits a day, though a handful in this group has much larger traffic levels" (Lenhart & Fox 18)

"Many bloggers who say they blog 'for themselves' truly do—these bloggers report lower numbers of daily hits than other bloggers" (Lenhart & Fox 18)

"In many ways it is not surprising that so few blogs have achieved major recognition politically or in the media. As Clay Shirky points out in his essay, 'Power Laws, Weblogs and Inequality,' traffic to blogs builds unevenly, and those who garnered traffic early in the history of blogging for whatever reason will tend to continue to gain traffic over time, while newer blogs will have a harder time earning the same amount of traffic" (Lenhart & Fox 19)

"Blog writers are enthusiastic blog readers. 
Fully 90% of bloggers say they have read someone else’s blog, compared with 39% of all internet users who say they have done so" (Lenhart & Fox 19)

"Fully 87% of bloggers in our sample allow comments on their blogs; only 13% do not allow them" (Lenhart & Fox 20)

"While male bloggers are more likely than female bloggers to not only check in on other blogs, but to do so several times a day, male bloggers are not significantly more likely than female bloggers to post comments" (Lenhart & Fox 20)

"Number of American adults who use the internet: 147 million
Number of American adults who read blogs: 57 million
Number of American adults who keep a blog: 12 million" (Lenhart & Fox 22)
