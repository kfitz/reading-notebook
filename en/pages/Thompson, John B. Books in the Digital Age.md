Thompson, John B. Books in the Digital Age: The Transformation of Academic and Higher Education Publishing in Britain and the United States.  Cambridge, UK:  Polity Press, 2005.


Introduction

"Many have wondered whether the printed book will go the way of the vinyl LP and become a collector's item, a curious relic of a bygone age, while the content that was once packaged and distributed in books will be disseminated in other ways." (Thompson 1)

"as the new millennium dawned, it soon became clear that much of the speculation about the future of the book had been misguided.  By the end of 2001 the much heralded ebook revolution had faltered -- it was beginning to look like one of those technological revolutions that had failed, but in any case it had most definitely been postponed -- and the dot.com bubble that had pumped milions of dollars into online experiments of various kinds had burst." (Thompson 1-2)

"So what are the key changes that are transforming the book publishing industry today?  Technology undoubtedly has an important role to play, but it is only part of the story.  The industry is also undergoing major changes of a social and economic kind" (Thompson 2)

"Most editors -- and certainly most successful editors today -- are more proactive than the notion of the gatekeeper would suggest." (Thompson 4)

"The story of the impact of digitization in the world of publishing is, in part, the story of how publishers have come to realize that the content they acquire is an asset that can be manipulated and stored in digital form, and how they have experimented -- sometimes successfully, sometimes disastrously -- with the realization and dissemination of this content in formats other than the bound and printed book." (Thompson 10)

"It is rare for the fields of academic and college textbook publishing to be noticed, let alone analysed in depth, in the more popular commentaries on the publishing industry." (Thompson 10)

"irrespective of the fate of these various experiments, the impact of digitization in the world of publishing has already been profound and irreversible, for it has set in motion another revolution -- a quiet revolution, hidden from the gaze of most journalistic commentators -- which is transforming and will continue to transform the very nature of publishing as a business and what we could call the life cycle of the book." (Thompson 12)


1.  Publishing as an economic and cultural practice

gradual separation of roles of printer and publisher

"most books don't do very well, and very few books do very well.  For most publishers, around 20 percent of titles will account for around 80 percent of revenue." (Thompson 17)

the publishing cycle; the publishing chain

"Among commercial academic publishers, it is not uncommon for overall profit margins to be in the region of 5-10 per cent.  Many of the American university presses operate on a break-even basis and, in some cases, depend on grants and subsidies of various kinds from their host institutions in order to balance their accounts." (Thompson 26)


2.  The social structure of publishing fields

"Academic publishing is closely bound up with the world of scholarly and scientific research.  It publishes books which are written by scholars and researchers and which are intended primarily for other scholars and researchers, although in some cases they may also be bought and/or read by students and other readers." (Thompson 38)

"In addition to providing authors and creating markets for books, the academic field also supplies publishers with multiple forms of editorial advice and input on actual or potential projects, from reading and commenting on proposals and draft manuscripts to editing series of books on specific themes or topics." (Thompson 45)

"Academics also depend on publishers to take on and support the publication of their work, even though the costs of doing so may exceed the benefits gained in purely financial terms." (Thompson 45)

"But even if commercial considerations are not uppermost in the minds of academic editors at university presses, they are not altogether absent; and as the economic conditions of scholarly publishing have become more difficult, these considerations, which had previously remained in the background of decision-making processes, have come increasingly to the fore" (Thompson 46)


3.  The publishing field since 1980

five broad developments:  "the growth of title output; concentration and corporate power; the transformation of the retail sector; the globalization of markets and publishing firms; and the impact of new technologies" (Thompson 47)

"In effect, the process of consolidation in the book publishing industry has contributed to the increasing differentiation of the world of publishing into relatively distinct fields, with trade publishing becoming increasingly dominated by a small set of media conglomerates which have substantial stakes in the world of entertainment, with educational publishing becoming increasingly dominated by a small set of international corporations which are more geared toward the world of education, and so on." (Thompson 61)

"There are some publishing fields where the process of consolidation has proceeded more slowly and less decisively, although these fields have experienced the consequences of consolidation in other, more indirect ways.  The field of academic (or scholarly) publishing is a good example.  This is partly because academic publishing is less profitable than other types of publishing, and is therefore of little interest to the large commercial firms, and partly because a substantial part of academic publishing has been carried out by the university presses, whose position as not-for-profit organizations linked to universities has protected them to a large extent from the logic of mergers and acquisitions." (Thompson 61)

"The rise of powerful corporate players in the fields of STM publishing and journal publishing has squeezed the budgets of university libraries with dire consequences for academic publishers" (Thompson 61-63)

rise of retail superstores:  "Smaller publishers, including the university presses, benefited from this dramatic increase in retail shelf space.  For many publishers (including the university presses) sales soared in the 1990s" (Thompson 70)


4.  Academic publishing under pressure

"Academic publishing is an integral part of a broader research process" (Thompson 81)

"the production of research outputs fulfils two distinct but equally important functions -- *dissemination* and *certification*" (Thompson 82)

"To some extent, the legitimacy bestowed by the publishing organization is a reflection of the mechanisms of selection and approval used by it, and especially the mechanism of peer review" (Thompson 83)

"the kind of recognition they gain for their work, both in terms of the legitimacy bestowed by the journal or publisher and in terms of other forms of peer recognition such as reviews and prizes, is for many scholars and researchers the most important benefit of publication, far outweighing any direct financial return." (Thompson 83)

"The so-called 'crisis of the monograph' is rooted in a disjunction -- which is growing more and more pronounced -- between the output sanctions of the disciplines and the market demand for scholarly monographs." (Thompson 84)

"As part of their constitutional remit, university presses are committed to publishing scholarly works.  For the most part these presses are registered as charities or not-for-profits, and hence are not liable (in all or nearly all of their territories of operation) to pay corporation tax.  In some cases these presses are constituted as departments within their host universities; in other cases they are established as administrative units within the universities and report to a particular officer" (Thompson 87)

"Many of the American university presses have traditionally received financial assistance from their host institutions in various forms, ranging from annual operating grants to cover deficits to rent-free accommodation, free employee benefits and interest-free overdraft facilities.... However, not all American university presses receive direct financial assistance from their host institutions.  Some are expected to break even, and in recent decades many of the university presses have experienced growing pressure to reduce their dependence on their host institutions" (Thompson 88-89)

"Some commercial publishers active in the field of academic publishing are parts of large conglomerates which have gross turnovers of several billion dollars, but gross figures of this kind tell one very little about the economic power of these organizations in the field of academic publishing" (Thompson 92)

"one key development in the field of academic publishing over the last few decades that stands out above all others:  the decline of the scholarly monograph" (Thompson 93)

"In the 1970s academic publishers would commonly print between 2,000 and 3,000 hardback copies of a scholarly monograph." (Thompson 93)

"Today many academic publishers say that total sales of hardback-only monographs are often as low as 400-500 copies worldwide." (Thompson 94)

"The unit sales of scholarly monographs have fallen to a quarter or less of what they were in the 1970s" (Thompson 94)

"given the differentiated pattern of monograph sales, some disciplines or subdisciplines were becoming less and less attractive to publishers as areas for scholarly monograph publishing." (Thompson 97)

"in the case of university presses, they may feel some pressure to continue publishing in those disciplines which have a strong and vocal constituency within their own universities" (Thompson 98)

"For many commercial academic publishers, the way out of this dilemma was not too difficult to see: at the end of the day, commercial logic would tend to override any obligation they might feel to the scholarly community." (Thompson 98)

"During the economic recession of the 1980s, many universities dependent on public funding found that their budgets were being squeezed, and university administrators looked for ways to cut costs.  Library budgets -- and especially budgets for new acquisitions -- were vulnerable." (Thompson 98)

"Since the early 1980s, two additional factors have played an increasingly important role in squeezing the budgets for new book acquisitions by university libraries: the growing proportion of acquisitions budgets which is spent on periodicals, and the growing expenditure by libraries on IT services and on the acquisition of content in electronic formats." (Thompson 99)

"In 1997 journals were thirty times more expensive than they were in 1970" (Thompson 99)

"The pressure on librarians' budgets has also bee exacerbated by consolidation in the field of journal publishing.... Publishers who control a large number of key journals are in a strong position to bundle their journals and to negotiate prices for electronic site licenses." (Thompson 100)

development of alternative forums:  arXiv, PLoS, SPARC

"The erosion of library budgets for new book acquisitions has undoubtedly had a significant impact on the sales of scholarly books, since university libraries are a principal market for books of this kind." (Thompson 107)

"For the most part, the American university presses were set up with the aim of advancing and disseminating knowledge by publishing high-quality scholarly work; they were generally seen as an integral part of the function of the university." (Thompson 108)

"In the 1970s and 1980s, this situation began to change, and some university presses found themselves faced with growing pressure from their host institutions to reduce their financial dependency.... As many universities found their budgets being squeezed, they began to scrutinize their activities with a renewed sense of purpose, and the subsidies provided to university presses were viewed by some in university administrations as inessential expenditures." (Thompson 108)

"the university presses have been subjected to more intensive financial scrutiny than was commonly the case in the past." (Thompson 109)

"The new climate of financial accountability has not only subjected the university presses to more intensive forms of scrutiny: it has also highlighted a deep uncertainty within universities about the nature and purpose of a university press.  On the one hand, many universities want to have a press which publishes scholarly work of the highest quality, and thus both reflects and contributes to the standing of the university as a centre of research and excellence... But given the deterioration in the market for scholarly books, the expectation that university presses should contribute to the symbolic capital of the university while making little or no demand on its economic capital was unrealistic." (Thompson 109)


5.  Academic publishing in transition (1):  changing organizational structures

how publishers have responded to financial pressures; not all in the same way

"The picture is complicated still further when one takes account of the changing practices of commercial academic publishers, who, being generally less constrained by constitutional obligations but more exposed to market realities, have often followed other paths (or have followed similar paths but in more radical ways)." (Thompson 111)

primary changes: reduce costs and increase prices; cost reductions come in "(1) reducing typesetting costs, (2) lowering royalties, (3) streamlining production processes, and (4) bringing down overheads by outsourcing and other methods." (Thompson 112)

reduction in typesetting costs from £14/page in 1978 to £2.80/page in 2003

"the average monograph unit price in the US rose by 50 per cent between 1986 and 1992" (Thompson 116), though US university presses have been more cautious about raising prices

move from hardback-only publication to simultaneous hardback/paperback publication

publishers "discovered that when they published new books in both cloth and paper, the sales of the cloth edition commonly fell to even lower levels -- by 2000, some academic publishers had found that the sales of the cloth edition had fallen to as low as 200 copies worldwide.  The falling hardback sales meant that the financial viability of a new book published in dual editions depended increasingly on the sales of the paper edition, but in many cases the paper sales were simply too modest to make up the lost ground." (Thompson 123)

"Greater selectivity in terms of title acquisition may be an entirely sensible strategy, but there are two problems with this kind of response.  The first is that it assumes a correlation between the quality of a monograph and its likely sales which may not be fully justified.... The second problem with the strategy of increased selectivity is that it is often difficult to implement in practice.  Partly this is because judgements of quality are by nature controversial and there is often room for disagreement, especially in the humanities and social sciences." (Thompson 126-27)

"a structured shift of emphasis:  staff are urged to spend less time and fewer resources on the acquisition, development and marketing of monographs and to devote more attention to acquiring, developing and marketing other kinds of books" (Thompson 128)

"an organization that tries to publish across too many subject areas runs the risk of spreading itself too thinly.  It may end up building a list that has a presence in many subject areas but excels in none" (Thompson 129)

"MIT Press was an early mover in the shift towards greater disciplinary specialization among the university presses and today it is regarded by some as a model to be emulated." (Thompson 130)

"as the library marked eroded and the sales of scholarly monographs declined, editors were encouraged (and, in many cases, required) to think more carefully about the sales potential of the new projects they were proposing and the input of sales and marketing staff began to assume a more significant role." (Thompson 134)

"Question of quality have certainly not been brushed aside -- the suggestion that quality has been sacrificed on the altar of the market would be an oversimplification of the dynamic of this field.  But questions of quality have been supplemented in myriad ways by considerations of the sales potential and financial viability of new book projects." (Thompson 137)

"the fundamental question is this:  how can an organization continue to operate as an academic publisher when the market for its principal output -- the scholarly monograph -- is in serious and seemingly continuous decline?" (Thompson 139)


6.  Academic publishing in transition (2): list diversification and field migration

"list diversification can give rise to new kinds of vulnerability.  By moving into new fields, academic publishers may be able to create growth while the markets are strong and expanding, but when those markets contract the publishers may find themselves exposed in a particularly dangerous way, with one foot in a declining market for scholarly monographs and another foot in a market to which they had turned for growth but which is now contracting... This is exactly what happened to many academic publishers -- and especially the American university presses -- in 2001 and 2002" (Thompson 144-45)

"While there were many factors that made the textbook market attractive to academic publishers in the 1980s and 1990s, in practice UK-based academic publishers were more inclined to move into this field than the American university presses." (Thompson 147)

"Harvard's success in ploughing the ground between academic and trade publishing provided a model which other university presses have sought to emulate with varying degrees of dedication and success." (Thompson 149)

but logic of trade publishing radically different from scholarly publishing, with different kinds of risks

"If sales of scholarly monographs were falling to unsustainable levels, commercial publishers could wind down their scholarly publishing programs and could even, in the most extreme cases, exit the field." (Thompson 159)

"there are many disciplines in the humanities and social sciences where the book continues to play an important role as a means of making available the results of research and as a medium for the development of extended analyses and arguments -- not all scholarly work in the humanities and social sciences can be accommodated in the framework of the twenty-page journal article." (Thompson 162)

"The relations between academic publishers, on the one hand, and academics in the academic field, on the other, become increasingly strained, as the trajectories of field migration propel publishers in directions that do not coincide with, and in some respects directly conflict with, the aims and priorities of academics." (Thompson 166)

"the constraints and conditions of success in the academic field place ever greater pressure on academics and prospective academics to publish scholarly work based on original research and to avoid investing time and energy in writing material which is introductory and pedagogical in character." (Thompson 166)


7.  Academic publishing at the crossroads

"for the university presses, exiting the field was never an option.  They felt obliged to continue publishing scholarly work, both because this was a central part of their educational mission and because they were locked into a system of certification in the academic world from which they could not easily extricate themselves.  The university presses found themselves in the increasingly uncomfortable position of having to continue with a form of publishing where revenues and margins were declining while at the same time trying to ensure that their overall financial position was secure." (Thompson 167)

"Economic considerations began to weigh more heavily in their editorial deliberations -- not because economic considerations didn't matter in the past (they did), but because the relatively buoyant institutional market of earlier decades, which had supported the scholarly monograph business and afforded academic publishers the luxury of being able to take sales for granted while focusing their attention on questions of quality and intellectual worth, had fallen away from under their feet." (Thompson 168)

"in the course of the 1980s and 1990s, university administrators at some host institutions expected the university presses to reduce their dependence on direct or indirect subsidies and to become more autonomous financially -- 'self-supporting' was the term often used." (Thompson 169)

"What are these presses?  Are they academic units or are they so-called enterprise or business units?" (Thompson 169, quoting a press director)

"2001-2 was a rude awakening for many of the American university presses.  Many had become accustomed to steady growth during the long decade of the late 1980s and 1990s, but in 2001-2 they experienced a sudden chance of fortunes that caught many by surprise." (Thompson 172) -- reports as related to sudden heavy returns from major chain booksellers; diversification increased exposure

"the expansion in supply of scholarly content, driven by the logic of the academic field and linked to the hopes and expectations of individual academics and prospective academics whose careers depend on their ability to publish, has occurred at the same time as the market for scholarly books has collapsed." (Thompson 175)

"In the American context, this clash of logics is expressed with growing disquiet in the controversies over the role of the university presses in the tenure system." (Thompson 175)

"The pressure to publish for the purposes of securing tenure encourages young academics to publish quickly, and to publish books that will be recognized by other academics as worthy or even significant contributions to the field.... But academic publishers (including the university presses) are less and less interested in publishing books which are high-level contributions to a specialized field of scholarship; they are looking, instead, for books which have a broader appeal, which tackle broader topics and spill over disciplinary boundaries, perhaps even spill over into a general trade market." (Thompson 176-77)

"At the very least, tenure committees in the humanities and social sciences should reflect on the changing conditions of academic publishing and take account of the fact that the publication decisions of university presses are shaped by a range of considerations which have very little to do with the sheer quality of a scholar's work." (Thompson 179)

"But ingrained practices are hard to change, and in a context of fewer tenure-track jobs and increasing competition for those that do exist, it may be difficult to break the cycle of credential inflation that has placed growing pressure on the university presses." (Thompson 180)

"one should not underestimate the difficulty of bringing about any significant change in the tenure system and the support provided for scholarly publishing, especially when the competition for tenure is likely to become more intense and when the resources available to both libraries and presses are likely to come under increasing pressure." (Thompson 180)

ties of all this to end of Golden Age in American higher education

how to fix?  "without wishing to suggest that these points are particularly novel, I would highlight the following four measures:  (1) further changes in publishing strategies; (2) greater selectivity in list-building; (3) more emphasis on textbook publishing; and (4) more effort devoted to public relations." (Thompson 183)

"Judged in relation to the revenue generated in current market conditions, the American university presses are overproducing and underpricing their scholarly monographs.  They are able to do this provided that their host institutions are willing to subsidize the press and/or provided that they are able to generate surpluses in their other publishing activities, which they can use to create an internal subsidy for their monograph programme." (Thompson 184) -- this only obtains, however, if we want to think about scholarly publishing as a revenue center within the university, as an enterprise that can and should be producing products for sale in the marketplace

"External subsidies from host institutions will have to be replaced by (or, in cases where they remain, augmented by) internal subsidies which can be created by moving into more profitable forms of publishing." (Thompson 185)

"The academic world has come to depend on the field of academic publishing (together with that of scholarly journals) as a principal means for the dissemination of scholarly work and as a key mechanism of professional certification, and yet, ironically, most academics are woefully ignorant of what is happening in this field upon which so much of their own success now depends." (Thompson 189)

"in many of the humanities and social sciences, books continue to play a vital role in the ways that scholars communicate their work and their ideas.  Books are often the focus of discussion, controversy and debate; they are key reference points for both teaching and research and a crucial means by which these disciplines evolve." (Thompson 189)

"Will these problems be solved by technology?  Will the coming of electronic systems of content delivery do away with the need to publish scholarly monographs in the traditional printed format, replacing them with electronic texts that can be accessed anywhere and anytime?" (Thompson 190)

"While many of the experiments are still underway, we now know enough to draw one reasonably firm conclusion: just as the digital revolution was not the origin of the problems faced by academic publishers today, so too it is unlikely to be their salvation." (Thompson 190)

"It is encouraging that there are some within the academic community who have begun to ask whether their institutions can and should continue to rely on the output of scholarly publishers to provide the credentials upon which their systems of tenure and promotion are based -- many scholarly publishers would be only too pleased to be relieved of what they have come to see as an unwanted burden." (Thompson 190)

"the principal rationale for continuing to publish scholarly monographs despite the long-term decline in sales has to do, not with the needs of tenure committees, but rather with the intellectual life of the disciplines: scholarly monographs merit publication in so far as they make important contributions to knowledge which are vital for the development of disciplines and valued by the academic community." (Thompson 190)

"The scholarly monograph can survive only if there is a recognition on the part of the academic community that it remains a valuable medium for the dissemination of research and scholarship which deserves the active support of the academic community itself -- through, among other things, the vigorous defence of the book acquisitions budgets of university libraries, the provision of subsidies for specific publication projects and, above all, the willingness of host institutions to support their university presses in difficult times." (Thompson 191)

12.  The digital revolution and the publishing world

"for years it has been a running joke in the industry that the only way to make money out of electronic publishing is to organize a conference on it" (Thompson 309)

"The inflated expectations of the mid-1990s are now in the past and we can reflect with a more sober sense of reality on what kinds of changes are likely to occur (and which are likely to endure) in this domain." (Thompson 309)

"Today there are few who believe that electronic delivery is going to provide a quick fix to the financial woes of book publishers -- if anything, the costs associated with building systems and managing content in digital formats are much higher than many people assumed in the 1990s, and in most cases the revenues have come nowhere near to covering the costs." (Thompson 311)

different levels of impact of digitization of publishing: operating systems, content management and manipulation, marketing and service provision, content delivery

focuses on relationship of new technologies to markets -- what's the added value?

"six respects in which new technologies can enable content providers to add real value to content:  (1) *ease of access*, (2) *updatability*, (3) *scale*, (4) *searchability*, (5) *intertextuality*, and (6) *multimedia*." (Thompson 318)

"some forms of content lend themselves more readily to delivery in an online environment than others" (Thompson 320)

forms of content:  data, information, knowledge, narrative; success of journals for the publication of "discrete results" online

"the obstacles to moving extended texts into an online environment are not just technological: they are also social and cultural." (Thompson 326)

"books are embedded in social contexts of varying kinds and the use of books is bound up with institutions and clusters of social practices." (Thompson 326)

"Books are not merely objects which will be swiftly and automatically replaced by technologically more efficient modes of content delivery, for they are bound up with forms of life and social practices which change only slowly and gradually." (Thompson 326)

"It is one of the many ironies of this unfolding story that the field of publishing which -- if my analysis is correct -- is least amenable to online dissemination has been the very field where the experiments in ebooks have received the most attention in the press." (Thompson 329)


13.  Academic publishing and the digital revolution

"The terrain of the late 1990s is littered with the remnants of experiments in electronic publishing that have either failed outright or have limped along from one year to the next, gradually metamorphosing from one model into another in search of the ever elusive revenue stream." (Thompson 330)

"the amount of savings that publishers were able to make by publishing in an electronic medium were often overestimated by the early proponents, both because the cost of printing, paper and binding was only a relatively small part of the overall cost involved in publishing a book and because it's not cheap to convert or mark up texts and to put in place the kind of hardware and software needed to publish electronically (together with suitably qualified technical staff." (Thompson 332)

Robert Darnton's "pyramid model" of electronic scholarship -- see http://www.theaha.org/prizes/gutenberg/rdarnton.cfm; see also "The New Age of the Book," NYRB 18 Mar 1999

"the key question in the end is whether the publication and dissemination of scholarly content in this way can be transformed into an economically viable proposition for publishers and/or other organizations.  For however compelling the idea may be from a purely scholarly point of view, the ability to turn this idea into a sustainable form of publication presupposes that sufficient resources are available to cover the costs of doing so." (Thompson 333)

different potential models for electronic scholarly publishing:  virtual library model (netLibrary, Questia, ebrary); digital warehouse model (Versaware); scholarly corpus model (CIAO, Gutenberg-e project, History Ebook Project, TORCH, Oxford Scholarship Online), scholarly community model (CogNet)

"The market for virtual library collections is overwhelmingly an institutional market." (Thompson 346)

"*the principal market for scholarly book content in electronic form is likely to be institutional rather than individual*" (Thompson 368)

"The best way to maximize the added value of delivering scholarly book content online is *to treat individual books as part of a scholarly corpus or database which has scale, selectivity and focus*." (Thompson 369)

"Another key issue that has shaped the debate so far is what we could describe as the legacy of print.  There is a tension here between two different ways of thinking about the nature of scholarly monographs delivered in an online environment.  One approach is to think of scholarly monographs delivered online as effectively the same as print monographs.... Another approach is to think of the electronic medium as offering radically new opportunities for the way in which scholarly work is carried out, published, disseminated, and read." (Thompson 372)

"What all publishers should be doing at the very least, however, is two things.  First, they should be thinking hard about what they are publishing and why.... Second, they should also be developing systems and workflows which enable them to prepare, gather together and store their content in suitable digital formats." (Thompson 375)
