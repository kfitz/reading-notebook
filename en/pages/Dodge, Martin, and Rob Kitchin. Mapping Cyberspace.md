Dodge, Martin, and Rob Kitchin.  Mapping Cyberspace.  New York:  Routledge, 2001

Preface

argues for the importance of space and the ways new ICTs (information and communication technologies) are “reconfiguring space-time relations, radically restructuring the materiality and spatiality of space and the relationship between people and place” (Dodge and Kitchin ix)

also suggests that we are encountering “new media that are increasingly reliant on spatial metaphors to enhance their operations” (Dodge and Kitchin ix) — as if technologies can rely on metaphors, rather than humans relying on metaphors to describe technologies?  [At a minimum, this begs the question of whether the technologies rely on the metaphor or whether we do, whether we choose our metaphors or whether our use of them is determined by the technologies themselves.]

on the other hand, the major impetus for this volume is, as they argue, “that geography continues to matter, despite recent rhetoric claiming the ‘death of distance’” (Dodge and Kitchin x)  Though they may attribute spatiality to electronic communications, they nonetheless seem to insist on the continuing demands of lived space.

1.  Introducing cyberspace

“The term cyberspace literally means ‘navigable space’” (Dodge and Kitchin 1)

in this volume, “cyberspace refers to the conceptual space within ICTs… rather than the technology itself” (Dodge and Kitchin 1)

multiplicity of cyberspaces — brief outline  (internet/intranet; virtual reality)

of VR:  aim is “to create a sophisticated conceptual space where the experiences are the same as the real world; to make ‘cyberspace into a place’” (Dodge and Kitchin 5) — suggestion that VR will lead to a Gibsonian 3-D cyberspace

signaled attempt to move away from technological determinism:  new technologies “are portrayed as being revolutionary in nature when in reality the developments are the evolutionary outcome of many other initiatives” (Dodge and Kitchin 6) — cites Marvin

“the Internet was the outcome of a specific set of political-economic relations (for example, the Cold War):  the Internet has a particular historical geography that centres it in the US, and early Internet development was guided by the military-industrial complex” (Dodge and Kitchin 7)

why ICTs/cyberspace matter:  “they disrupt a number of processes and foundational assumptions that form the basis of modernist society and epistemologies” (Dodge and Kitchin 13) — [ties into my sense that the changes we attribute to postmodernism are deeply imbricated with those we attribute to new media]

space/spacelessness:  “Those who declare the ‘death of distance’ (e.g., Cairncross 1997) maintain that the instantaneous communications of the Internet and Intranets have led to a collapse in spatial and temporal boundaries, leading to radical space-time compression which frees social and capital relations from modernist spatial logic” (Dodge and Kitchin 13)

“modern ICTs complement the negation of spatial separation with additional services that are more ubiquitous, allowing wider and more ready exploitation.  Here, the increasing efficiency of communication is translating into greater and more efficient productivity by permitting the exploitation of a truly globalised economy” (Dodge and Kitchin 13)

Benedikt, Intro to Cyberspace:  First Steps — questions “the significance of geographical location” (qtd on Dodge and Kitchin 14)

Gillespie & Williams — telecom not just “distance shrinking” but rendering distance meaningless

“Time, it is argued, is becoming the crucial dimension of who is accessible, rather than geographic location....  It is thus argued that the transformative agency of ICTs makes geographic space essential ‘spaceless’ in that the contingency of space as a determinate of material practices is destroyed; geography no longer matters” (Dodge and Kitchin 14) — volume intends to counter this point:  “Geography continues to matter — as an organising principle and as a constituent of social relations; it cannot be entirely eliminated” (Dodge and Kitchin 14)

“the main spatial processes of modernism, such as centralisation, continue to operate because the use of ICTs as globalising agents are still dependent on real-world spatial fixity — the points of access, the physicality and materiality of the wires” (Dodge and Kitchin 15) — moreover, globalization never eliminates the local

Castells:  “division of spatial logic” into “space of flows” and “space of places”

gestures toward Jameson and Harvey

place/placelessness:  “a combination of cultural globalisation and the spatiality of cyberspace itself is thought to be transforming ‘real’ world spatiality and the relationship between people and place” (Dodge and Kitchin 15)

Relph, Place and Placelessness (1976)

are ICTs creating breakdown in relationship to place, or antidote to breakdown?

industrial/postindustrial:  Poster’s “mode of information”

“Some analysts (e.g., Harvey 1989) believe that all other aspects of late-modern societies, such as cultural transformations, are residue effects as the socio-spatial logic of modern economies is restructured into a new social-spatial nexus; as capitalist systems of production mutate to take advantage of globalising technologies and flexible modes of accumulation in an attempt to find a new ‘spatial fix’” (Dodge and Kitchin 18)

public/private:  “Paradoxically, it is argued that cyberspace is creating new public spaces while being one of the principal means through which public space in the geographic domain is monitored” (Dodge and Kitchin 19)

broadcasters/listeners:  cyberspace disrupts traditional power structures of communication; adds new forms of communication; alters nature of interaction

real/virtual:  cyberspace heightens the blurring of reality and representation; simulation, hyperreality, simulacra

overcoming of real geography by cyberspace:  “city structure is becoming composed of and controlled by computers, and a recursive relationship is evolving so that as the city becomes composed of computers, the computer network (the collective power and information of computers across a city) is the city” (Dodge and Kitchin 22)

nature/technology:  cyborg

fixed/fluid:  modernist v. postmodern identity; cyberspace as disembodied and anonymous; gender/role play

“Although identity is undoubtedly non-essentialist and fluid, and cyberspace provides a media [sic] to explore identity, cyberspace should not be viewed as a disembodied media nor should identity be seen as a set of interchangeable, but separate components” (Dodge and Kitchin 24)

approaches to the study of cyberspace:  utopian (Graham and Marvin; Aronowitz; Morley and Robins; Mackenzie and Wajcman — technological determinism), social constructivism (Escobar, Penley and Ross, Haraway, etc.), political economy, postmodernism, feminism

“While our analysis is largely descriptive, we have sought to work within a social theoretical framework that marries aspects of social constructivism, political economy and postmodernism, thereby seeking to avoid the trap, as identified by Bingham (1999) of treating cyberspace as locations of the sublime (as powerful, dislocated, deterministic paraspaces)” (Dodge and Kitchin 27)

social construction operative as local scale; political economy at regional/global

rejects Bukatman’s sense that “a new and decentering spatiality has arisen that exists parallel to, but outside of, the geographic topography of experiential reality” (qtd on Dodge and Kitchin 27)

theorizing space:  space viewed as either absolute or relational (Newtonian/ Aristotelian v. Leibnizian/Kantian); argues for relational, constructed space

Batty, M.  “Virtual Geography.”  Futures 29.4/5 (1997):  337-352.

“Cyberspace has spatial and architectural forms that are dematerialised and dynamic; spaces that are not physically tangible, in that they can only be explored by the mind, yet metaphorically relate to bodily experience” (Dodge and Kitchin 30)

cartography of cyberspace collapses distinction between territory and map that represents it:  “spatialisations of cyberspace can be viewed and navigated in forms analogous to the ways in which people habitually navigate geographic space” (Dodge and Kitchin 30) —[true:  and yet it seems to me more important to note that what one is mapping is already itself a representation, and therefore the “map” becomes a second-order representation...]

2.  Geographies of the information society

“development and promotion of ICTs and cyberspace is bound to capitalist modes of production” (Dodge and Kitchin 32); “the dominant bases of the modernist agenda — enquiry, discovery, innovation, progress, internationalism, self and economic development — are still primcipals [sic] that underpin Western society” (Dodge and Kitchin 32)

critics argue that ICTs/cyberspace disrupt traditional cultural/social relations between place, community and identity in 3 ways:  global culturalization (undermines local); global corporate restructuring (creates mobility); alternative disembodied space

global culturalization:  McLuhan’s global village “will be used to transcend the differences between cultures and societies” (Dodge and Kitchin 33) — but it is “a village largely constructed and dominated by American desires, values, and practices” (Dodge and Kitchin 33) [see Sardar:  “Cyberspace is particularly geared up towards the erasure of all non-Western histories” (781; qtd on Dodge and Kitchin 33)]

“Cyberspace, it is contended, thus accelerates processes of placelessness by helping render obsolete the symbolic and cultural differences between places and by making (American) culture more mobile” (Dodge and Kitchin 34) — [I’d argue that cyberspace doesn’t do these things in ‘reality’ but instead effects them in American self-understanding:  we think ourselves global; we think ourselves everywhere]

Sorkin and the “city of simulation”

argues that such “globalising tendencies” (Dodge and Kitchin 34) are not totalized:  “The processes of globalisation, then, do not make the local and historical obsolete, instead, what we are seeing is a re-writing of city spaces developed during the Enlightenment and shaped by processes of modernism, imperialism, and colonialism” (Dodge and Kitchin 35)

place, community, identity

tends throughout to oppose “cyberspace” to “geographic space” while nonetheless arguing that cyberspace has geography

“Social networks maintained exclusively in cyberspace are thus not pale imitations of ‘real’ networks, or substitutions for these networks, they are simply another form of network...” (Dodge and Kitchin 35)

geographies of power:  for some, cyberspace disrupts “geometries of power”; for others, it deepens current geometries

effects of ICTs/cyberspace on political systems — do they, as Poster suggests, “represent a challenge to the whole notion of nation-states” (Dodge and Kitchin 37)?

control of nations over individuals weakened by cyberspace’s flow of info

but cyberspace can also be used for organizational purposes, both challenging and reinforcing hegemony — surveillance

“geographies of exclusion” — Poster (What’s the Matter...):  “the political geography of cyberspace effectively mirrors the prevailing patterns of global resource distribution” (qtd on Dodge and Kitchin 41) — digital divide

global movement of capital (Castells, Harvey); transnational corporations; telecommuting; employment restructuring; urban/regional restructuring

ICTs not producing “death of the city” but instead reinforcing role of city as business center — not only diffusion, but increased centralization — differences between “core” and “peripheral” cities heightened

“soft cities” — wired city scapes

“The outcome of many of these processes is increasing spatial and social divisions and the creation of a dual economy” (Dodge and Kitchin 48) — Davis; Castells

“two parallel space-economies” (Dodge and Kitchin 49) — the space of flows/ the space of places [***so maybe what I need to be arguing is that the erasure of geographic space is a privilege few can afford; how do I read the destruction of Randy’s home in this context?***]

3.  Geographies of cyberspace

“it is important to remember... that these spatialities and geometries merely constitute one part of our continuum of experience and as such should not be conceived as separate domains, disembodied and divorced from geographic space.” (Dodge and Kitchin 52)

ways cyberspace draws on material geography for metaphors

cyberspace produces changes in identity and social relations:  (1) cyborging; (2) disembodiment; (3) geographic dislocation

visible constructedness of subject in cyberspace; “irrelevance” of body, essential identity

[***claims that cyberspace creates new “egalitarian” communities that “are not based on what the participants look like, or where they live, but on what they thing, say, believe, and are interested in” (Dodge and Kitchin 54) miss the shift such new values reveal to an emphasis on cultural capital, which is always inevitably tied to political economy; also, such a shift reveals an elision, as Michele points out, between people and representations***]

Rheingold etc. argue that “cyberspace enables individuals to circumvent the geographical constraints of the material world” (Dodge and Kitchin 55)

Castells:  “real virtuality” — “a reality that is entirely captured by the medium of communication and where experience is communication” (Dodge and Kitchin 55)

Couclelis, “The Death of Distance” and “Worlds of Information” — cyberspace’s reliance on language/ideas of place

Adams (1998) on network topologies — deterministic relationship between network form and social interactions therein

online geographies of power and exclusion

spatial geometries of cyberspace — “qualitatively different” from lived space

Novak:  “liquid architecture”

Mitchell:  “the Net’s despatialization of interaction destroys the geocode’s key” (9; qtd on Dodge and Kitchin 62)

despite the fact that there’s no there there, “the space has a spatiality, a tangible geographic quality that fosters social relations” (Dodge and Kitchin 62)

Castells:  cyberspace as “space of flows characterized by timeless time and placeless space” (Dodge and Kitchin 62)

“There are no physical spaces in cyberspace, only individual digital traces that are all equally distant and accessible...” (Dodge and Kitchin 63)

geographic and topological concepts/metaphors in cyberspace design/navigation

4.  Introducing the cartographies of cyberspace

“geographically visualising ICTs (that is, mapping infrastructure and demographics onto a geographic framework) and metaphorically mapping cyberspace (using techniques of spatialisation to map information into spatial and temporal domains...)” (Dodge and Kitchin 65)

“maps themselves are not neutral, unproblematic artifacts but constitute systems of power-knowledge” (Dodge and Kitchin 69)

“As Bukatman notes, it is perhaps inevitable that both science-fiction writers (e.g., William Gibson...) and cyber cartographers use Cartesian mapping forms since ‘it reduces the infinite abstract void of electronic space to the definitions of bodily experience and physical cognition, grounding it in finite and assimilable terms’” (152, qtd on Dodge and Kitchin 71)

[***this suggests a turn to the empirical, which supports MW’s argument about the social-science bias of the spatial metaphor***]

5.  Mapping information and communication technologies

“Despite the massive growth of cyberspace in the last twenty years, the materiality that supports it, ICTs, is largely invisible” (Dodge and Kitchin 81) — [***as are the people and places that support it***]

examination of maps of infrastructure, of traffic, of temporal aspects of ICTs

maps of infrastructure:  “Although the nodes are located relatively accurately, the paths are mostly relational, designating a link between nodes, and not the exact geographic path of this link” (Dodge and Kitchin 82)

Zook 1998:  the “Internet industry exhibits a remarkable degree of clustering despite its reported spacelessness” (18, qtd on Dodge and Kitchin 89-90)

6.  Spatialising cyberspace

spatializations in which “data with no inherent spatial properties is mapped onto a defined spatial framework so that it might be better understood” (Dodge and Kitchin 107)

new research field:  information visualization

7.  Mapping asynchronous media

8.  Mapping synchronous social spaces

“As well as having spatial forms and geometries, AlphaWorld also exists within its own space-time geometry, adopting the time zone called AlphaWorld Standard Time (AWST).  The need for a special time zone arose because of the difficulty of scheduling meetings and events for inhabitants geographically located around the globe, and the confusion this caused as inhabitants tried to convert times into their local time zone.  In November 1996, a group of AlphaWorld activists designated AWST as Greenwich Men Time minus two hours.  This time zone, known as mid-Atlantic, is not used by any country in the real world.  Subsequently, it has been adopted by other synchronous virtual communities, and has recently been renamed Virtual Reality Time (VRT).” (Dodge and Kitchin 160)

9.  Spatial cognition of cyberspace

cognitive mapping

10.  Imaginative mappings of cyberspace

very weird social-science approach to reading cyberpunk

“In Gibson’s Sprawl trilogy, in cyberspace there is no ‘space’, no places and thus no spatiality.  Cyberspace is merely a distributed, corporate information system that uses a spatial metaphor as its interface and which is accessed individually.  The spatial metaphor is used solely to aid navigation and provide a tangible interface to data constructs too difficult to comprehend otherwise.... It is only in Gibson’s later books, Virtual Light and Idoru, that individuals meet and interact in cyberspace, using the medium as an alternative social space.  However, it is this use of cyberspace as a social space that problematises the notion of it as somewhere that is placeless and spaceless.  As soon as people use the non-space of cyberspace to interact it gains a spatiality...” (Dodge and Kitchin 199-200).

11.  Future mappings of cyberspace

agendas for future studies

“In a sense, rather than merely ask the question, ‘to what extent is geographic space made placeless by cyberspace?’, we also need to ask, ‘to what extend is geographic space placed through cyberspace?’” (Dodge and Kitchin 211)
