“Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America.” June 2004. National Endowment for the Arts. <http://arts.gov/publications/reading-risk-survey-literary-reading-america-0>


Preface, Dana Gioia

"This comprehensive survey of American literary reading presents a detailed but bleak assessment of the decline of reading’s role in the nation’s culture. For the first time in modern history, less than half of the adult population now reads literature, and these trends reflect a larger decline in other sorts of reading" (NEA vii)

"Reading a book requires a degree of active attention and engagement. Indeed, reading itself is a progressive skill that depends on years of education and practice. By contrast, most electronic media such as television, recordings, and radio make fewer demands on their audiences, and indeed often require no more than passive participation. Even interactive electronic media, such as video games and the Internet, foster shorter attention spans and accelerated gratification" (NEA vii)

"While oral culture has a rich immediacy that is not to be dismissed, and electronic media offer the considerable advantages of diversity and access, print culture affords irreplaceable forms of focused attention and contemplation that make complex communications and insights possible. To lose such intellectual capability – and the many sorts of human continuity it allows – would constitute a vast cultural impoverishment" (NEA vii)

"readers play a more active and involved role in their communities. The decline in reading, therefore, parallels a larger retreat from participation in civic and cultural life" (NEA vii)


Executive Summary

"The survey asked respondents if, during the previous twelve months, they had read any novels, short stories, plays, or poetry in their leisure time (not for work or school).  The report establishes trends in the number of adults reading, listening to, and writing literature by demographic categories of age, race, region, income, and education.  This report also compares participation in literary activities with other leisure activities, such as watching movies and exercising" (NEA ix)

"Reading at Risk provides an invaluable snapshot of the role of literature in the lives of Americans.  It comes at a critical time, when electronic media are becoming the dominant influence in young people’s worlds. Reading at Risk adds new and distressing information to the discussion.  It contains solid evidence of the declining importance of literature to our populace.  Literature reading is fading as a meaningful activity, especially among younger people. If one believes that active and engaged readers lead richer intellectual lives than non-readers and that a well-read citizenry is essential to a vibrant democracy, the decline of literary reading calls for serious action" (NEA ix)

"Less than half of the adult American population now reads literature" (NEA ix)

"The decline in literary reading parallels a decline in total book reading" (NEA ix)

"Women read more literature than men do, but literary reading by both groups is declining at significant rates" (NEA x)

"The steepest decline in literary reading is in the youngest age groups" (NEA xi)

"The decline in reading correlates with increased participation in a variety of electronic media, including the Internet, video games, and portable digital devices" (NEA xii)

"Literature now competes with an enormous array of electronic media.  While no single activity is responsible for the decline of reading, the cumulative presence and availability of these alternatives have increasingly drawn Americans away from reading" (NEA xii)

"The accelerating declines in literary reading among all demographic groups of American adults indicate an imminent cultural crisis. The trends among younger adults warrant special concern, suggesting that – unless some effective solution is found – literary culture, and literacy in general, will continue to worsen.  Indeed, at the current rate of loss, literary reading as a leisure activity will virtually disappear in half a century" (NEA xiii)


Chapter 1: Introduction

"The question of who reads is one of particular social importance. Reading is both a reflection of disparate education levels and a way of bridging the differences among them. Reading is obviously related to the literacy of a nation, which in turn is related to the quality of life of its citizens.  If literacy is the baseline for participation in social life, then reading – and reading of literary work in particular – is essential to a sound and healthy understanding of, and participation in, a democratic society" (NEA 1)

"Levels of public participation in literature also matter to the economic vitality of the publishing industry" (NEA 1)

SPPA = Survey of Public Participation in the Arts

"The 2002 SPPA asked respondents if, during the past 12 months, they had read any novels or short stories, plays, or poetry.  A positive response to any of those three categories is counted as reading literature, including popular genres such as mysteries, as well as contemporary and classic literary fiction.  No distinctions were drawn on the quality of literary works" (NEA 1-2)

"The distinction between reading literary works and reading any books is important to the analysis presented in this report. Books can be of any type and cover a vast array of subjects, literary and non-literary alike, and for the purposes of the survey, the respondents need to have read as a leisure time activity, not for work or school.
     Literature, of course, can be found in sources other than books.  Poetry, drama, and fiction can be read in magazines and literary journals, even on subway and bus placards" (NEA 2)
 

Chapter 2:  Literature Participation in 2002

"Given the increasing importance of the Internet as a tool for the arts, the 2002 SPPA asked respondents whether they use the Internet to learn about, read, or discuss topics related to literature. About 9 percent of adults (or 19 million people) said they had" (NEA 4)

"of the activities included in the 2002 SPPA, only TV watching, moviegoing, and exercising attract significantly more people than reading literary works" (NEA 5)

"literary readers are nearly three times as likely to attend a performing arts event, almost four times as likely to visit an art museum, over two-and-a-half times as likely to do volunteer or charity work, over one-and-a-half times as likely to attend sporting events, and over one-and-a-half times as likely to participate in sports activities. In fact, people who read larger numbers of books tend to have the highest levels of participation in other activities, especially arts activities" (NEA 5)


Chapter 3: Factors in Literary Reading

"A number of demographic, lifestyle, and other factors influence literature participation. Knowledge of these factors is important both to understand current readership and to develop readers in different demographic groups. On one hand, statistics demonstrate that literary reading varies significantly by gender, ethnicity, race, education, and other variables. On the other hand, literary reading varies somewhat less by age and family income" (NEA 9) -- this is an extremely selective reading of the statistics.  To suggest that literary reading varies "significantly" by race [with whites on the upper end of the scale, at 51.4 percent, and "Hispanics" on the lower end, at 28.5 percent], but then to suggest that reading varies "somewhat less" by family income [from 32.1 percent for those with an income of less than $10K/year, to 60.8 percent for those with an income of $75K/year], misses the point rather broadly, demonstrating the ways that the report seems determined to pin reading (or the lack there of) to qualities that are either personal or "cultural" in a sense that lends itself to value judgments and exhortations about individual responsibility, rather than considering the role that the mere presence or absence of leisure time might play in rates of reading.  Something in the government's strong determination to avoid any sense of collective responsibility, and thus to play down the role of income in this study?  Note that, in this chapter, there are graphs breaking out the roles of age, education, region, but nothing to illustrate the difference that economics makes.  Also, where education is considered, the only factor examined is the level of "personal attainment," and not the quality of the education received.

"Despite the relative consistency in reading among the different age groups, the fact that the youngest age group has the lowest literary reading rate raises questions about the future of literary reading in America. Is this an indication of a decline in reading, possibly due to competition from TV, videogames, movies, and the Internet? Or is it simply a 'natural' function of the fact that younger people are temporarily preoccupied with other types of reading (textbooks and coursework) or other leisure activities?" (NEA 10-11)

"only 14 percent of those with grade school education read novels, short stories, poetry, or plays in 2002. Those with a graduate school education are more than five times (74 percent) more likely to read literary works. In between these two extremes, literary reading increases consistently at every educational level, with literature participation rates for those with various levels of educational attainment" (NEA 12)

"People in managerial, professional, and technical occupations are more likely to read literature than those in other occupation groups" (NEA 13) -- well, duh.  The "other occupation groups" are sales, service, and "production, craft, repair, operator"...

"Does TV watching affect literary reading? This is a key question posed by many who feel that today’s frequent TV watchers may not read as much as previous generations have" (NEA 14)

"literary readers watch an average of 2.7 hours of TV per day, while people who do not read literary works watch an average of 3.1 hours of TV per day. Not surprisingly, a statistical model created to analyze frequent readers found that watching four hours or more of TV per day had a negative impact on the chances of someone reading 12 books or more per year. Watching no TV had a positive impact on the probability of someone reading 12 books or more. Overall, however, frequent readers watch only slightly less TV per day than infrequent readers" (NEA 15)

"A 2001 Gallup survey of 512 people showed that regular computer users spent 1.5 hours per day using the Internet and 1.1 hours reading books. However, those who did not regularly use a computer also spent 1.1 hours per day reading a book" (NEA 15)

"Although 46.7 percent of the adult population read literature in 2002, a comparable percentage of adults may not have been capable of reading and understanding most novels, short stories, poetry, or plays.  A 1995 report from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) shows that 45 percent of adults read at 'prose literacy levels' one and two. Rather than reporting a single illiteracy rate, NCES classifies adults into five levels of literacy.  People scoring at levels one and two probably do not have the skills necessary to read many types of literature" (NEA 15)

***In the section "Demographic Characteristics of Frequent Readers," statistical information is presented about these most valorized individuals, including their likely gender, race/ethnicity, age, level of education, level of parents' education, presence in the labor force, participation in other cultural activities, participation in volunteer and charity work, and television watching habits, but income level is entirely omitted [see NEA 16].***

"about one in 14 people (7 percent) said that they wrote creative works during the survey year. As is the case with all facets of literary reading and writing, women are more likely than men to pursue creative writing. Similarly, creative writing is most popular among those with high education levels and among residents of the western region of the country.
     However, an analysis of creative writers shows some differences between the demographic characteristics of creative writers and literary readers (see Table 16).  Interestingly, creative writing does not increase consistently by income levels. Low- and middle-income people are about as likely to write creative works as those with high incomes.  Other comparisons of the data show that African Americans are as likely as white Americans to do creative writing. In addition, creative writing is most common among those under 25" (NEA 18-19)


Chapter 4: Trends in Literature Participation, 1982-2002

begins with demographic change, and particularly the growth in minority populations!  Is this the most important factor in the decline of reading? -- "The changing demographics of the United States ensure continued change in literary and artistic circles and in public participation in literature and the arts" (NEA 21)

immediately behind this comes technological change:  "In 1982, personal computers were a relatively new phenomenon, and the Internet was a small network. Now, computers and the Internet are readily available in many homes and in most workplaces. Videogames have also proliferated since the early 1980s, a time when Atari sets were fairly new. These changes, along with the growth in network, cable, and satellite television and the advent of video rentals, have had a significant impact on people’s time use over the past 20 years. As early as the 1980s, fears were expressed that the U.S. was becoming a 'nation of watchers' rather than a 'nation of readers.'" (NEA 21)

"Contrary to the overall decline in literary reading, the number of people doing creative writing – of any genre, not exclusively literary works – increased substantially between 1982 and 2002. In 1982, about 11 million people did some form of creative writing. By 2002, this number had risen to almost 15 million people (18 or older), an increase of about 30 percent" (NEA 22)

"A comparison of the 1982, 1992, and 2002 Surveys of Public Participation in the Arts shows that time spent watching TV has remained stable for those 18 and older. In 1982 and 1992, the average amount of TV watched per day was 3.0 hours. This decreased slightly to 2.9 hours per day in 2002. These figures suggest that TV watching may not be an important factor in the overall decrease in literary reading" (NEA 27)


Chapter 5: Summary and Conclusions

"As discussed in Chapter 3, television does not seem to be the culprit.  In 2002, those who do read and those who do not read literature watched about the same amount of TV per day – three hours’ worth. The Internet, however, could have played a role. During the time period when the literature participation rates declined, home Internet use soared. According to a 2000 Census Bureau report, 42 percent of households used the Internet at home – up dramatically from 26  percent in 1998, one of the earliest years of the Bureau’s tracking. By contrast, literary reading rates reported in 1982 and 1992 were virtually identical in a period before the Internet was widely available.  It was not until 2002 that the reported percentage of adults reading literature dropped considerably
     Also, home Internet users have a similar profile to literary readers.  They are likely to be well educated (bachelor’s degree or higher) and belong to the age group whose reading rates show the greatest percentage drop.  Home Internet use was the greatest (50.2 percent) for people ages 25-44.  However, this pattern of falling literary reading rates timed with rising home Internet use may only be coincidental. The SPPA did not ask if people substituted Internet surfing for reading literary works" (NEA 30)

Second major conclusion:  it's Hispanics' fault!:  "Over the 20-year span of this analysis, Hispanics doubled their share of the total U.S. population, rising from 6.4 percent of the total in 1980 to 12.5 percent in 2003. At the same time, the 2002 SPPA reports that the literary reading rate for Hispanics was only half that of non-Hispanic whites.  So, the dramatic population growth of Hispanics may have contributed to lower literary reading rates for the adult population as a whole. 
    But this assumption has shortcomings.  If Hispanic populations were a significant reason for falling rates of literary reading, presumably the SPPA would have reported heavier decreases in literary reading by adults with lower levels of education (given that education levels are lower for Hispanics). Instead, the survey reports that literary reading fell among all education levels.  Still, population growth for this ethnic group is considerable.  For this reason alone, arts agencies and policy makers may want to target Hispanics for programs to raise literary reading rates" (NEA 30)

"Newspaper and magazine articles about post-September 11 developments and the war in Afghanistan may have hindered literary reading during the survey year" (NEA 30) -- ???
