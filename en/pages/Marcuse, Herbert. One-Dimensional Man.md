Marcuse, Herbert. One-Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society. Boston: Beacon Press, 1964.


"Our society distinguishes itself by conquering forces with Technology rather than Terror..." (Marcuse x)

technology in advanced industrial society undermines all critique:  "Technical progress, extended to a whole system of domination and coordination, creates forms of life (and of power) which appear to reconcile the forces opposing the system and to defeat or refute all protest in the name of the historical prospects of freedom from toil and domination" (Marcuse xii)

the "containment of social change is perhaps the most singular achievement of advanced industrial society" (Marcuse xii); no remaining meeting ground for theory and practice; Marxian contradictions are no more

two contradictory hypotheses:  that advanced industrial society can contain change; that forces exist that may explode the society

in advanced industrial society, the apparatus of production functions as a system that determines its own products as well as its own maintenance

"Technology serves to institute new, more effective, and more pleasant forms of social control and social cohesion" (Marcuse xv)

"In the face of the totalitarian features of this society, the traditional notion of the 'neutrality' of technology can no longer be maintained.  Technology as such cannot be isolated from the use to which it is put; the technologized society is a system of domination which operates already in the concept and construction of techniques" (Marcus xvi)

as technological universe, advanced industrial society is *political*; engaged in historical project of the transformation of nature into the stuff of domination

"In the medium of technology, culture, politics, and the economy merge into an omnipresent system which swallows up or repulses all alternatives" (Marcuse xvi)

I.  One-Dimensional Society

1:  The New Forms of Control

"A comfortable, smooth, reasonable, democratic unfreedom prevails in advanced industrial civilization, a token of technical progress" (Marcuse 1)

uselessness of nonconformity in a society with a rising standard of living (society capable of "delivering the goods" is capable of absorbing and containing all dissent)

economic freedom would truly be freedom *from* the economy; likewise, "intellectual freedom would mean the restoration of individual thought now absorbed by mass communication and indoctrination" (Marcuse 4)

false needs imposed on individual in order to repress, including the need to "behave and consume in accordance with the advertisements" (Marcuse 5)

new technologies as means of control, including media

technological rationalization "makes the very notion of alienation questionable.  The people recognize themselves in their commodities" (Marcuse 9)

no longer any free "inner Self" -- "Today this private space has been invaded and whittled down by technological reality" (Marcuse 10)

contemporary society is more ideological than ever before:  "The means of mass transportation and communication, the commodities of lodging, food, and clothing, the irresistable output of the entertainment and information industry carry with them prescribed attitudes and habits, certain intellectual and emotional reactions which bind the consumers more or less pleasantly to the producers and, through the latter, to the whole" (Marcuse 12)

indoctrination as a way of life; pattern emerges of *one-dimensional* thought and behavior in which opposing/transcendant terms are negated/absorbed

2:  The Closing of the Political Universe

"the society of total mobilization" -- media as one tool

containment of social change:  "the capacity to contain and manipulate subversive imagination and effort is an integral part of the given society" (Marcuse 23)

vast transformation of the laboring classes:  (1) "Mechanization is increasingly reducing the quantity and intensity of physical energy expended in labor" (Marcuse 24) -- producing a sort of rhythmic automatism; (2) "The assimilating trend shows forth in the occupational stratification" (Marcuse 27) -- a change in the basic character of instruments of production from human to machine; (3) "These changes in the character of work and the instruments of production change the attitude and consciousness of the laborer, which become manifest in the widely discussed 'social and cultural integration' of the laboring class with capitalist society" (Marcuse 29); (4) "The new technological work-world thus enforces a weakening of the negative position of the working class:  the latter no longer appears to be the living contradiction to the established society" (Marcuse 31)

thus, domination becomes administration and "the technological veil conceals the reproduction of inequality and enslavement" (Marcuse 32)

prospects of containment:  "The more the rulers are capable of delivering the goods of consumption, the more firmly will the underlying population be tied to the various ruling bureaucracies" (Marcuse 43)

the welfare and warfare state:  "Advertising, public relations, indoctrination, planned obsolescence are no longer unproductive overhead costs but rather elements of basic production costs" (Marcuse 49)

democracy as the most efficient system of domination

3:  The Conquest of the Unhappy Consciousness:  Repressive Desublimation

corresponding integration in the realm of culture:  "the progress of technological rationality is liquidating the oppositional and transcending elements in the 'higher culture'.... What is happening now is not the deterioration of higher culture into mass culture but the refutation of this culture by the reality" (Marcuse 56)

"Today's novel feature is the flattening out of the antagonism between culture and social reality through the obliteration of the oppositional, alien, and transcendent elements in higher culture... not through the denial and rejection of the 'cultural values,' but through their wholesale incorporation into the established order, through their reproduction and display on a massive scale" (Marcuse 57)

desublimation of art:  "Higher culture becomes part of the material culture.  In this transformation, it loses the greater part of its truth" (Marcuse 58)

artistic alienation as "conscious transcendence of the alienated existence" (Marcuse 60) -- "The absorbent power of society depletes the artistic dimenion by assimilating its antagonistic contents" (Marcuse 61) -- undermines the very basis of artistic alienation, invalidating the very substance of art

"The works of alienation are themselves incorporated into this society and circulate as part and parcel of the equipment which adorns and psychoanalyzes the prevailing state of affairs.  Thus they become commercials -- they sell, comfort, or excite" (Marcuse 64)

"the total mobilization of all media for the defense of the established reality has coordinated the means of expression to the point where communication of transcending contents becomes technically impossible" (Marcuse 68)

"Invalidating the cherished images of transcendence by incorporating them into its omnipresent daily reality, this society testifies to the extent to which insoluble conflicts are becoming manageable -- to which tragedy and romance, archetypal dreams and anxieties are being made susceptible to technical solution and dissolution" (Marcuse 70-71)

desublimation:  "replacing mediated by immediate gratification" (Marcuse 72); repressive desublimation:  "Thus diminishing erotic and intensifying sexual energy, the technological reality *limits the scope of sublimation*.  It also reduces the *need* for sublimation" (Marcuse 73) -- sublimation produces unhappy consciousness; repressive desublimation produces happy consciousness which is accepting of society

4:  The Closing of the Universe of Discourse

technological rationality in language; functionalization of language makes it impossible to speak of "concepts" -- "an abridgement of meaning which has a political connotation" (Marcuse 87)

functional language as "radically anti-historical language" (Marcuse 98)

"The new touch of the magic-ritual language rather is that people don't believe it, or don't care, and yet act accordingly" (Marcuse 103)

functionalization of "concepts" down to individual cases makes it impossible to speak of generalities, of classes -- thus, there can be no collective

II.  One-Dimensional Thought

5:  Negative Thinking:  The Defeated Logic of Protest

"the antagonistic structure of reality, and of thought trying to understand reality" (Marcuse 123)

"the process by which logic became the logic of domination" (Marcuse 123)

critical tension between "is" and "ought" as ontological condition (theory), which intends a concrete *practice*

6:  From Negative to Positive Thinking:  Technological Rationality and the Logic of Domination

"the society which projects and undertakes the technological transformation of nature alters the base of domination by gradually replacing personal dependence... with dependence on the 'objective order of things'" (Marcuse 144)

the methodological origins of the new rationality; the point where theoretical Reason turns into social practice

no more "ought":  "The unscientific character of these ideas fatally weakens the opposition to the established reality; the ideas become mere *ideals*, and their concrete, critical content evaporates into the ethical or metaphysical atmosphere" (Marcuse 148)

"when technics becomes the universal form of material production, it circumscribes an entire culture; it projects a historical totality -- a 'world'" (Marcuse 154)

"science, *by virtue of its own method* and concepts, has projected and promoted a universe in which the domination of nature has remained linked to the domination of man -- a link which tends to be fatal to this universe as a whole" (Marcuse 166)

"In the construction of the technological reality, there is no such thing as a purely rational scientific order; the process of technological rationality is a political process... technology has become the great vehicel of reification" (Marcuse 168)

7:  The Triumph of Positive Thinking:  One-Dimensional Philosophy

"The emphasis is on the *therapeutic* function of philosophical analysis" (Marcuse 170)

positivism:  "(1) the validation of cognitive thought by experience of facts; (2) the orientation of cognitive thought to the physical sciences as a model of certainty and exactness; (3) the belief that progress in knowledge depends on this orientation" (Marcuse 172)

"such statements [of the inefficacy of philosophy] exhibit, to my mind, academic sado-masochism, self-humiliation, and self-denunciation of the intellectual whose labor does not issue in scientific, technical, or like achievements" (Marcuse 173)

"The transformation of critical into positive thinking takes place mainly in the therapeutic treatment of universal concepts" (Marcuse 183)

"The process of civilization invalidates myth... but it may also return rational thought to mythological status" (Marcuse 188)

"If it is meaningful to say that the ideology comes to be embodied in the process of production itself, it may also be meaningful to suggest that, in this society, the rational rather than the irrational becomes the most effective vehicle of mystification" (Marcuse 189)

III.  The Chance of the Alternatives

8:  The Historical Commitment of Philosophy

"the treatment of universals reveals the position of a philosophy in the intellectual culture -- its historical function" (Marcuse 203)

truth and freedom of negative thinking in philosophy's struggle against established society

all philosophy has an historical (i.e., ideological) project

9:  The Catastrophe of Liberation

"The tolerance of positive thinking is enforced tolerance -- enforced not by any terroristic agency but by the overwhelming, anonymous power and efficiency of the technological society" (Marcuse 226)

if technical progress were shifted to the pacification of the struggle for existence, catastrophe would ensue for established society

"The question has ceased to be irresponsible since the 'affluent society' has become a society of permanent mobilization against the risk of annihilation, and since the sale of its goods has been accompanied by moronization, the perpetuation of toil, and the promotion of frustration" (Marcuse 242)

expansion of technological rationality has "invaded the inner space of privacy" (Marcuse 244); privacy, necessary to freedom, "has long since become the most expensive commodity" (Marcuse 244)

Marcuse's example of how to fix all this -- get rid of "all indoctrinating media of information and entertainment" (Marcuse 245):  "while the people can suport the continuous creation of nuclear weapons, radioactive fallout, and questionable foodstuffs, they cannot (for this very reason!) tolerate being deprived of the entertainment and education which make them capable of reproducign the arrangements for their defense and/or destruction.  The non-functioning of television and the allied media might thus begin to achieve what the inherent contradictions of capitalism did not achieve -- the disintegration of the system" (Marcuse 246)

10:  Conclusion

"Thus the question once again must be faced:  how can the administered individuals -- who have made their mutilation into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scale -- liberate themselves from themselves as well as from their masters?" (Marcuse 250-51)

how to do this:  must develop radically new historical Subject
