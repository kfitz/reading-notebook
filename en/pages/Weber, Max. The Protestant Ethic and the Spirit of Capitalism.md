Weber, Max. The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. 1958.  New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1976.


INTRODUCTION

exploration of the combination of circumstances which led to the development of rational Western institutions:  theology, history, music, architecture, government, *capitalism*

capitalism ≠ impulse to acquisition of money; capitalism = “pursuit of profit, and forever renewed profit, by means of continuous, rational, capitalistic enterprise.” (Weber 17)

defining terms:  capitalistic economic action = action which rests on expectation of profit by utilization of opportunities for exchange

“a calculation of capital in terms of money is always made” (Weber 18)

“an actual adaptation of economic action to a comparison of money income with money expenses” (Weber 19)

capitalism most developed in the West in terms of both quantity and quality

uniquely Western form: “the rational capitalistic organization of (formally) free labour” (Weber 21)

“The modern rational organization of the capitalistic enterprise would not have been possible without two other important factors in its development: the separation of business from the household, which completely dominates modern economic life, and closely connected with it, rational book-keeping.” (Weber 21-22)

“the central problem for us is not, in the last analysis, even from a purely economic view-point, the development of capitalistic activity as such . . . It is rather the origin of this sober bourgeois capitalism with its rational organization of free labour.  Or in terms of cultural history, the problem is that of the origin of the Western bourgeois class” (Weber 23-24)

“the specific and peculiar rationalism of Western culture” (Weber 26)

ethical ideas of duty based on religious principles as most important formative influences

“connection of the spirit of modern economic life with the rational ethics of ascetic Protestantism” (Weber 27)

PART I: THE PROBLEM
CHAPTER I: RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION AND SOCIAL STRATIFICATION

business leaders as overwhelmingly Protestant?

Reformation not as elimination of Church control, but rather as substitution of new form of control

Calvinism as unbearable form of control of individual?

“Now how does it happen that at that time those countries which were most advanced economically, and within them the rising bourgeois middle classes, not only failed to resist this unexampled tyranny of Puritanism, but even developed a heroism in its defence?” (Weber 37)

“the supposed conflict between other-worldliness, asceticism, and ecclesiastical piety on the one side, and participation in capitalistic acquisition on the other, might actually turn out to be an intimate relationship” (Weber 42)

Calvinism as “seed-bed of capitalistic economy” (Weber 43)?

connection of religious way of life with development of business acumen

CHAPTER II: THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM

spirit of capitalism? document of the spirit shown in long quotes from Ben Franklin

philosophy of avarice; “a duty of the individual toward the increase of his capital, which is assumed as an end in itself . . . it is an ethos.  This is the quality which interests us.” (Weber 51)

spirit of capitalism as ethically colored maxims for conduct of life

utilitarianism: virtues are virtues because they assure credit

making of money/acquisition as ultimate purpose of life; end in itself, not means to an end

asking why it should be so results in religious/Biblical answers

“The earning of money within the modern economic order is, so long as it is done legally, the result and expression of virtue and proficiency in a calling” (Weber 53-54)

economic survival of the fittest

“the origin and history of such ideas is much more important than the theorists of the superstructure suppose” (Weber 56) — see Althusser

traditionalism v. capitalism:  in traditionalism, a man “does not ‘by nature’ wish to earn more and more money, but simply to live as he is accustomed to live and to earn as much as is necessary for that purpose.” (Weber 60)

spirit of capitalism:  “Labour must, on the contrary, be performed as if it were an absolute end in itself, a calling.  But such an attitude is by no means a product of nature.  It cannot be evoked by low wages or high ones alone, but can only be the product of a long and arduous process of education.” (Weber 62)

spirit of capitalism = “that attitude which seeks profit rationally and systematically in the manner which we have illustrated by the example of Benjamin Franklin.” (Weber 64)

ascetic tendency of life of the capitalist

transformation of capitalist activity from one barely ethically tolerated into a “calling”

development of the spirit of capitalism as part of development of rationalism on the whole?

“Rationalism is an historical concept which covers a whole world of different things.  It will be our task to find out whose intellectual child the particular concrete form of rational thought was, from which the idea of a calling and the devotion to labour in the calling has grown.” (Weber 78)

CHAPTER III: LUTHER’S CONCEPTION OF THE CALLING

idea of calling not present in Catholicism, but present for all Protestant peoples

product of the Reformation; new: fulfillment of duty in worldly affairs as highest form of moral activity; gave everyday worldly activity a religious significance

labor in a calling as outward expression of brotherly love

moral justification of worldly activity

O.T. on worldly affairs: traditionalistic; ‘let the godless run after gain’

“in the concrete calling an individual pursued he saw more and more a special command of God to fulfill these particular duties which the Divine Will had imposed upon him.” (Weber 84-85)

for Luther, idea of calling remained traditionalistic; divine ordinance; remaining content with one’s lot

“the ethical peculiarities of Calvinism” (Weber 87)

Milton, Paradise Lost, on the expulsion:  “The world was all before them”

relationship between the Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism in Puritan sects

multiple causality: “we are merely trying to clarify the part which religious forces have played in forming the developing web of our specifically worldly modern culture, in the complex interaction of innumerable different historical factors.” (Weber 90)

PART II: THE PRACTICAL ETHICS OF THE ASCETIC BRANCHES OF PROTESTANTISM
CHAPTER IV: THE RELIGIOUS FOUNDATIONS OF WORLDLY ASCETICISM

four principal forms of ascetic Protestantism:  Calvinism, Pietism, Methodism, Baptist sects

connection of moral practice with idea of afterlife which dominated spiritual men

A. CALVINISM

doctrine of predestination as most characteristic dogma

total absence of will in matters of salvation; predestination of elect and damned

phenomenon of religious sense of grace combined with certainty that grace was sole product of object power (and not at all to be attributed to personal worth)

complete elimination of “magical” power of Church and sacraments

“The elected Christian is in the world only to increase this glory of God by fulfilling His commandments to the best of his ability.  But God requires social achievement of the Christian because he wills that social life shall be organized according to his commandments” (Weber 108)

recognizability of outward signs of one’s state of grace became hugely important

two types of pastoral advice: must consider oneself chosen, as doubts are sign of lack of grace; intense worldly activity as best means of achieving self-confidence

how could true faith be identified? by Christian conduct which increases the glory of God

good works useless for attaining salvation, but indispensible as a sign of election

not individual good works of Catholic, but unified system of good works

rational character of Christian asceticism; active self-control

transformation in Calvinism of asceticism to activity within the world (rather than monasticism)

B. PIETISM

doctrine of predestination also as starting point for Pietism

intensification of asceticism; emphasis so strongly on praxis that doctrine was pushed into b.g.

stricter ascetic control of conduct in the calling

two ideas: (1) methodical development of one’s state of grace to a higher degree was sign of grace; (2) God gives signs to those in state of grace

Terminism: grace offered to all men, but often only once, and then never again

“even though a man himself could not, others could know his state of grace by his conduct” (Weber 135)

virtues favored by Pietism were those of laborer; virtues of Calvinism were those of entrepreneur

C. METHODISM

Anglo-American movement corresponding to Continental Pietism

“methodical, systematic nature of conduct for the purpose of attaining the certitudo salutis” (Weber 139)

method used to bring about emotional act of conversion

works not the cause, but the means of knowing one’s state of grace

rational struggle for perfection; “The regeneration of Methodism thus created only a supplement to the pure doctrine of works, a religious basis for ascetic conduct after the doctrine of predestination had been given up.” (Weber 143)

D. THE BAPTIST SECTS

second independent source of Protestant asceticism; Baptists, Mennonites, Quakers

believer’s Church; sect with only the reborn; only adults who have gained their faith are baptized

strict avoidance of the world; repudiated all idolatry of the flesh

“carried out the most radical devaluation of all sacraments as means to salvation, and thus accomplished the religious rationalization of the world in its most extreme form” (Weber 147)

blameless conduct of members of sects

withdrawal from world of political powers led to increase of interest in economic occupations?

“the decisive point was, to recapitulate, the conception of the state of religious grace, common to all denominations, as a status which marks off its possessor from the degradation of the flesh” (Weber 153)

CHAPTER V: ASCETICISM AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM

“The real moral objection is to relaxation in the security of possession, the enjoyment of wealth with the consequence of idleness and the temptations of the flesh, above all of distraction from the pursuit of a righteous life.  In fact, it is only because possession involves this danger of relaxation that it is objectionable at all.” (Weber 157)

labor as approved ascetic technique

wealth does not exempt one from duty to work at one’s calling

providential character in play of economic interests: “It is true that the usefulness of a calling, and thus its favour in the sight of God, is measured primarily in moral terms, and thus in terms of the importance of the goods produced in it for the community.  But a further, and, above all, in practice the most important, criterion is found in private profitableness.  For if that God, whose hand the Puritan sees in all the occurrences of life, shows one of His elect a chance of profit, he must do it with a purpose.” (Weber 162)

ethical justification of modern specialized division of labor; also of distinctions between classes

differences between Jewish and Protestant capitalist ethics

“The theatre was obnoxious to the Puritans, and with the strict exclusion of the erotic and of nudity from the realm of toleration, a radical view of either literature or art could not exist . . . deciding in favour of sober utility as against any artistic tendencies” (Weber 169) — Hollywood!

in asceticism, pursuit of wealth as its own end is reprehensible, but attainment of it in a calling is a sign of God’s blessing

“What the great religious epoch of the seventeenth century bequeathed to its utilitarian successor was, however, above all an amazingly good, we may even say a pharisaically good, conscience in the acquistion of money, so long as it took place legally.” (Weber 176)

“the comforting assurance that the unequal distribution of goods in the world was a special dispensation of Divine Providence” (Weber 177)
