Mitchell, W.J.T. Picture Theory: Essays on Verbal and Visual Representation.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994.


INTRODUCTION

problem of 21st century is the problem of the image

tensions between verbal and visual representation as inseparable from cultural/political struggle

division between “word” and “image” does not simplify into “television” and “book”; mass/elite

“all media are mixed media” (Mitchell 5)

need to “picture” theory: “We are surrounded by pictures; we have an abundance of theories about them, but it doesn’t seem to do us any good.” (Mitchell 5-6)


I. PICTURE THEORY

ONE: THE PICTORIAL TURN

“The very notion of a theory of pictures suggests an attempt to master the field of visual representation with a verbal discourse.  But suppose we reversed the power relations of ‘discourse’ and ‘field’ and attempted to picture theory?” (Mitchell 9)

the pictorial turn (c.f. Rorty’s linguistic turn)

“in what is often characterized as an age of ‘spectacle’ (Guy Debord), ‘surveillance’ (Foucault), and all-pervasive image-making, we still do not know exactly what pictures are, what their relation to language is, how they operate on observers and on the world, how their history is to be understood, and what is to be done with or about them.” (Mitchell 13)

images made increasingly powerful in postmodern era; corresponding growth in fear of images

pictorial turn as “postsemiotic rediscovery of the picture” (Mitchell 16)

problems of spectatorship as deep as problems of reading

Erwin Panofsky; Jonathan Crary (Techniques of the Observer)

Althusser’s theory of ideology

subjecting ideology to an iconological analysis (picturing theory)

“The main importance of recognition as the link between ideology and iconology is that is shifts both ‘sciences’ from an epistemological ‘cognitive’ ground (the knowledge of objects by subjects) to an ethical, political, and hermeneutic ground (the knowledge of subjects by subjects, perhaps even Subjects by Subjects).” (Mitchell 33)

“Panofsky reminds us that Althusser’s local instances of ideology, the greeting of subject with subject (s/s), are all staged within a hall of mirrors constructed by the sovereign Subject (S/s) and that the ideological critique is in danger of being nothing more than another iconology.” (Mitchell 34)

TWO: METAPICTURES

pictures about pictures; pictures used to show what a picture is; self-referentiality; self-analysis

do pictures provide their own metalanguage?

three basic kinds:  “the picture that represents itself, creating a referential circle or mise en abime” (Mitchell 56); the generically self-referential kind, the picture about pictures; the picture that involves discursive or contextual self-reference, the multistable picture

“Metapictures are notoriously migratory, moving from popular culture to science, philosophy ot art history, shifting from positions as illustrations or ornaments to centrality and canonicity.  They don’t just illustrate theories of picturing and vision: they show us what vision is, and picture theory.” (Mitchell 57)

Velazquez’s Las Meninas as meta-metapicture

Magritte’s “Ceci n’est pas une pipe” as picture of the gap between words and pictures

metapictures as pictures of theory

THREE: BEYOND COMPARISON: PICTURE, TEXT, AND METHOD

metapictures reveal “the inextricable weaving together of representation and discourse, the imbrication of visual and verbal experience” (Mitchell 83)

the problem of the “imagetext” as a symptom of the impossibility of a theory of pictures?

traditional answer: comparative study of “Sister Arts”; oversimplifies relationship; shows bias

“comparison itself is not a necessary procedure in the study of image-text relations.  The necessary subject matter is, rather, the whole emsemble of relations between media, and relations can be many other things besides similarity, resemblance, and analogy.” (Mitchell 89)

“The best preventive to comparative methods is an insistence on literalness and materiality.” (Mitchell 90)

“The real question to ask when confronted with these kinds of image-text relations is not ‘what is the difference (or similarity) between the words and the images?’ but ‘what difference do the differences (and similarities) make?’” (Mitchell 91)

“Viewed from either side, from the standpoint of the visual or the verbal, the medium of writing deconstructs the possibility of a pure image or pure text” (Mitchell 95)

disjunction of speaking/seeing in film, requiring seamless image/text suturing


II. TEXTUAL PICTURES

FOUR: VISIBLE LANGUAGE: BLAKE’S ART OF WRITING

“Both of these procedures — the ‘linguistics of the image’ and the ‘iconology of the text’ — involve a metaphorical treatment of one of the terms in the phrase ‘visible language.’” (Mitchell 112)

Derrida and grammatology

Romanticism and the Politics of Writing

The Scribal Scene: Book and Scroll

Human Letters

FIVE: EKPHRASIS AND THE OTHER

Radio Photographs: Ekphrastic Poetics

ekphrasis: the verbal representation of visual representation

ekphrastic fear: “the utopian figures of the image and its textual rendering as transparent windows onto reality are supplanted by the notion of the image as a deceitful illusion” (Mitchell 156)

Cups and Shields: Ekphrastic Poetry

“Medusa is the perfect prototype for the image as a dangerous female other who threatens to silence the poet’s voice and fixate his observing eye.” (Mitchell 172)

SIX: NARRATIVE, MEMORY, AND SLAVERY

“What would it mean for the ekphrastic ‘object’ to speak of and for itself in a former time, from the standpoint of a present in which it is no longer an object, but has become a subject? The answer, I will argue, is to be found in the nexus of narrative, memory, and slavery.” (Mitchell 185)

description and memory as “servant functions”

“In his analysis of the fetish-character of commodities, Marx imagines what it would be like if the commodity could speak. The deepest answer, I suggest, is contained in the nexus of narrative, memory, and slavery.” (Mitchell 196)

visuality of memory in Beloved


III. PICTORIAL TEXTS

SEVEN: UT PICTURA THEORIA: ABSTRACT PAINTING AND LANGUAGE

obsolescence of abstract art; part of the modernist moment

hostility of abstract art to literature/narrative; project of abstract art as the construction of a wall between the arts of vision and the arts of language

“If we summarize the traditional collaboration of painting and literature under the classic Horatian maxim, ut pictura poesis, as in painting, so in poetry, then the maxim for abstract art is not hard to predict: ut pictura theoria.  Or, as [Tom] Wolfe expresses it: ‘these days, without a theory to go with it, I can’t see a painting.’” (Mitchell 220)

EIGHT: WORD, IMAGE, AND OBJECT: WALL LABELS FOR ROBERT MORRIS

Robert Morris and “High Postmodernism”

NINE: THE PHOTOGRAPHIC ESSAY: FOUR CASE STUDIES

Photography and Language

The Photographic Essay

Spy and Counter-spy: “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men”

Labyrinth and Thread: “Camera Lucida”

Voyeurism and Exorcism: “The Colonial Harem”

Exile and Return: “After the Last Sky”


IV. PICTURES AND POWER

pictures of power/power of pictures; illusionism v. realism; spectacle v. surveillance

“Spectacle is the ideological form of pictorial power; surveillance is its bureaucratic, managerial, and disciplinary form.” (Mitchell 327)

one way of describing the pictorial turn: convergence of spectacle and surveillance in visual culture

TEN: ILLUSION: LOOKING AT ANIMALS LOOKING

Illusion: An Illustration

Looking at Animals Looking

illusionism hinges on power to produce error in others; relations of power and domination

illusion v. illusionism; illusionism = “the self-conscious exploitation of illusion as a cultural practice for social ends” (Mitchell 343)

“How can we intervene critically, therapeutically in what is widely perceived as the contemporary epidemic of illusion, the virtual collapse of all distinctions between the aesthetic and the nonaesthetic, the play of what Baudrillard has called ‘simulacra,’ which undermine all distinction between illusion and illusionism?” (Mitchell 343)

ELEVEN: REALISM, IRREALISM, AND IDEOLOGY: AFTER NELSON GOODMAN

“Realism is thus representation plus a belief system, and the beliefs may refer either to the representational mode or to what it represents.” (Mitchell 356)

“Truth, certainty, and knowledge are structurally connoted in realistic representation: they constitute the ideology or automatism necessary for it to construct a reality.  That is why realism is such an apt vehicle for spreading lies, confusion, and disinformation, for wielding power over mass publics, or for projecting fantasy.” (Mitchell 357)

“We now live in a time of hyperrealism, in which the technical mastery of illusion and realism is so complete that it offers itself as an aesthetic object in its own right or puts itself at the service of totalizing fantasies.” (Mitchell 358)


V. PICTURES AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE

public sphere as place outside power

“What is the relation between power and publicity in the actual world of triumphant capitalism and international corporate culture?  What is the role of art and imagemaking in a public sphere that is mainly constituted by forms of mass spectacle and the mediatization of experience — the world as theme park?  What is the relation between spectacle and surveillance in a ‘New World Order’ of televisual war and public melodrama?” (Mitchell 365)

end of postmodernism in late 1980s?; the new transparency of the media; foregrounding of mediation

“total television” (Mitchell 368)

TWELVE: THE VIOLENCE OF PUBLIC ART: DO THE RIGHT THING

public art/film; violence in public art

Do the Right Thing as public art

THIRTEEN: FROM CNN TO JFK

JFK as movie about television news; CNN’s coverage of Gulf War as war movie


CONCLUSION: SOME PICTURES OF REPRESENTATION

end of postmodernism = era of “pictorial turn”

metapicture: “to make visible the impossibility of separating theory from practice . . . to reveal theory as representation” (Mitchell 418)

imagetext: “to reveal the inescapable heterogeneity of representation” (Mitchell 418)

Outside Representation: Some Wrinkles

The Exile of Representation

Representation and Responsibility
