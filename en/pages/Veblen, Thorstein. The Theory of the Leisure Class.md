Veblen, Thorstein.  The Theory of the Leisure Class.  1899.  New York: Penguin, 1994.


CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTORY

institution of leisure class at highest phase of development in barbarian culture

primary distinction between classes is distinction in proper employments

chief honorable employments:  warfare, priestly service

upper classes exempt from industry; this exemption is economic expression of superior rank

non-industrial occupations: government, warfare, religious observances, sports

manual labor, industry, everyday work of getting a livelihood exclusive to “inferior” class

“Virtually the whole range of industrial employments is an outgrowth of what is classed as woman’s work in the primitive barbarian community.” (Veblen 5)

profound sense of difference between men’s and women’s work

“the institution of a leisure class has emerged gradually during the transition from primitive savagery to barbarism; or more precisely, during the transition from a peaceable to a consistently warlike habit of life.” (Veblen 7)

two conditions: 1. the community must be of a predatory habit of life; 2. subsistence must be easily obtainable (so that a significant portion of the population can be exempted from work)

distinction between worthy and non-worthy employments:  exploit

“Such employments as warfare, politics, public worship, and public merrymaking, are felt, in the popular apprehension, to differ intrinsically from the labour that has to do with elaborating the material means of life.” (Veblen 10) — public merrymaking = emtertainment? the entertainment industry as non-industrial occupation of the leisure class? (popular perception of the “work” of making a movie)

industrial effort = utilization of non-human things; utilization of  other people ≠ industrial work

physiological and temperamental differences between the sexes widened due to assigned roles

dignity, honor, worth; worth demonstrated through trophies — things seized by force

“Predation cannot become the habitual, conventional resource of any group or any class until industrial methods have been developed to such as degree of efficiency as to leave a margin worth fighting for, above the subsistence of those engaged in getting a living.” (Veblen 20)

CHAPTER II: PECUNIARY EMULATION

“the emergence of a leisure class coincides with the beginning of ownership.” (Veblen 22) — result from same set of economic forces

ownership = a conventional right or equitable claim to extraneous things

earliest form of ownership: ownership of woman by man (trophies from raids)

the end of acquisition and accumulation of goods is held to be their consumption (whether by owner or by owner’s household); but this can only proceed from a naive meaning of “consumption”

real motive of ownership:  *emulation* — “The possession of wealth confers honor; it is an invidious distinction.” (Veblen 26)

property initial conferred honor on owner over “other” from whom it was seized; later, it came to confer honor on owner over members of his own group

“With the growth of settled industry, therefore, the possession of wealth gains in relative importance and effectiveness as a customary basis of repute and esteen.” (Veblen 28)

wealth as most easily recognized evidence of honor; therefore, wealth becomes conventional basis of esteem; “Wealth is now instrinsically honorable and confers honor on its possessor.” (Veblen 29) — Weber?

“So soon as the possession of property becomes the basis of popular esteem, therefore, it becomes also a requisite to that complacency which we call self-respect.” (Veblen 31)

each gain in wealth brings increased desire for more

“The propensity for achievement and the repugnance to futility remain the underlying economic motive.” (Veblen 33) — propensity for achievement shifts into propensity for pecuniary achievement

“Purposeful effort comes to mean, primarily, effort directed to or resulting in a more creditable showing of accumulated wealth.” (Veblen 34)

CHAPTER III: CONSPICUOUS LEISURE

in absence of secondary demands, drive for honor through wealth would lead to increased diligence

however, most crucial secondary demand of emulation is requirement of exempt from productive work

“It is felt by all persons of refined taste that a spiritual contamination is inseparable from certain offices that are conventionally required of servants.” (Veblen 37)

leisure becomese prerequisite for blameless or “beautiful” life

“Conspicuous abstention from labour therefore becomes the conventional mark of superior pecuniary achievement and the conventional index of reputability” (Veblen 38)

leisure class begins its life in predatory culture, but becomes truly a leisure class in next stage

“According to well-established laws of human nature, prescription seizes upon this conventional evidence of wealth and fixes it in men’s habits of thought as something that is in itself substantially meritorious and ennobling” (Veblen 41)

“the term ‘leisure,’ as here used, does not connote indolence or quiescence.  What it connotes is non-productive consumption of time.” (Veblen 43)

conspicuousness of conspicuous leisure: evidence in “immaterial” goods (quasi-scholarly and quasi-artistic accomplishments), physical habit and dexterity (manners, decorum — most important)

refined tastes and good breeding as useful evidence of gentility, leisure — leads to snobbery

ownership of persons: part of incentive is their utility; some servants become exempted from industrial occupations and are assigned to attendance on the master; progressive exemption of servants from productive labor eventually leads to only nominal duties — conspicious vicarious leisure of servants accrues even more honor to master (vicarious leisure of housewife)

“a subsidiary or derivative leisure class, whose office is the performance of a vicarious leisure for the behoof of the reputability of the primary or legitimate leisure class.” (Veblen 59)

“The leisure of the servant is not his own leisure.” (Veblen 60)

“the chief use of servants is the evidence they afford of the master’s ability to pay.” (Veblen 62)

quasi-peaceable stage following predatory stage = stage of status (barbarians, part 2)

CHAPTER IV: CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION

vicarious consumption of goods by servants:  liveries and uniforms; servants’ quarters; food, dwelling, etc. of domestic establishment

“Unproductive consumption of goods is honourable, primarily as a mark of prowess and a perquisite of human dignity; secondarily it becames substantially honourable in itself” (Veblen 69)

women/servants should consume only for the benefit of their masters, not for their own benefit

consumption of top-quality goods is honorific; failure to consume is a demerit

the giving of valuable presents and expensive feasts and entertainments

as we travel lower on social scale, duties of vicarious consumption and leisure fall on wife alone, such as in American lower-middle class; but in lower middle class, no pretense of leisure on part of husband

“the wife, who was at the outset the drudge and chattel of the man, both in fact and in theory, — the producer of goods for him to consume, — has become the ceremonial consumer of goods which he produces.  But she still quite unmistakable remains his chattel in theory; for the habitual rendering of vicarious leisure and consumption is the abiding mark of the unfree servant.” (Veblen 83)

“No class of society, not even the most abjectly poor, foregoes all customary conspicuous consumption.” (Veblen 85)

utility of conspicuous leisure and consumption for purposes of reputability lies in element of waste

when social group is small,  either method equally effective; when society becomes larger and more differentiated, consumption becomes more effective than leisure

instinct of workmanship — in later industrial era, element of purposeful employment creeps into conspicuous leisure

we often make comparisons among things on an intellectual or aesthetic basis when the only substantive difference is actually pecuniary

waste: “In strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison.” (Veblen 99)

CHAPTER V: THE PECUNIARY STANDARD OF LIVING

desire to live up to the conventional standard of living in consumption — but this standard is infinitely extensible, and very difficult to retract

“the conspicuously wasteful honorific expenditure that confers spiritual well-being may become more indispensable than much of that expenditure which ministers to the ‘lower’ wants of physical well-being or sustenance only.” (Veblen 103)

standard which guides us is ideal which lies just out of reach; emulation of class immediately above

via emulation, all standards can be traced back to leisure class (think @ Hollywood and emulation)

control of accepted standard of living is chiefly negative — prevents regression

“The standard of living of any class, so far as concerns the element of conspicuous waste, is commonly as high as the earning capacity of the class will permit — with a constant tendency to go higher. The effect upon the serious activities of men is therefore to direct them with great singleness of purpose to the largest possible acquisition of wealth, and to discountenance work that brings no pecuniary gain.” (Veblen 112)

visible consumption

CHAPTER VI: PECUNIARY CANONS OF TASTE

conspicuous waste as motive does not exist in bald, unsophisticated form; instead, appears as wish to conform, to live up to standards of decency

canons of pecuniary decency affect aesthetic judgments: taste

sacredness of property as psychological precipitate of meritoriousness of wealth

devout consumption (sacred edifices, vestments, etc.); canons of pecuniary reputability affect our notions of the attributes of divinity

sense of beauty: superior gratification derived from consumption of more expensive goods

rarity of gems derives from beauty, or other way around?

blending of characteristics of expensiveness and beauty

articles of dress, household furnishings — fashion

preference for topiary and flowerbeds in gardens evidence of desire of middle-class for dominance over nature; dominance of pecuniary beauty over aesthetic beauty in middle-class tastes

animals:  preferences for useless beauty — dogs, racehorses

elements of feminine beauty — connected to society’s economic valuation of women; pathological female beauty (corsets, foot-binding) used to make women physically incapable of work, to demonstrate vicarious leisure

preference for handcrafting over machine crafting shows lack of concern for function

pecuniary canons of taste as negative rather than positive

CHAPTER VII: DRESS AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE PECUNIARY CULTURE

example of principles so far discussed

expenditures on clothes are to maintain a respectable appearance rather than to keep warm

dress as conspicuous leisure: clothes that demonstrate one is not engaged in productive labor

women’s dress goes further to show abstinence from productive employment

corset as mutilation, rendering woman permanently unfit for work

fashion and changing tastes

differences between women’s and men’s dress: men cannot appear incapacitated; woman becomes figure of vicarious conspicuous leisure

livery of servants; vestments of priests

CHAPTER VIII: INDUSTRIAL EXEMPTION AND CONSERVATISM

natural selection of institutions in evolution of social structure

“selective adaptation of habits of thought” (Veblen 189)

insitutions/habits of thought handed down from past; never quite fits present

“social inertia, psychological inertia, conservatism” (Veblen 191)

social structure only changes through change in habits of thought

redistribution of conditions of life coming from change not equable; some always hurt; these most willing to develop new habits of thought — change comes from economic pressures

progress is very slow and difficult; retrogression much easier (evidence of reversion in colonialism)

leisure class sheltered from economic exigencies; least responsive to demands for change

leisure class is conservative class; has vested interest in status quo

conservatism has come to be mark of respectability; innovation is vulgar

revulsion in the face of change = aversion to bother of readjustment

change requires surplus energy; progress hindered in lower classes by “underfeeding and excessive physical hardship” (Veblen 204) — poor are conservative because they cannot spare the energy

standards of conspicuous consumption strengthen conservative outlook by absorbing spare energy

conservatism of leisure class works counter to natural selection

effects of leisure class on economic institutions: pecuniary v. industrial institutions

“The relation of the leisure (that is, propertied non-industrial) class to the economic process is a pecuniary relation — a relation of acquisition, not of production; of exploitation, not of serviceability.” (Veblen 209)

CHAPTER IX: THE CONSERVATION OF ARCHAIC TRAITS

effect of leisure class on characters of individual members of society

main ethnic types: dolichocephalic blond; brachycephalic brunette; Mediterranean

variants: peaceable (ante-predatory), predatory; predatory as hereditary present

archaic traits which are survivals from peaceable phase: conscience, sense of truthfulness and equity, instinct of workmanship

barbarian (predatory) culture favors those who possess peaceable traits in a slight degree

peaceable characteristics produce weak, inefficient character? lack of invidiousness

predatory characteristics: ferocity, self-seeking, clannishness, disingenuousness

dolicho-blond owes success to possessing predatory characteristics in great degree

in industrially mature societies, interests of community no longer coincide with those of individual

community served by efficiency in productive employments; individual opposite

pecuniary employments v. industrial employments — differ in respect of aptitudes required for each: pecuniary employments act to conserve and cultivate predatory attitudes

pecuniary employments:  ownership, acquisition, accumulation, mercantile (captain of industry)

productive employments conducive to non-invidious, collective purposes

philanthropic impulse in leisure class; have leisure to revert to peaceable traits

pecuniary v. industrial = invidious (self-regarding) v. non-invidious (economical) traits

in theory, should be able to distinguish between temperaments of different classes — only holds true in the most general way; not conclusive — all classes share some degree of pecuniary traits

CHAPTER X: MODERN SURVIVALS OF PROWESS

“The leisure class lives by the industrial community rather than in it.” (Veblen 246)

fighting propensity — martial spirit, patriotism in leisure class; warlike spirit obsolescent in lower

the duel as leisure class institution

boyhood fighting as recapitulating historical development of man (predatory to peaceable)?

manifestations of predatory temperament classed as “exploit”; see sports

predatory temperament = boyish; addiction to sports as mark of arrested development?

sports satisfy both need for futility and need for make-believe purpose

sports work toward cultivation of predatory traits

habit of carrying a walking stick as evidence of leisure, but also a weapon

apologetics for institutions of barbarian culture, including sports, wealth, status, etc.

two directions of prowess: force and fraud; both find expression in sports

CHAPTER XI: THE BELIEF IN LUCK

gambling propensity as part of barbarian temperament

belief in luck traceable to pre-predatory stage — one form of animism

belief in luck as sense of “fortuitious necessity in the sequence of phenomena” (Veblen 278)

two phases:  incipient animism; belief in a preternatural agency (later anthropomorphized)

industry requires apprehension of causal sequence; animism subverts causality

economic significance: 1. sign of other archaic tratis; 2. material consequences important both (a) as affecting consumption of goods and canons of taste and (b) in stiffening sense of status

“Closely bound up with this correlation of anthropomorphism and prowess is the fact that anthropomorphic cults act to conserve, if not to initiate, habits of mind favourable to a régime of status.” (Veblen 290) — devout observances and emulative processes as closely linked

CHAPTER XII: DEVOUT OBSERVANCES

animistic propensity of gambler same psychological element as expressed in anthropomorphic cults

belief in a preternatural or hyperphysical agency; inclination to make terms with agency (cajoling)

gamblers frequently devout; overt relationship between sporting temperament and devout

see:  Salvation Army; college athletics, YMCA

status relations which shape society visible in anth. cults; divinity as master; personal subservience

elements of barbarian temperament; congruity between devout attitude and predatory mindset

economics: devout consumption of goods = conspicuous waste; holidays = conspicuous leisure

vicarious consumption/leisure of priestly class; proprieties of sacerdotal office

“a superhuman vicarious leisure class of saints, angels, etc. . . . an elaborate system of status” (Veblen 317)

conflict of devoutness and industrial temperament; declining devoutness in industrial classes; greater devoutness in those industrially exempt

“economic causes work towards a secularisation of men’s habits of thought” (Veblen 321)

lower classes particularly devout; artisan class falling away

middle-class congregation primarily women and children — (vicarious) leisure class

greater devoutness of South than North; lesser industrialization

reversion to spectacular observances of barbarian culture in northern leisure class

CHAPTER XIII: SURVIVALS OF THE NON-INVIDIOUS INTEREST

as devout attitude disintegrates, becomes blended with alien motives: charity, social good-fellowship, conviviality; the sense of human solidarity and sympathy — not connected to status

“non-invidious residue of the religious life” (Veblen 334)

in highest development of leisure class, members need not maintain predatory characteristics

if predatory outlet fails, must find expression in non-predatory acts

non-invidious advancement of industrial efficiency

charitable/social reform organizations — some participation is motivated by invidious interests, but some is non-invidious, revealing skepticism about legitimacy of emulative scheme of life (?)

ceremonial exclusion from productive effort of women and priests drafts their energies into non-invidious institutions — no other direction for impulse to purposeful action

cultural missions to poor; to inculcate upper-class cultural values (“the propaganda of culture” [Veblen 345])

in order to live pecuniarily blameless life, must not be familiar with elements of vulgar life; tends to set aside non-invidious motives in favor of more pecuniarily meritorious aims

the “woman question”: woman as ancillary to man; developing sense that this arrangement is wrong

“new woman” movement: emancipation and work

reversion to earlier, proto-anthropoid stage; inhibited by newer principle of invidious comparison

CHAPTER XIV: THE HIGHER LEARNING AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE PECUNIARY CULTURE

education formed to preserve certain habits of thought

influence of leisure-class ideals most patent in higher learning

early learning as acquisition of knowledge in service of deity; facility in subservience

priestly class began learning about natural processes to use as “evidence” of influence with deity

distinction between esoteric (non-industrial) and exoteric (industrial) knowledge; line between higher and lower learning

higher learning as leisure-class occupation; growth out of priestly class; rituals and vestments

tendency to replace priest with captain of industry as head of institutions of higher learning

instruction by men of pecuniary qualifications; transition from sacerdotal to pecuniary efficiency evidence of shift from conspicuous leisure to conspicuous consumption

education of women

“a prevalence of conservatism, if not of reactionary sentiment, especially among the higher schools where the conventional learning is cultivated” (Veblen 377)

affiliation of universities to religious denominations

college sports as expression of predatory impulse; fraternities as expression of clannish impulse

conservatism in work of universities as well

Mæcenas relation — scholar under patronage performs duties of a learned life vicariously for patron

reputable forms of erudition in classics and humanities, not practically applicable sciences

higher learning (scholasticism and classicism) as outgrowth of priestly (leisure) class; science as by-product of industrial process

elementary ed. and decline of emulation; kindergarten methods; non-invidious attitude

displacement of humanities in the university by “branches which make for civic and industrial efficiency” (Veblen 390)

“The classics, and their position of prerogative . . . serve to shape the intellectual attitude and lower the economic efficiency of the new learned generation.  They do this not only by holding up an archaic ideal of manhood, but also by the discrimination which they inculcate with respect to the reputable and disreputable in knowledge.  This result is accomplished in two ways: (1) by inspiring an habitual aversion to what is merely useful, as contrasted with what is merely honorific in learning . . . and (2) by consuming the learner’s time and effort in acquiring knowledge which is of no use” (Veblen 394)

purity/archaism of language used in educated writing/speech
