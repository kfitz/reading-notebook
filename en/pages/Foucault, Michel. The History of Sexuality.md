Part One: We "Other Victorians"

"For a long time, the story goes, we supported a Victorian regime, and we continue to be dominated by it even today." (Foucault 3)

"But twilight soon fell upon this bright day, followed by the monotonous nights of the Victorian bourgeoisie.  Sexuality was carefully confined; it moved into the home.  The conjugal family took custody of it and absorbed it into the serious function of reproduction." (Foucault 3) -- but this remains part of "the story," rather than an actual accounting of what happened?

"Nothing that was not ordered in terms of generation or transfigured by it could expect sanction or protection.  Nor did it merit a hearing." (Foucault 4)

"These are the characteristic features attributed to repression, which serve to distinguish it from the prohibitions maintained by penal law: repression operated as a sentence to disappear, but also as an injunction to silence, an affirmation of nonexistence, and, by implication, an admission that there was nothing to say about such things, nothing to see, and nothing to know." (Foucault 4)

"If it was truly necessary to make room for illegitimate sexualities, it was reasoned, let them take their infernal mischief elsewhere: to a place where they could be reintegrated, if not in the circuits of production, at least in those of profit.  The brothel and the mental hospital would be those places of tolerance: the prostitute, the client, and the pimp, together with the psychiatrist and his hysteric -- those 'other Victorians,' as Steven Marcus would say -- seem to have surreptitiously transferred the pleasures that are unspoken into the order of things that are counted." (Foucault 4)

"But have we not liberated ourselves from those two long centuries in which the history of sexuality must be seen first of all as the chronicle of an increasing repression?  Only to a slight extent, we are told." (Foucault 5)

"We are informed that if repression has indeed been the fundamental link between power, knowledge, and sexuality since the classical age, it stands to reason that we will not be able to free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost: nothing less than a transgression of laws, a lifting of prohibitions, an irruption of speech, a reinstating of pleasure within reality, and a whole new economy in the mechanisms of power will be required." (Foucault 5)

"By placing the advent of the age of repression in the seventeenth century, after hundreds of years of open spaces and free expression, one adjusts it to coincide with the development of capitalism: it becomes an integral part of the bourgeois order." (Foucault 5)

"A principle of explanation emerges after the fact:  if sex is so rigorously repressed, this is because it is incompatible with a general and intensive work imperative." (Foucault 5-6)

"Sex and its effects are perhaps not so easily deciphered; on the other hand, their repression, thus reconstructed, is easily analyzed." (Foucault 6)

"A suspicious mind might wonder if taking so many precautions in order to give the history of sex such an impressive filiation does not bear traces of the same old prudishness: as if those valorizing correlations were necessary before such a discourse could be formulated or accepted. // But there may be another reason that makes it so gratifying for us to define the relationship between sex and power in terms of repression: something that one might call the speaker's benefit.  If sex is repressed, that is, condemned to prohibition, nonexistence, and silence, then the mere fact that one is speaking about it has the appearance of a deliberate transgression." (Foucault 6)

"we are conscious of defying established power, our tone of voice shows that we know we are being subversive, and we ardently conjure away the present and appeal to the future, whose day will be hastened by the contribution we believe we are making." (Foucault 6-7)

"What sustains our eagerness to speak of sex in terms of repression is doubtless this opportunity to speak out against the powers that be, to utter truths and promise bliss, to link together enlightenment, liberation, and manifold pleasures; to pronounce a discourse that combines the fervor of knowledge, the determination to change the laws, and the longing for the garden of earthly delights." (Foucault 7)

"Ours is, after all, the only civilization in which officials are paid to listen to all and sundry impart the secrets of their sex" (Foucault 7)

"But it appears to me that the essential thing is not this economic factor, but rather the existence in our era of a discourse in which sex, the revelation of truth, the overturning of global laws, the proclamation of a new day to come, and the promise of a certain felicity are linked together.  Today it is sex that serves as a support for the ancient form -- so familiar and important in the West -- of preaching.  A great sexual sermon -- which has had its subtle theologians and its popular voices -- has swept through our societies over the last decades; it has chastised the old order, denounced hypocrisy, and praised the rights of the immediate and the real; it has made the people dream of a New City.  The Franciscans are called to mind.  And we might wonder how it is possible that the lyricism and religiosity that long accompanied the revolutionary project have, in Western industrial societies, been largely carried over to sex." (Foucault 7-8)

"The affirmation of a sexuality that has never been more rigorously subjugated than during the age of the hypocritical, bustling, and responsible bourgeoisie is coupled with the grandiloquence of a discourse purporting to reveal the truth about sex, modify its economy within reality, subvert the law that governs it, and change its future." (Foucault 8)

"my aim is to examine the case of a society which has been loudly castigating itself for its hypocrisy for more than a century, which speaks verbosely of its own silence, takes great pains to relate in detail the things it does not say, denounces the powers it exercises, and promises to liberate itself from the very laws that have made it function.  I would like to explore not only these discourses but also the will that sustains them and the strategic intention that supports them.  The question I would like to pose is not, Why are we repressed? but rather, Why do we say, with so much passion and so much resentment against our most recent past, against our present, and against ourselves, that we are repressed?  By what spiral did we come to affirm that sex is negated?  What led us to show, ostentatiously, that sex is something we hide, to say it is something we silence?" (Foucault 8-9)

"we must also ask why we burden ourselves today with so much guilt for having once made sex a sin." (Foucault 9)

"One can raise three serious doubts concerning what I shall term the 'repressive hypothesis.'  First doubt:  Is sexual repression truly an established historical fact?  Is what first comes into view -- and consequently permits one to advance an initial hypothesis -- really the accentuation or even the establishment of a regime of sexual repression beginning in the seventeenth century?  This is a properly historical question.  Second doubt:  Do the workings of power, and in particular those mechanisms that are brought into play in societies such as ours, really belong primarily to the category of repression?  Are prohibition, censorship, and denial truly the forms through which power is exercised in a general way, if not in every society, most certainly in our own?  This is a historico-theoretical question.  A third and final doubt:  Did the critical discourse that addresses itself to repression come to act as a roadblock to a power mechanism that had operated unchallenged up to that point, or is it not in fact part of the same historical network as the thing it denounces (and doubtless misrepresents) by calling it 'repression'?  Was there really a historical rupture between the age of repression and the critical analysis of repression?  This is a historico-political question." (Foucault 10)

"The doubts I would like to oppose to the repressive hypothesis are aimed less at showing it to be mistaken than at putting it back within a general economy of discourses on sex in modern societies since the seventeenth century.  Why has sexuality been so widely discussed, and what has been said about it?  What were the effects of power generated by what was said?  What are the links between these discourses, these effects of power, and the pleasures that were invested by them?  What knowledge (*savoir*) was formed as a result of this linkage?  The object, in short, is to define the regime of power-knowledge-pleasure that sustains the discourse on human sexuality in our part of the world.  The central issue, then (at least in the first instance), is not to determine whether one says yes or no to sex, whether one formulates prohibitions or permissions, whether one asserts its importance or denies its effects, or whether one refines the words one uses to designate it, but to account for the fact that it is spoken about, to discover who does the speaking, the positions and viewpoints from which they speak, the institutions which prompt people to speak about it and which store and distribute the things that are said.  What is at issue, briefly, is the over-all 'discursive fact,' the way sex is 'put into discourse.'" (Foucault 11)

"finally, the essential aim will not be to determine whether these discursive productions and these effects of power lead one to formulate the truth about sex, or on the contrary falsehoods designed to conceal that truth, but rather to bring out the 'will to knowledge' that serves as both their support and their instrument." (Foucault 11-12)

"I do not maintain that the prohibition of sex is a ruse; but it is a ruse to make prohibition into the basic and constitutive element from which one would be able to write the history of what has been said concerning sex starting from the modern epoch." (Foucault 12)

"A first survey made from this viewpoint seems to indicate that since the end of the sixteenth century, the 'putting into discourse of sex,' far from undergoing a process of restriction, one the contrary has bee subjected to a mechanism of increasing incitement; that the techniques of power exercised over sex have not obeyed a principle of rigorous selection, but rather one of dissemination and implantation of polymorphous sexualities; and that the will to knowledge has not come to a halt in the face of a taboo that must not be lifted, but has persisted in constituting -- despite many mistakes, of course -- a science of sexuality." (Foucault 12-13)


Part Two:  The Repressive Hypothesis

1.  The Incitement to Discourse

on the age of repression, begun in the seventeenth century: "Calling sex by its name thereafter became more difficult and more costly.  As if in order to gain mastery over it in reality, it had first been necessary to subjugate it at the level of language, control its free circulation in speech, expunge it form the things that were said, and extinguish the words that rendered it too visibly present." (Foucault 17)

"Yet, when one looks back over these last three centuries with their continual transformations, things appear in a very different light: around and apropos of sex, one sees a veritable discursive explosion.  We must be clear on this point, however.  It is quite possible that there was an expurgation -- and a very rigorous one -- of the authorized vocabulary.  It may indeed be true that a whole rhetoric of allusion and metaphor was codified.... At the level of discourses and their domains, however, practically the opposite phenomenon occurred.  There was a steady proliferation of discourses concerned with sex -- specific discourses, different from one another both by their form and by their object: a discursive ferment that gathered momentum from the eighteenth century onward." (Foucault 17-18)

"the multiplication of discourses concerning sex in the field of exercise of power itself" (Foucault 18)

"while the language may have been refined, the scope of the confession -- the confession of the flesh -- continually increased.  This was partly because the Counter Reformation busied itself with stepping up the rhythm of the yearly confession in the Catholic countries, and because it tried to impose meticulous rules of self-examination; but above all, because it attributed more and more importance in penance -- and perhaps at the expense of some other sins -- to all the insinuations of the flesh: thoughts, desires, voluptuous imaginings, delectations, combined movements of the body and the soul..." (Foucault 19)

"A twofold evolution tended to make the flesh into the root of all evil, shifting the most important moment of transgression from the act itself to the stirrings -- so difficult to perceive and formulate -- of desire." (Foucault 19-20)

"Under the authority of a language that had been carefully expurgated so that it was no longer directly named, sex was taken charge of, tracked down as it were, by a discourse that aimed to allow it no obscurity, no respite." (Foucault 20)

"An imperative was established: Not only will you confess to acts contravening the law, but you will seek to transform your desire, your every desire, into discourse." (Foucault 21)

"One could plot a line going straight from the seventeenth-century pastoral to what became its projection in literature, 'scandalous' literature at that." (Foucault 21)

"This is the essential thing: that Western man has been drawn for three centuries to the task of telling everything concerning his sex; that since the classical age there has been a constant optimization and an increasing valorization of the discourse on sex; and that this carefully analytical discourse was meant to yield multiple effects of displacement, intensification, reorientation, and modification of desire itself." (Foucault 23)

such displacement was "supported and relayed" by mechanisms including the "'public interest.'  Not a collective curiosity or sensibility; not a new mentality; but power mechanisms that functioned in such a way that discourse on sex -- for reasons that will have to be examined -- became essential." (Foucault 23)

"What is essential is not in all these scruples, in the 'moralism' they betray, or in the hypocrisy one can suspect them of, but in the recognized necessity of overcoming this hesitation.  One had to speak of sex; one had to speak publicly and in a manner that was not determined by the division between the licit and illicit, even if the speaker maintained the distinction for himself (which is what these solemn and preliminary declarations were intended to show): one had to speak of it as a thing not simply to be condemned or tolerated but managed, inserted into systems of utility, regulated for the greater good of all, made to function according to an optimum.  Sex was not something one simply judged; it was a thing one administered." (Foucault 24)

"A policing of sex: that is, not the rigor of a taboo, but the necessity of regulating sex through useful and public discourses." (Foucault 25)

"At the heart of this economic and political problem of population was sex: it was necessary to analyze the birthrate, the age of marriage, the legitimate and illegitimate births, the precocity and frequency of sexual relations, the ways of making them fertile or sterile, the effects of unmarried life or of the prohibitions, the impact of contraceptive practices -- of those notorious 'deadly secrets' which demographers on the eve of the Revolution knew were already familiar to the inhabitants of the countryside." (Foucault 25-26)

"this was the first time that a society had affirmed, in a constant way, that its future and its fortune were tied not only to the number and the uprightness of its citizens, to their marriage rules and family organization, but to the manner in which each individual made use of his sex." (Foucault 26)

"It was essential that the state know what was happening with its citizen's sex, and the use they made of it, but also that each individual be capable of controlling the use he made of it." (Foucault 26)

"Silence itself -- the things one declines to say, or is forbidden to name, the discretion that is required between different speakers -- it less the absolute limit of discourse, the other side from which it is separated by a strict boundary, than an element that functions alongside the things said, with them and in relation to them within overall strategies." (Foucault 27)

"There is not one but many silences, and they are an integral part of the strategies that underlie and permeate discourses." (Foucault 27)

on the schools:  "What one might call the internal discourse of the institution -- the one it employed to address itself, and which circulated among those who made it function -- was largely based on the assumption that this sexuality existed, that it was precocious, active and ever present.  But this was not all: the sex of the schoolboy became in the course of the eighteenth century -- and quite apart from that of adolescents in general -- a public problem." (Foucault 28)

evidence "together enables us to link an intensification of the interventions of power to a multiplication of discourse." (Foucault 30)

"many other centers which in the eighteenth or nineteenth century began to produce discourses on sex" (Foucault 30) -- medicine, psychiatry, criminal justice, other social controls

"These sites radiated discourses aimed at sex, intensifying people's awareness of it as a constant danger, and this in turn created a further incentive to talk about it." (Foucault 31)

"What is the significant thing about this story?  The pettiness of it all; the fact that this everyday occurrence in the life of village sexuality, these inconsequential bucolic pleasures, could become, from a certain time, the object not only of a collective intolerance but of a judicial action, a medical intervention, a careful clinical examination, and an entire theoretical elaboration." (Foucault 31)

"Whether in the form of a subtle confession in confidence or an authoritarian interrogation, sex -- be it refined or rustic -- had to be put into words." (Foucault 32)

"these discourses on sex did not multiply apart from or against power, but in the very space and as the means of its exercise." (Foucault 32)

"Sex was driven out of hiding and constrained to lead a discursive existence." (Foucault 33)

"It may well be that we talk about sex more than anything else; we set our minds to the task; we convince ourselves that we have never said enough on the subject" (Foucault 33)

"we are dealing less with *a* discourse on sex than with a multiplicity of discourses produced by a whole series of mechanisms operating in different institutions." (Foucault 33)

"it is not simply in terms of a continual extension that we must speak of this discursive growth; it should be seen rather as a dispersion of centers from which discourses emanated, a diversification of their forms, and the complex deployment of the network connecting them.  Rather than the uniform concern to hide sex, rather than a general prudishness of language, what distinguishes these last three centuries is the variety, the wide dispersion of devices that were invented for speaking about it... Rather than a massive censorship, beginning with the verbal proprieties imposed by the Age of Reason, what was involved was a regulated and polymorphous incitement to discourse." (Foucault 34)

"this often-stated theme, that sex is outside of discourse and that only the removing of an obstacle, the breaking of a secret, can clear the way leading to it, is precisely what needs to be examined.  Does it not partake of the injunction by which discourse is provoked?  Is it not with the aim of inciting people to speak of sex that it is made to mirror, at the outer limit of every actual discourse, something akin to a secret whose discovery is imperative, a thing abusively reduced to silence, and at the same time difficult and necessary, dangerous and precious to divulge?" (Foucault 34-35)

"What is peculiar to modern societies, in fact, is not that they consigned sex to a shadow existence, but that they dedicated themselves to speaking of it *ad infinitum*, while exploiting it as *the* secret." (Foucault 35)


2.  The Perverse Implantation

"A possible objection: it would be a mistake to see in this proliferation of discourses merely a quantitative phenomenon, something like a pure increase, as if what was said in them were immaterial, as if the fact of speaking about sex were of itself more important than the forms of imperatives that were imposed on it by speaking about it.  For was this transformation of sex into discourse not governed by the endeavor to expel from reality the forms of sexuality that were not amenable to the strict economy of reproduction: to say no to unproductive activities, to banish casual pleasures, to reduce or exclude practices whose object was not procreation?" (Foucault 36)

"All this garrulous attention which has us in a stew over sexuality, is it not motivated by one basic concern: to ensure population, to reproduce labor capacity, to perpetuate the form of social relations: in short, to constitute a sexuality that is economically useful and politically conservative? // I still do not know whether this is the ultimate objective.  But this much is certain: reduction has not been the means employed for trying to achieve it.  The nineteenth century and our own have been rather the age of multiplication: a dispersion of sexualities, a strengthening of their dispartate forms, a multiple implantation of 'perversions.'  Our epoch has initiated sexual heterogeneities." (Foucault 36-37)
 
prior to the end of the 18th century, "The sex of husband and wife was beset by rules and recommendations.  The marriage relation was the most intense focus of constraints... The 'rest' remained a good deal more confused: one only has to think of the uncertain status of 'sodomy,' or the indifference regarding the sexuality of children. // Moreover, these different codes did not make a clear distinction between violations of the rules of marriage and deviations with respect to genitality.  Breaking the rules of marriage or seeking strange pleasures brought an equal measure of condemnation." (Foucault 37-38)

"Doubtless acts 'contrary to nature' were stamped as especially abominable, but they were perceived simply as an extreme form of acts 'against the law'..." (Foucault 38)

"For a long time hermaphrodites were criminals, or crime's offspring, since their anatomical disposition, their very being, confounded the law that distinguished the sexes and prescribed their union." (Foucault 38)

two modification of this system, post-18th c:  "First, a centrifugal movement with respect to heterosexual monogamy.... The legitimate couple, with its regular sexuality, had a right to more discretion.... On the other hand, what came under scrutiny was the sexuality of children, mad men and women, and criminals; the sensuality of those who did not like the opposite sex; reveries, obsessions, petty manias, or great transports of rage." (Foucault 38-39)

"Whence the setting apart of the 'unnatural' as a specific dimension in the field of sexuality." (Foucault 39)

"There were two great systems conceived by the West for governing sex: the law of marriage and the order of desires -- and the life of Don Juan overturned them both." (Foucault 39-40)

"What does the appearance of all these peripheral sexualities signify?  Is the fact that they could appear in broad daylight a sign that the code had become more lax?  Or does the fact that they were given so much attention testify to a stricter regime and to its concern to bring them under close supervision?  In terms of repression, things are unclear.  There was permissiveness, if one bears in mind that the severity of the codes relating to sexual offenses diminished considerably in the nineteenth century and that law itself often deferred to medicine.  But an additional ruse of severity, if one thinks of all the agencies of control and all the mechanisms of surveillance that were put into operation by pedagogy or therapeutics." (Foucault 40-41)

"Perhaps the point to consider is not the level of indulgence or the quantity of repression but the form of power that was exercised.  When this whole thicket of disparate sexualities was labeled, as if to disentangle them from one another, was the object to exclude them from reality?  It appears, in fact, that the function of power exerted in this instance was not that of interdiction..." (Foucault 41)

"The child's 'vice' was not so much an enemy as a support; it may have been designated as the evil to be eliminated, but the extraordinary effort that went into the task that was bound to fail leads one to suspect that what was demanded of it was to persevere, to proliferate to the limits of the visible and the invisible, rather than to disappear for good.  Always relying on this support, power advanced, multiplied its relays and its effects, while its target expanded, subdivided, and branched out, penetrating further into reality at the same pace.  In appearance, we are dealing with a barrier system; but in fact, all around the child, indefinite *lines of penetration* were disposed." (Foucault 42)

"This new persecution of the peripheral sexualities entailed an *incorporation of perversions* and a new *specification of individuals*." (Foucault 42-43)

"The nineteenth-century homosexual became a personage, a past, a case history, and a childhood, in addition to being a type of life, a life form, and a morphology, with an indiscreet anatomy and possibly a mysterious physiology.  Nothing that went into his total composition was unaffected by his sexuality." (Foucault 43)

"We must not forget that the psychological, psychiatric, medical category of homosexuality was constituted from the moment it was characterized... less by a type of sexual relations than by a certain quality of sexual sensibility, a certain way of inverting the masculine and the feminine in oneself.  Homosexuality appeared as one of the forms of sexuality when it was transposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul.  The sodomite had been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species." (Foucault 43)

"The machinery of power that focused on this whole alien strain did not aim to suppress it, but rather to give it an analytical, visible, and permanent reality: it was implanted in bodies, slipped in beneath modes of conduct, made into a principle of classification and intelligibility, established as a *raison d'être* and a natural order of disorder.  Not the exclusion of these thousand aberrant sexualities, but the specification, the regional solidification of each one of them.  The strategy behind this dissemination was to strew reality with them and incorporate them into the individual." (Foucault 43-44)

"since sexuality was a medical and medicalizable object, one had to try and detect it -- as a lesion, a dysfunction, or a symptom -- in the depths of the organism, or on the surface of the skin, or among all the signs of behavior.  The power which thus took charge of sexuality set about contacting bodies, caressing them with its eyes, intensifying areas, electrifying surfaces, dramatizing troubled moments.  It wrapped the sexual body in its embrace.  There was undoubtedly an increase in effectiveness and an extension of the domain controlled; but also a sensualization of power and a gain of pleasure." (Foucault 44)

"Power operated as a mechanism of attraction; it drew out those peculiarities over which it kept watch.  Pleasure spread to the power that harried it; power anchored the pleasure it uncovered." (Foucault 45)

"The medical examination, the psychiatric investigation, the pedagogical report, and family controls may have the over-all and apparent objective of saying not to all wayward or unproductive sexualities, but the fact is that they function as mechanisms with a double impetus: pleasure and power.  The pleasure that comes of exercising a power that questions, monitors, watches, spies, searches out, palpates, brings to light; and on the other hand, the pleasure that kindles at having to evade this power, flee from it, fool it, or travesty it.  The power that lets itself be invaded by the pleasure it is pursuing; and opposite it, power asserting itself in the pleasure of showing off, scandalizing, or resisting." (Foucault 45)

"These attractions, these evasions, these circular incitements have traced around bodies and sexes, not boundaries not to be crossed, but *perpetual spirals of power and pleasure*." (Foucault 45)

"*devices of sexual saturation*" (Foucault 45)

"People often say that modern society has attempted to reduce sexuality to the couple -- the heterosexual and, insofar as possible, legitimate couple.  There are equal grounds for saying that it has, if not created, at least outfitted and made to proliferate, groups with multiple elements and a circulating sexuality" (Foucault 45)

"Nineteenth-century 'bourgeois' society... was a society of blatant and fragmented perversion." (Foucault 47)

"Not because, having tried to erect too rigid or too general a barrier against sexuality, society succeeded only in giving rise to a whole perverse outbreak and a long pathology of the sexual instinct.  At issue, rather, is the type of power it brought to bear on the body and on sex.  In point of fact, this power had neither the form of law, nor the effects of the taboo.  On the contrary, it acted by multiplication of singular sexualities.  It did not set boundaries for sexuality; it extended the various forms of sexualities, pursuing them according to lines of indefinite penetration.  It did not exclude sexuality, but included it in the body as a mode of specification of individuals.  It did not seek to avoid it; it attracated its varieties by means of spirals in which pleasure and power reinforced one another.  It did not set up a barrier; it provided places of maximum saturation.  It produced and determined the sexual mosaic.  Modern society is perverse, not in spite of its puritanism or as if from a backlash provoked by its hypocrisy; it is in actual fact, and directly, perverse." (Foucault 47)

"We must not imagine that all these things that were formerly tolerated attracted notice and received a pejorative designation when the time came to give a regulative role to the one type of sexuality that was capable of reproducing labor power and the form of the family.  These polymorphous conducts were actually extracted from people's bodies and from their pleasures; or rather, they were solidified in them; they were drawn out, revealed, isolated, intensified, incorporated, by multifarious power devices.  The growth of perversions is not a moralizing theme that obsessed the scrupulous minds of the Victorians.  It is the real product of the encroachment of a type of power on bodies and their pleasures." (Foucault 47-48)

"The implantation of perversions is an instrument-effect: it is through the isolation, intensification, and consolidation of peripheral sexualities that the relations of power to sex and pleasure branched out and multiplied, measured the body, and penetrated modes of conduct." (Foucault 48)

"We must therefore abandon the hypothesis that modern industrial societies ushered in an age of increased sexual repression.  We have not only witnessed a visible explosion of unorthodox sexualities; but -- and this is the important point -- a deployment quite different from the law, even if it is locally dependent on procedures of prohibition, has ensured, through a network of interconnecting mechanisms, the proliferation of specific pleasures and the multiplication of disparate sexualities." (Foucault 49)

"never have there existed more centers of power; never more attention manifested and verbalized; never more circular contacts and linkages; never more sites where the intensity of pleasures and the persistency of power catch hold, only to spread elsewhere." (Foucault 49)


Part Three: Scientia Sexualis

"the impression remains that all this has by and large played only a defensive role.  By speaking about it so much, by discovering it multiplied, partitioned off, and specified precisely where one had placed it, what one was seeking essentially was simply to conceal sex: a screen-discourse, a dispersion-avoidance.  Until Freud at least, the discourse on sex -- the discourse of scholars and theoreticians -- never ceased to hide the thing it was speaking about." (Foucault 53)

"This was in fact a science made up of evasions since, given its inability or refusal to speak of sex itself, it concerned itself primarily with aberrations, perversions, exceptional oddities, pathological abatements, and morbid aggravations." (Foucault 53)

"In the name of a biological and historical urgency, it justified the racisms of the state, which at the time were on the horizon.  It grounded them in 'truth'." (Foucault 54)

"Throughout the nineteenth century, sex seems to have been incorporated into two very distinct orders of knowledge: a biology of reproduction, which developed continuously according to a general scientific normativity, and a medicine of sex conforming to quite different rules of formation." (Foucault 54)

"It is as if a fundamental resistance blocked the development of a rationally formed discourse concerning human sex, its correlations, and its effects.  A disparity of this sort would indicate that the aim of such a discourse was not to state the truth but to prevent its very emergence.  Underlying the difference between the physiology of reproduction and the medical theories of sexuality, we would have to see something other and something more than an uneven scientific development or a disparity in the forms of rationality; the one would partake of that immense will to knowledge that has sustained the establishment of scientific discourse in the West, whereas the other would derive from a stubborn will to nonknowledge." (Foucault 55)

"the learned discourse on sex that was pronounced in the nineteenth century was imbued with age-old delusions, but also with systematic blindnesses: a refusal to see and to understand; but further -- and this is the crucial point -- a refusal concerning the very thing that was brought to light and whose formulation was urgently solicited." (Foucault 55)

on Charcot's research:  "The important thing, in this affair, is not that these men shut their eyes or stopped their ears, or that they were mistaken; it is rather that they constructed around and apropos of sex an immense apparatus for producing truth, even if this truth was to be masked at the last moment.  The essential point is that sex was not only a matter of sensation and pleasure, of law and taboo, but also of truth and falsehood, that the truth of sex became something fundamental, useful, or dangerous, precious or formidable: in short, that sex was constituted as a problem of truth." (Foucault 56)

"that 'interplay of truth and sex' which was bequeathed to us by the nineteenth century, and which we may have modified, but, lacking evidence to the contrary, have not rid ourselves of." (Foucault 57)

"Historically, there have been two great procedures for producing the truth of sex. // On the one hand, the societies -- and they are numerous: China, Japan, India, Rome, the Arabo-Moslem societies -- which endowed themselves with an *ars erotica*.  In the erotic art, truth is drawn from pleasure itself, understood as a practice and accumulated as experience; pleasure is not considered in relation to an absolute law of the permitted and the forbidden, nor by reference to a criterion of utility, but first and foremost in relation to itself; it is experienced as pleasure, evaluated in terms of its intensity, its specific quality, its duration, its reverberations in the body and the soul." (Foucault 57)

"In this way, there is formed a knowledge that must remain secret, not because of an element of infamy that might attach to its object, but because of the need to hold it in the greatest reserve, since, according to tradition, it would lose its effectiveness and its virtue by being divulged." (Foucault 57)

"On the face of it at least, our civilization possesses no *ars erotica*.  In return, it is undoubtedly the only civilization to practice a *scientia sexualis*; or rather, the only civilization to have developed over the centuries procedures for telling the truth of sex which are geared to a form of knowledge-power strictly opposed to the art of initiations and the masterful secret: I have in mind the confession." (Foucault 58)

"In any case, next to the testing rituals, next to the testimony of witnesses, and the learned methods of observation and demonstration, the confession became one of the West's most highly valued techniques for producing truth.  We have since become a singularly confessing society.  The confession has spread its effects far and wide.  It plays a part in justice, medicine, education, family relationships, and love relations, in the most ordinary affairs of everyday life, and in the most solemn rites; one confesses one's crimes, one's sins, one's thoughts and desires, one's illnesses and troubles; one goes about telling, with the greatest precision, whatever is most difficult to tell." (Foucault 59)

"Western man has become a confessing animal. // Whence a metamorphosis in literature: we have passed from a pleasure to be recounted and heard, centering on the heroic or marvelous narration of 'trials' of bravery or sainthood, to a literature ordered according to the infinite task of extracting from the depths of oneself, in between the words, a truth which the very form of the confession holds out like a shimmering image." (Foucault 59)

"The obligation to confess is now relayed through so many different points, is so deeply ingrained in us, that we no longer perceive it as the effect of a power that constrains us" (Foucault 60)

"Confession frees, but power reduces one to silence; truth does not belong to the order of power, but shares an original affinity with freedom" (Foucault 60)

"One has to be completely taken in by this internal ruse of confession in order to attribute a fundamental role to censorship, to taboos regarding speaking and thinking; one has to have an inverted image of power in order to believe that all these voices which have spoken so long in our civilization -- repeating the formidable injunction to tell what one is and what one does, what one recollects and what one has forgotten, what one is thinking and what one thinks he is not thinking -- are speaking to us of freedom." (Foucault 60)

"From the Christian penance to the present day, sex was a privileged theme of confession.  A thing that was hidden, we are told.  But what if, on the contrary, it was what, in a quite particular way, one confessed?  Suppose the obligation to conceal it was but another aspect of the duty to admit to it...?" (Foucault 61)

"The transformation of sex into discourse, which I spoke of earlier, the dissemination and reinforcement of heterogeneous sexualities, are perhaps two elements of the same deployment: they are linked together with the help of the central element of a confession that compels individuals to articulate their sexual peculiarity --  no matter how extreme.  In Greece, truth and sex were linked, in the form of pedagogy, by the transmission of a precious knowledge from one body to another; sex served as a medium for initiations into learning.  For us it is in the confession that truth and sex are joined, through the obligatory and exhaustive expression of an individual secret.  But this time it is truth that serves as a medium for sex and its manifestations." (Foucault 61)

confession as "a ritual that unfolds within a power relationship, for one does not confess without the presence (or virtual presence) of a partner who is not simply the interlocutor but the authority who requires the confession, prescribes and appreciates it, and intervenes in order to judge, punish, forgive, console and reconcile" (Foucault 61-62)

"For centuries, the truth of sex was, at least for the most part, caught up in this discursive form.  Moreover, this form was not the same as that of education (sexual education confined itself to general principles and rules of prudence); nor was it that of initiation (which remained essentially a silent practice, which the act of sexual enlightenment or deflowering rendered laughable or violent).  As we have seen, it is a form that is far removed from the one governing the 'erotic art.' By virtue of the power structure immanent in it, the confessional discourse cannot come from above, as in the *ars erotica*, through the sovereign will of a master, but rather from below, as an obligatory act of speech which, under some imperious compulsion, breaks the bonds of discretion or forgetfulness." (Foucault 62)

"the agency of domination does not reside in the one who speaks (for it is he who is constrained), but in the one who listens and says nothing; not in the one who knows and answers, but in the one who questions and is not supposed to know." (Foucault 62)

"the confession lends itself, if not to other domains, at least to new ways of exploring the existing ones.  It is no longer a question simply of saying what was done -- the sexual act -- and how it was done; but of reconstructing, in and around the act, the thoughts that recapitulated it, the obsessions that accompanied it, the images, desires, modulations, and quality of the pleasure that animated it.  For the first time no doubt, a society has taken upon itself to solicit and hear the imparting of individual pleasures." (Foucault 63)

"It is easy to make light of these nineteenth-century psychiatrists, who made a point of apologizing for the horrors they were about to let speak, evoking 'immoral behavior' or 'aberrations of the genetic sense,' but I am more inclined to applaud their seriousness: they had a feeling for momentous events.  It was a time when the most singular pleasures were called upon to pronounce a discourse of truth concerning themselves, a discourse which had to model itself after that which spoke, not of sin and salvation, but of bodies and life processes -- the discourse of science." (Foucault 64)

"can one articulate the production of truth according to the old juridico-religious model of confession, and the extortion of confidential evidence according to the rules of scientific discourse?" (Foucault 64)

"There was no deficiency, but rather an excess, a redoubling, too much rather than not enough discourse, in any case an interference between two modes of production of truth: procedures of confession, and scientific discursivity" (Foucault 64-65)

"the procedures by which that will to knowledge regarding sex, which characterizes the modern Occident, caused the rituals of confession to function within the norms of scientific regularity...
1.  Through a clinical codification of the inducement to speak...
2.  Through the postulate of a general and diffuse causality...
3.  Through the principle of a latency intrinsic to sexuality...
4.  Through the method of interpretation...
5.  Through the medicalization of the effects of confession..." (Foucault 65-67)

"the principle that endowed sex with an inexhaustible and polymorphous causal power... there was scarcely a malady or disturbance to which the nineteenth century did not impute at least some degree of sexual etiology." (Foucault 65)

"The limitless dangers that sex carried with it justified the exhaustive character of the inquisition to which it was subjected." (Foucault 66)

"the ways of sex were obscure; it was elusive by nature" (Foucault 66)

the confession "tended no longer to be concerned solely with what the subject wished to hide, but with what was hidden from himself" (Foucault 66)

"The truth did not reside solely in the subject who, by confessing, would reveal it fully formed.  It was constituted in two stages: present but incomplete, blind to itself, in the one who spoke, it could only reach completion in the one who assimilated and recorded it." (Foucault 66)

"The one who listened was not simply the forgiving master, the judge who condemned or acquitted; he was the master of truth.  His was a hermeneutic function.  With regard to the confession, his power was not only to demand it before it was made, or decide what was to follow after it, but also to constitute a discourse of truth on the basis of its decipherment." (Foucault 66-67)

"the sexual domain was no longer accounted for simply by the notions of error or sin, excess or transgression, but was placed under the rule of the normal and the pathological" (Foucault 67)

"In any case, nearly one hundred and fifty years have gone into the making of a complex machinery for producing true discourses on sex: a deployment that spans a wide segment of history in that it connects the ancient injunction of confession to clinical listening methods.  It is this deployment that enables something called 'sexuality' to embody the truth of sex and its pleasures. // 'Sexuality': the correlative of that slowly developed discursive practice which constitutes the *scientia sexualis*." (Foucault 68)

"Situated at the point of intersection of a technique of confession and a scientific discursivity, where certain major mechanisms had to be found for adapting them to one another (the listening technique, the postulate of causality, the principle of latency, the rule of interpretation, the imperative of medicalization), sexuality was defined as being 'by nature': a domain susceptible to pathological processes, and hence one calling for therapeutic or normalizing interventions; a field of meanings to decipher; the site of processes concealed by specific mechanisms; a focus of indefinite causal relations; and an obscure speech (*parole*) that had to be ferreted out and listened to.  The 'economy' of dicourses -- their intrinsic technology, the necessities of their operation, the tactics they employ, the effects of power which underlie them and which they transmit -- this, and not a system of representations, is what determines the essential features of what they have to say.  The history of sexuality -- that is, the history of what functioned in the nineteenth century as a specific field of truth -- must first be written from the viewpoint of a history of discourses." (Foucault 68-69)

"Let us put forward a general working hypothesis.  The society that emerged in the nineteenth century -- bourgeois, capitalist, or industrial society, call it what you will -- did not confront sex with a fundamental refusal of recognition.  On the contrary, it put into operation an entire machinery for producing true discourses concerning it.  Not only did it speak of sex and compel everyone to do so; it also set out to formulate the uniform truth of sex.  As if it suspected sex of harboring a fundamental secret.  As if it needed this production of truth.  As if it was essential that sex be inscribed not only in an economy of pleasure but in an ordered system of knowledge." (Foucault 69)

"in this 'question' of sex (in both senses: as interrogation and problematization, and as the need for confession and integration into a field of rationality), two processes emerge, the one always conditioning the other: we demand that sex speak the truth (but, since it is the secret and is oblivious to its own nature, we reserve for ourselves the function of telling the truth of its truth, revealed and deciphered at last), and we demand that it tell us our truth, or rather, the deeply buried truth of that truth about ourselves which we think we possess in our immediate consciousness." (Foucault 69)

"From this interplay there has evolved, over several centuries, a knowledge of the subject; a knowledge not so much of his form, but of that which divides him, determines him perhaps, but above all causes him to be ignorant of himself.  As unlikely as this may seem, it should not surprise us when we think of the long history of the Christian and juridical confession, of the shifts and transformations this form of knowledge-power, so important in the West, has undergone: the project of a science of the subject has gravitated, in ever narrowing circles, around the question of sex." (Foucault 70)

"the *ars erotica* did not disappear altogether from Western civilization... in the search for spiritual union and the love of God, there was a whole series of methods that had much in common with an erotic art: guidance by the master along a path of initiation, the intensification of experiences extending down to their physical components, the optimization of effects by the discourse that accompanied them." (Foucault 70)

"And we must ask whether, since the nineteenth century, the *scientia sexualis* -- under the guise of its decent positivism -- has not functioned, at least to a certain extent, as an *ars erotica*." (Foucault 70-71)

"We have at least invented a different kind of pleasure: pleasure in the truth of pleasure, the pleasure of knowing that truth, of discovering and exposing it, the fascination of seeing it and telling it, of captivating and capturing others by it, of confiding it in secret, of luring it out in the open -- the specific pleasure of the true discourse on pleasure." (Foucault 71)

"The most important elements of an erotic art linked to our knowledge about sexuality are not to be sought in the ideal, promised to us by medicine, of a healthy sexuality, nor in the humanist dream of a complete and flourishing sexuality, and certainly not in the lyricism of orgasm and the good feelings of bio-energy (these are but aspects of its normalizing utilization), but in this multiplication and intensification of pleasures connected to the production of the truth about sex." (Foucault 71)

"the formidable 'pleasure of analysis' (in the widest sense of the latter term) which the West has cleverly been fostering for several centuries: all this constitutes something like the errant fragments of an erotic art that is secretly transmitted by confession and the science of sex." (Foucault 71)

"In any case, the hypothesis of a power of repression exerted by our society on sex for economic reasons appears to me quite inadequate if we are to explain this whole series of reinforcements and intensifications that our preliminary inquiry has discovered: a proliferation of discourses, carefully tailored to the requirements of power; the solidification of the sexual mosaic and the construction of devices capable not only of isolating it but of stimulating and provoking it, of forming it into focuses of attention, discourse, and pleasure; the mandatory production of confessions and the subsequent establishment of a system of legitimate knowledge and of an economy of manifold pleasures.  We are dealing not nearly so much with a negative mechanism of exclusion as with the operation of a subtle network of discourses, special knowledges, pleasures, and powers.  At issue is not a movement bent on pushing rude sex back into some obscure and inaccessible region, but on the contrary, a process that spreads it over the surface of things and bodies, arouses it, draws it out and bids it speak, implants it in reality and enjoins it to tell the truth: an entire glittering sexual array, reflected in a myriad of discourses, the obstination of powers, and the interplay of knowledge and pleasure." (Foucault 72)

"We need to take these mechanisms seriously, therefore, and reverse the direction of our analysis: rather than assuming a generally acknowledged repression, and an ignorance measures against what we are supposed to know, we must begin with these positive mechanisms, insofar as they produce knowledge, multiply discourse, induce pleasure, and generate power; we must investigate the conditions of their emergence and operation, and try to discover how the related facts of interdiction or concealment are distributed with respect to them.  In short, we must define the strategies of power that are immanent in this will to knowledge.  As far as sexuality is concerned, we shall attempt to constitute the 'political economy' of a will to knowledge." (Foucault 73)


Part Four: The Deployment of Sexuality

"For many years, we have all been living in the realm of Prince Mangogul: under the spell of an immense curiosity about sex, bent on questioning it, with an insatiable desire to hear it speak and be spoken about, quick to invent all sorts of magical rings that might force it to abandon its discretion." (Foucault 77)

"Between each of us and our sex, the West has placed a never-ending demand for truth: it is up to us to extract the truth of sex, since this truth is beyond its grasp; it is up to sex to tell us our truth, since sex is what holds it in darkness." (Foucault 77)

"In the space of a few centuries, a certain inclination has led us to direct the question of what we are, to sex.  Not so much to sex as representing nature, but to sex as history, as signification and discourse.  We have placed ourselves under the sign of sex, but in the form of a *Logic of Sex*, rather than a *Physics*." (Foucault 78)

"the West has managed not only, or not so much, to annex sex to a field of rationality, which would not be all that remarkable an achievement, seeing how accustomed we are to such 'conquests' since the Greeks, but to bring us almost entirely -- our bodies, our minds, our individuality, our history -- under the sway of a logic of concupiscence and desire." (Foucault 78)

"It is reasonable therefore to ask first of all:  What is this injunction?  Why this great chase after the truth of sex, the truth in sex?" (Foucault 79)

"What is it that we demand of sex, beyond its possible pleasures, that makes us so persistent?  What is this patience or eagerness to constitute it as the secret, the omnipotent cause, the hidden meaning, the unremitting fear?  And why was the task of discovering this difficult truth finally turned into an invitation to eliminate taboos and break free of what binds us?" (Foucault 79)


1.  Objective

"I have repeatedly stressed that the history of the last centuries in Western societies did not manifest the movement of a power that was essentially repressive.  I based my argument on the disqualification of that notion while feigning ignorance of the fact that a critique has been mounted from another quarter and doubtless in a more radical fashion: a critique conducted at the level of the theory of desire.  In point of fact, the assertion that sex is not 'repressed' is not altogether new.  Psychoanalysts have been saying the same thing for some time.  They have challenged the simple little machinery that comes to mind when one speaks of repression; the idea of a rebellious energy that must be throttled has appeared to them inadequate for deciphering the manner in which power and desire are joined to one another; they consider them to be linked in a more complex and primary way than through the interplay of a primitive, natural, and living energy welling up from below, and a higher order seeking to stand in its way; thus one should not think that desire is repressed, for the simple reason that the law is what constitutes both desire and the lack on which it is predicated." (Foucault 81)

"The aim of the inquiries that will follow is to move less toward a 'theory' of power than toward an 'analytics' of power: that is, toward a definition of the specific domain formed by relations of power, and toward a determination of the instruments that will make possible its analysis." (Foucault 82)

"In other words, what distinguishes the analysis made in terms of the repression of instincts from that made in terms of the law of desire is clearly the way in which they each conceive of the nature and dynamics of the drives, not the way in which they conceive of power.  They both rely on a common representation of power which, depending on the use made of it and the position it is accorded with respect to desire, leads to two contrary results: either to the promise of a 'liberation,' if power is seen as having only an external hold on desire, or, if it is constitutive of desire itself, to the affirmation: you are always-already trapped." (Foucault 82-83)

some of the principal features of the representation of power: the negative relation; the insistence of the rule; the cycle of prohibition; the logic of censorship; the uniformity of the apparatus

the negative relation:  "Where sex and pleasure are concerned, power can 'do' nothing but say no to them; what it produces, if anything, is absences and gaps." (Foucault 83)

the insistence of the rule:  "sex is placed by power in a binary system: licit and illicit, permitted and forbidden... sex is to be deciphered on the basis of its relation to the law... power's hold on sex is maintained through language" (Foucault 83)

the cycle of prohibition: "To deal with sex, power employs nothing more than a law of prohibition.... Power constrains sex only through a taboo that plays on the alternative between two nonexistences." (Foucault 84)

the logic of censorship: "three forms: affirming that such a thing is not permitted, preventing it from being said, denying that it exists" (Foucault 84)

the uniformity of the apparatus:  "from state to family, from prince to father, from the tribunal to the small change of everyday punishments, from the agencies of social domination to the structures that constitute the subject himself, one finds a general form of power, varying in scale alone.  This form is the law of transgression and punishment, with its interplay of licit and illicit.  Whether one attributes it to the form of the prince who formulates rights, of the father who forbids, of the censor who enforces silence, or of the master who states the law, in any case one schematizes power in a juridical form, and one defines its effects as obedience.  Confronted by a power that is law, the subject who is constituted as subject -- who is 'subjected' -- is he who obeys." (Foucault 84-85)

on the effectiveness of the usual mode of representing power:  "This is the paradox of its effectiveness: it is incapable of doing anything, except to render what it dominates incapable of doing anything either, except for what this power allows it to do." (Foucault 85)

on the effectiveness of the usual mode of representing power:  "All the modes of domination, submission, and subjugation are ultimately reduced to an effect of obedience." (Foucault 85)

"Why is this juridical notion of power, involving as it does the neglect of everything that makes for its productive effectiveness, its strategic resourcefulness, its positivity, so readily accepted?... Why are the deployments of power reduced simply to the procedure of the law of interdiction?" (Foucault 86)

"power is tolerable only on condition that it mask a substantial part of itself.  Its success is proportional to its ability to hide its own mechanisms.  Would power be accepted if it were entirely cynical?  For it, secrecy is not in the nature of an abuse; it is indispensable to its operation.  Not only because power imposes secrecy on those whom it dominates, but because it is perhaps just as indispensable to the latter: would they accept it if they did not see it as a mere limit placed on their desire, leaving a measure of freedom -- however slight -- intact?" (Foucault 86)

"If these institutions were able to implant themselves, if, by profiting from a whole series of tactical alliances, they were able to gain acceptance, this was because they presented themselves as agencies of regulation, arbitration, and demarcation, as a way of introducing order in the midst of these powers, of establishing a principle that would temper them and distribute them according to boundaries and a fixed hierarchy." (Foucault 86-87)

"The slogan of this regime, *pax et justitia*, in keeping with the function it laid claim to, established peace as the prohibition of feudal or private wars, and justice as a way of suspending the private settling of lawsuits." (Foucault 87)

"Law was not simply a weapon skillfully wielded by monarchs; it was the monarchic system's mode of manifestation and the form of its acceptability.  In Western societies since the Middle Ages, the exercise of power has always been formulated in terms of law." (Foucault 87)

"Political criticism availed itself, therefore, of all the juridical thinking that had accompanied the development of the monarchy, in order to condemn the latter; but it did not challenge the principle which held that law had to be the very form of power, and that power always had to be exercised in the form of law." (Foucault 88)

"At bottom, despite the differences in epochs and objectives, the representation of power has remained under the spell of monarchy.  In political thought and analysis, we still have not cut off the head of the king.  Hence the importance that the theory of power gives to the problem of right and violence, law and illegality, freedom and will, and especially the state and sovereignty (even if the latter is questioned insofar as it is personified in a collective being and no longer a sovereign individual).  To conceive of power on the basis of these problems is to conceive of it in terms of a historical form that is characteristic of our societies: the juridical monarchy.  Characteristic yet transitory.  For while many of its forms have persisted to the present, it has gradually been penetrated by quite new mechanisms of power that are probably irreducible to the representation of law.  As we shall see, these power mechanisms are, at least in part, those that, beginning in the eighteenth century, took charge of men's existence, men as living bodies." (Foucault 88-89)

"the new methods of power whose operation is not ensured by right but by technique, not by law but by normalization, not by punishment but by control, methods that are employed on all levels and in forms that go beyond the state and its apparatus." (Foucault 89)

"It is this juridical representation that is still at work in recent analyses concerning the relationships of power to sex.  But the problem is not to know whether desire is alien to power, whether it is prior to the law as is often thought to be the case, when it is not rather the law that is perceived as constituting it.  This question is beside the point." (Foucault 89)

"One remains attached to a certain image of power-law, of power-sovereignty, which was traced out by the theoreticians of right and the monarchic institution.  It is this image that we must break free of, that is, of the theoretical privilege of law and sovereignty, if we wish to analyze power within the concrete and historical framework of its operation." (Foucault 90)

"let us assume... that a somewhat careful scrutiny will show that power in modern societies has not in fact governed sexuality through law and sovereignty; let us suppose that historical analysis has revealed the presence of a veritable 'technology' of sex, one that is much more complex and above all much more positive than the mere effect of a 'defense' could be" (Foucault 90)

"We must at the same time conceive of sex without the law, and power without the king." (Foucault 91)


2.  Method

"By power, I do not mean 'Power' as a group of institutions and mechanisms that ensure the subservience of the citizens of a given state.  By power, I do not mean, either, a mode of subjugation which, in contrast to violence, has the form of the rule.  Finally, I do not have in mind a general system of domination exerted by one group over another, a system whose effects, through successive derivations, pervade the entire social body.  The analysis, made in terms of power, must not assume that the sovereignty of the state, the form of the law, or the over-all unity of a domination are given at the outset; rather, these are only the terminal forms power takes.  It seems to me that power must be understood in the first instance as the multiplicity of force relations immanent in the sphere in which they operate and which constitute their own organization; as the process which, through ceaseless struggles and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or reverses them; as the support which these force relations find in one another, thus forming a chain or system, or on the contrary, the disjunctions and contradictions which isolate them from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which they take effect, whose general design or institutional crystallization is embodied in the state apparatus, in the formulation of the law, in the various social hegemonies." (Foucault 92-93)

"it is the moving substrate of force relations which, by virtue of their inequality, constantly engender states of power" (Foucault 93)

"Power is everywhere; not because it embraces everything, but because it comes from everywhere.  And 'Power,' insofar as it is permanent, repetitious, inert, and self-reproducing, is simply the over-all effect that emerges from all these mobilities, the concatenation that rests on each of them and seeks in turn to arrest their movement.  One needs to be nominalistic, no doubt: power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society." (Foucault 93)

"Power is not something that is acquired, seized, or shared, something that one holds on to or allows to slip away; power is exercised from innumerable points, in the interplay of nonegalitarian and mobile relations." (Foucault 94)

"Relations of power are not in a position of exteriority with respect to other types of relationship (economic processes, knowledge relationships, sexual relations), but are immanent in the latter; the are the immediate effects of the divisions, inequalities, and disequilibriums which occur in the latter, and conversely they are the internal conditions of these differentiations; relations of power are not in superstructural positions, with merely a role of prohibition or accompaniment; they have a directly productive role, wherever they come into play." (Foucault 94)

"Power comes from below; that is, there is no binary and all-encompassing opposition between rulers and ruled at the root of power relations" (Foucault 94)

"Power relations are both intentional and nonsubjective.  If they are intelligible, this is not because they are the effect of another instance that 'explains' them, but rather because they are imbued, through and through, with calculation: there is no power that is exercised without a series of aims and objectives." (Foucault 94-95)

"the rationality of power is characterized by tactics that are often quite explicit at the restricted level where they are inscribed (the local cynicism of power), tactics which, becoming connected to one another, attracting and propagating one another, but finding their base of support and their condition elsewhere, end by forming comprehensive systems: the logic is perfectly clear, the aims decipherable, and yet is it often the case that no one is there to have invented them" (Foucault 95)

"Where there is power, there is resistance, and yet, or rather consequently, this resistance is never in a position of exteriority in relation to power." (Foucault 95)

"the strictly relational character of power relationships.  Their existence depends on a multiplicity of points of resistance: these play the role of adversary, target, support, or handle in power relations.  These points of resistance are present everywhere in the power network.  Hence there is no single locus of great Refusal, no soul of revolt, source of all rebellions, or pure law of the revolutionary.  Instead there is a plurality of resistances, each of them a special case... by definition, they can only exist in the strategic field of power relations." (Foucault 95-96)

"Just as the network of power relations ends by forming a dense web that passes through apparatuses and institutions, without being exactly localized in them, so too the swarm of points of resistance traverses social stratifications and individual unities." (Foucault 96)

"if it is true that Machiavelli was among the few -- and this no doubt was the scandal of his 'cynicism' -- who conceived the power of the Prince in terms of force relationships, perhaps we need to go one step further, do without the persona of the Prince, and decipher power mechanisms on the basis of a strategy that is immanent in force relationships." (Foucault 97)

the real question about sex and the discourses of truth:  "In a specific type of discourse on sex, and in a specific form of extortion of truth, appearing historically and in specific places (around the child's body, apropos of women's sex, in connection with practices restricting births, and so on), what were the most immediate, the most local power relations at work?" (Foucault 97)

"How were these power relations linked to one another according to the logic of a great strategy, which in retrospect takes on the aspect of a unitary and voluntarist politics of sex?" (Foucault 97)

four rules: 1. rule of immanence; 2. rules of continual variations; 3. rule of double conditioning; 4. rule of the tactical polyvalence of discourses

rule of immanence:  "One must not suppose that there exists a certain sphere of sexuality that would be the legitimate concern of a free and disinterested scientific inquiry were it not the object of mechanisms of prohibition brought to bear by the economic or ideological requirements of power.  If sexuality was constituted as an area of investigation, this was only because relations of power had established it as a possible object; and conversely, if power was able to take it as a target, this was because techniques of knowledge and procedures of discourse were capable of investing it." (Foucault 98)

rules of continual variations:  "We must not look for who has the power in the order of sexuality (men, adults, parents, doctors) and who is deprived of it (women, adolescents, children, patients); nor for who has the right to know and who is forced to remain ignorant.  We must seek rather the pattern of the modifications which the relationships of force imply by the very nature of their process." (Foucault 99)

rule of double conditioning:  "No 'local center,' no 'pattern of transformation' could function if, through a series of sequences, it did not eventually enter into an over-all strategy.  And inversely, no strategy could achieve comprehensive effects if did not gain support from precise and tenuous relations serving, not as its point of application or final outcome, but as its prop and anchor point." (Foucault 99)

"one must conceive of the double conditioning of a strategy by the specificity of possible tactics, and of tactics by the strategic envelope that makes them work." (Foucault 100)

rule of the tactical polyvalence of discourses:  "What is said about sex must not be analyzed simply as the surface of projection of these power mechanisms.  Indeed, it is in discourse that power and knowledge are joined together.  And for this very reason, we must conceive discourse as a series of discontinuous segments whose tactical function is neither uniform nor stable.  To be more precise, we must not imagine a world of discourse divided between accepted discourse and excluded discourse, or between the dominant discourse and the dominated one; but as a multiplicity of discursive elements that can come into play in various strategies."  (Foucault 100)

"Discourses are not once and for all subservient to power or raised up against it, any more than silences are." (Foucault 100-101)

"The extreme discretion of the texts dealing with sodomy -- that utterly confused category -- and the nearly universal reticence in talking about it made possible a twofold operation: on the one hand, there was an extreme severity (punishment by fire was meted out well into the eighteenth century, without there being any substantial protest expressed before the middle of the century), and on the other hand, a tolerance that must have been widespread (which one can deduce indirectly from the infrequency of judicial sentences, and which one glimpses more directly through certain statements concerning societies of men that were thought to exist in the army or in the courts).  There is no question that the appearance in nineteenth-century psychiatry, jurisprudence, and literature of a whole series of discourses on the species and subspecies of homosexuality, inversion, pederasty, and 'psychic hermaphrodism' made possible a strong advance of social controls into this area of 'perversity'; but it also made possible the formation of a 'revers' discourse: homosexuality began to speak in its own behalf, to demand that its legitimacy or 'naturality' be acknowledged, often in the same vocabulary, using the same categories by which it was medically disqualified." (Foucault 101)

"We must not expect the discourses on sex to tell us, above all, what strategy they derive from, or what moral divisions they accompany, or what ideology -- dominant or dominated -- they represent; rather we must question them on the two levels of their tactical productivity (what reciprocal effects of power and knowledge they ensure) and their strategical integration (what conjunction and what force relationship make their utilization necessary in a given episode of the various confrontations that occur)." (Foucault 102)

"In short, it is a question of orienting ourselves to a conception of power which replaces the privilege of law with the viewpoint of the objective, the privilege of prohibition with the viewpoint of tactical efficacy, the privilege of sovereignty with the analysis of a multiple and mobile field of force relations" (Foucault 102)

"it is one of the essential traits of Western societies that the force relationships which for a long time had found expression in war, in every form of warfare, gradually became invested in the order of political power." (Foucault 102)


3.  Domain

"Sexuality must not be described as a stubborn drive, by nature alien and of necessity disobedient to a power which exhausts itself trying to subdue it and often fails to control it entirely.  It appears rather as an especially dense transfer point for relations of power: between men and women, young people and old people, parents and offspring, teachers and students, priests and laity, an administration and a population.  Sexuality is not the most intractable element in power relations, but rather one of those endowed with the greatest instrumentality" (Foucault 103)

"the idea that there have been repeated attempts, by various means, to reduce all of sex to its reproductive function, its heterosexual and adult form, and its matrimonial legacy fails to take into account the manifold objectives aimed for, the manifold means employed in the different sexual politics concerned with the two sexes, the different age groups and social classes." (Foucault 103)

"four great strategic unities which, beginning in the eighteenth century, formed specific mechanisms of knowledge and power centering on sex" (Foucault 103):  1. a hysterization of women's bodies; 2. a pedagogization of children's sex; 3. a socialization of procreative behavior; 4. a psychiatrization of perverse pleasure

hysterization of women's bodies:  "a threefold process whereby the feminine body was analyzed -- qualified and disqualified -- a being thoroughly saturated with sexuality; whereby it was integrated into the sphere of medical practices, by reason of a pathology intrinsic to it; whereby, finally, it was placed in organic communication with the social body..., the family space..., and the life of children...: the Mother, with her negative image of 'nervous woman,' constituted the most visible form of this hysterization." (Foucault 104)

pedagogization of children's sex:  "a double assertion that practically all children indulge or are prone to indulge in sexual activity; and that, being unwarranted, at the same time 'natural' and 'contrary to nature,' this sexual activity posed physical and moral, individual and collective dangers" (Foucault 104)

socialization of procreative behavior:  "an economic socialization via all the incitements and restrictions, the 'social' and fiscal measures brought to bear on the fertility of couples; a political socialization achieved through the 'responsiblization' of couples with regard to the social body as a whole..., and a medical socialization carried out by attributing a pathogenic value -- for the individual and the species -- to birth-control practices" (Foucault 104-105)

psychiatrization of perverse pleasure:  "the sexual instinct was isolated as a separate biological and psychical instinct; a clinical analysis was made of all the forms of anomalies by which it could be afflicted; it was assigned a role of normalization of pathologization with respect to all behavior; and finally, a corrective technology was sought for these anomalies." (Foucault 105)

"four privileged targets of knowledge, which were also targets and anchorage points for the ventures of knowledge:  the hysterical woman, the masturbating child, the Malthusian couple, and the perverse adult." (Foucault 105)

"In actual fact, what was involved, rather, was the very production of sexuality.  Sexuality must not be through of as a kind of natural given which power tries to hold in check, or as an obscure domain which knowledge tries gradually to uncover.  It is the name that can be given to a historical construct: not a furtive reality that is difficult to grasp, but a great surface network in which the stimulation of bodies, the intensification of pleasures, the incitement to discourse, the formation of special knowledges, the strengthening of controls and resistances, are linked to one another, in accordance with a few major strategies of knowledge and power." (Foucault 105-106)

"sex gave rise, in every society, to a *deployment of alliance*: a system of marriage, of fixation and development of kinship ties, of transmission of names and possessions... Wester societies created and deployed a new apparatus which was superimposed on the previous one, and which, without completely supplanting the latter, helped to reduce its importance.  I am speaking of the *deployment of sexuality*: like the *deployment of alliance*, it connects up with the circuit of sexual partners, but in a completely different way.... the deployment of sexuality operates according to mobile, polymorphous, and contingent techniques of power.... the deployment of sexuality... engenders a continual extension of areas and forms of control.... is concerned with the sensations of the body, the quality of pleasures, and the nature of impressions, however tenuous or imperceptible these may be.... the deployment of sexuality is linked to the economy through numerous and subtle relays, the main one of which, however, is the body -- the body that produces and consumes." (Foucault 106-107)

"The deployment of sexuality has its reason for being, not in reproducing itself, but in proliferating, innovating, annexing, creating, and penetrating bodies in an increasingly detailed way, and in controlling populations in an increasingly comprehensive way.  We are compelled, then, to accept three or four hypotheses which run counter to the one on which the theme of a sexuality repressed by the modern forms of society is based: sexuality is tied to recent devices of power; it has been expanding at an increasing rate since the seventeenth century; the arrangement that has sustained it is not governed by reproduction; it has been linked from the outset with an intensification of the body -- with its exploitation as an object of knowledge and an element in relations of power."  (Foucault 107)

"there was a gradual progression away from the problematic of relations toward a problematic of the 'flesh,' that is, of the body, sensation, the nature of pleasure, the more secret forms of enjoyment or acquiescence." (Foucault 108)

"The family, in its contemporary form, must not be understood as a social, economic, and political structure of alliance that excludes or at least restrains sexuality, that diminishes it as much as possible, preserving only its useful functions.  On the contrary, its role is to anchor sexuality and provide with with a permanent support.  It ensures the production of a sexuality that is not homogenous with the privileges of alliance, while making it possible for the systems of alliance to be imbued with a new tactic of power which they would otherwise be impervious to.  The family is the interchange of sexuality and alliance" (Foucault 108)

"a number of facts: that since the eighteenth century the family has become an obligatory locus of affects, feelings, love; that sexuality has its privileged point of development in the family; that for this reason sexuality is 'incestuous' from the start" (Foucault 108-109)

"in a society such as ours, where the family is the most active site of sexuality, and where it is doubtless the exigencies of the latter which maintain and prolong its existence, incest -- for different reasons altogether and in a completely different way -- occupies a central place; it is constantly being solicited and refused; it is an object of obsession and attraction, a dreadful secret and an indispensable pivot." (Foucault 109)

the prohibition of incest "was found to be a means of self-defense, not against an incestuous desire, but against the expansion and the implications of this deployment of sexuality which had been set up, but which, among its many benefits, had the disadvantage of ignoring the laws and juridical forms of alliance." (Foucault 109)

"For this is the paradox of a society which, from the eighteenth century to the present, has created so many technologies of power that are foreign to the concept of law: it fears the effects and proliferations of those technologies and attempts to recode them in forms of law." (Foucault 109)

"What has taken place since the seventeenth century can be interpreted in the following manner: the deployment of sexuality which first developed on the fringes of familial institutions (in the direction of conscience and pedagogy, for example) gradually became focused on the family... In the family, parents and relatives became the chief agents of a deployment of sexuality which drew its outside support from doctors, educators, and later psychiatrists... Then these new personage made their appearance: the nervous woman, the frigid wife, the indifferent mother -- or worse, the mother beset by murderous obsessions -- the impotent, sadistic, perverse husband, the hysterical or neurasthenic girl, the precocious and already exhausted child, and the young homosexual who rejects marriage or neglects this wife.  These were the combined figures of an alliance gone bad and an abnormal sexuality" (Foucault 110)

"caught in the grip of this deployment of sexuality which had invested it from without, contributing to its solidification into its modern form, the family broadcast the long complaint of its sexual suffering to doctors, educators, psychiatrists, priests, and pastors, to all the 'experts' who would listen.  It was as if it had suddenly discovered the dreadful secret of what had always been hinted at and inculcated in it: the family, the keystone of alliance, was the germ of all the misfortunes of sex." (Foucault 111)

"The family was the crystal in the deployment of sexuality: it seemed to be the source of a sexuality which it actually only reflected and diffracted." (Foucault 111)

on psychoanalysis:  "The guarantee that one would find the parents-children relationship at the root of everyone's sexuality made it possible -- even when everything seemed to point to the reverse process -- to keep the deployment of sexuality coupled to the system of alliance." (Foucault 113)

"Hence the domain we must analyze in the different studies that will follow the present volume is that deployment of sexuality: its formation on the basis of the Christian notion of the flesh, and its development through the four great strategies that were deployed in the nineteenth century: the sexualization of children, the hysterization of women, the specification of the perverted, and the regulation of populations -- all strategies that went by way of a family which must be viewed, not as a powerful agency of prohibition, but as a major factor of sexualization." (Foucault 113-14)


4.  Periodization

"The history of sexuality supposes two ruptures if one tries to center it on the mechanisms of repression.  The first, occurring in the course of the seventeenth century, was characterized by the advent of the great prohibitions... The second, a twentieth-century phenomenon, was really less a rupture than an inflexion of the curve: this was the moment when the mechanisms of repression were seen as beginning to loosen their grip" (Foucault 115)

"We must attempt to trace the chronology of these devices: the inventions, the instrumental mutations, and the renovations of previous techniques.  But there is also the calendar of their utilization to consider, the chronology of their diffusion and of the effects (of subjugation and resistance) they produced.  These multiple datings will not coincide with the great repressive cycle that is ordinarily situated between the seventeenth and the twentieth centuries." (Foucault 115)

around the end of the eighteenth century "there emerged a completely new technology of sex; new in that for the most part it escaped the ecclesiastical institution without being truly independent of the thematics of sin.... sex became a matter that required the social body as a whole, and virtually all of its citizens, to place themselves under surveillance.  New too for the fact that it expanded along three axes: that of pedagogy, having as its objective the specific sexuality of children; that of medicine, whose objective was the sexual physiology peculiar to women; and last, that of demography, whose objective was the spontaneous or concerted regulation of births." (Foucault 116)

"A visible continuity, therefore, but one that did not prevent a major transformation: from that time on, the technology of sex was ordered in relation to the medical institution, the exigency of normality, and -- instead of the question of death and everlasting punishment -- the problem of life and illness.  The flesh was brought down to the level of the organism." (Foucault 117)

"the analysis of heredity was placing sex (sexual relations, venereal diseases, matrimonial alliances, perversions) in a position of 'biological responsibility' with regard to the species... Whence the medical -- but also political -- project for organizing a state management of marriages, births, and life expectancies; sex and its fertility had to be administered" (Foucault 118)

on psychoanalysis:  "in the great family of technologies of sex, which goes so far back into the history of the Christian West, of all those institutions that set out in the nineteenth century to medicalize sex, it was the one that, up to the decade of the forties, rigorously opposed the political and institutional effects of the perversion-heredity-degenerescence system." (Foucault 119)

"If one writes the history of sexuality in terms of repression, relating this repression to the utilization of labor capacity, one must suppose that sexual controls were the more intense and meticulous as they were directed at the poorer classes; one has to assume that they followed the path of greatest domination and the most systematic exploitation... But this does not appear to be the way things actually happened.  On the contrary, the most rigorous techniques were formed and, more particularly, applied first, and with the greatest intensity, in the economically privileged and politically dominant classes." (Foucault 120)

"The same can be said of the family as an agency of control and a point of sexual saturation: it was in the 'bourgeois' or 'aristocratic' family that the sexuality of children and adolescents was first problematized, and feminine sexuality medicalized; it was the first to be alerted to the potential pathology of sex, the urgent need to keep it under close watch and to devise a rational technology of correction." (Foucault 120)

"It is worth remembering that the first figure to be invested by the deployment of sexuality, one of the first to be 'sexualized,' was the 'idle' woman." (Foucault 121)

"For their part, the working classes managed for a long time to escape the deployment of 'sexuality.'" (Foucault 121)

"The last stage came at the end of the nineteenth century with the development of the juridical and medical control of perversions, for the sake of a general protection of society and the race.  It can be said that this was the moment when the deployment of 'sexuality,' elaborated in its more complex and intense forms, by and for the privileged classes, spread through the entire social body." (Foucault 122)

"It seems in fact that what was involved was not an asceticism, in any case not a renunciation of pleasure or a disqualification of the flesh, but on the contrary an intensification of the body, a problematization of health and its operational terms: it was a question of techniques for maximizing life." (Foucault 122-23)

"it has to be seen as the self-affirmation of one class rather than the enslavement of another: a defense, a protection, a strengthening, and an exaltation that were eventually extended to others -- at the cost of different transformations -- as a means of social control and political subjugation." (Foucault 123)

"What was formed was a political ordering of life, not through an enslavement of others, but through an affirmation of self."  (Foucault 123)

"Sex is not that part of the body which the bourgeoisie was forced to disqualify or nullify in order to put those whom it dominated to work.  It is that aspect of itself which troubled and preoccupied it more than any other, begged and obtained its attention, and which it cultivated with a mixture of fear, curiosity, delight, and excitement.  The bourgeoisie made this element identical with its body, or at least subordinated the latter to the former by attributing to it a mysterious and undefined power; it staked its life and death on sex by making it responsible for its future welfare; it placed its hopes for the future in sex by imagining it to have ineluctable effects on generations to come; it subordinated its soul to sex by conceiving of it as what constituted the soul's most secret and determinant part." (Foucault 123-24)

"The emphasis on the body should undoubtedly be linked to the process of growth and establishment of bourgeois hegemony:  not, however, because of the market value assumed by labor capacity, but because of what the 'cultivation' of its own body could represent politically, economically, and historically for the present and the future of the bourgeoisie." (Foucault 125)

"There is little question that one of the primordial forms of class consciousness is the affirmation of the body; at least, this was the case for the bourgeoisie during the eighteenth century.  It converted the blue blood of the nobles into a sound organism and a healthy sexuality.  One understands why it took such a long time and was so unwilling to acknowledge that other classes had a body and a sex -- precisely those classes it was exploiting." (Foucault 126)

on the spread of the deployment of sexuality from the bourgeoisie to the working classes:  "there had to be established a whole technology of control which made it possible for them to keep that body and sexuality, finally conceded to them, under surveillance" (Foucault 126)

"If it is true that sexuality is the set of effects produced in bodies, behaviors, and social relations by a certain deployment deriving from a complex political technology, one has to admit that this deployment does not operate in symmetrical fashion with respect to the social classes, and consequently, that it does not produce the same effects in them." (Foucault 127)

"Somewhat similar to the way in which, at the end of the eighteenth century, the bourgeoisie set its own body and its precious sexuality against the valorous blood of the nobles, at the end of the the nineteenth century it sought to redefine the specific character of its sexuality relative to that of others, subjecting it to a thorough differential review, and tracing a dividing line that would set apart and protect its body.  This line was not the same as the one which founded sexuality, but rather a bar running through that sexuality; this was the taboo that constituted the difference, or at least the manner in which the taboo was applied and the rigor with which it was imposed.  It was here that the theory of repression -- which was gradually expanded to cover the entire deployment of sexuality, so that the latter came to be explained in terms of a generalized taboo -- had its point of origin." (Foucault 127-28)

"Psychoanalysis comes in at this juncture: both a theory of the essential interrelatedness of the law and desire, and a technique for relieving the effects of the taboo where its rigor makes it pathogenic." (Foucault 129)

"The problem of incest is still significant in this regard.  On the one hand, as we have seen, its prohibition was posited as an absolutely universal principle... But in practice psychoanalysis gave itself the task of alleviating the effects of repression (for those who were in a position to resort to psychoanalysis) that this prohibition was capable of causing; it allowed individuals to express their incestuous desire in discourse." (Foucault 129)

"Whereas the deployment of sexuality had been intensifying affective relations and physical proximity since the eighteenth century, and although there had occurred a perpetual incitement to incest in the bourgeois family, the regime of sexuality applied to the lower classes on the contrary involved the exclusion of incestuous practices or at least their displacement into another form." (Foucault 129-30)

"We must not forget that the discovery of the Oedipus complex was contemporaneous with the juridical organization of loss of parental authority" (Foucault 130)

"The history of the deployment of sexuality, as it has evolved since the classical age, can serve as an archaeology of psychoanalysis." (Foucault 130)

"between the two world wars there was formed, around Reich, the historico-political critique of sexual repression.  The importance of this critique and its impact on reality were substantial.  But the very possibility of its success was tied to the fact that it always unfolded within the deployment of sexuality, and not outside or against it." (Foucault 131)


Part Five: Right of Death and Power over Life

"For a long time, one of the characteristic privileges of sovereign power was the right to decide life and death." (Foucault 135)

"the power of life and death was not an absolute privilege: it was conditioned by the defense of the sovereign, and his own survival." (Foucault 135)

"The sovereign exercised his right of life only by exercising his right to kill, or by refraining from killing... The right which was formulated as the 'power of life and death' was in reality the right to *take* life or *let* live." (Foucault 136)

"Power in this instance was essentially a right of seizure: of things, time, bodies, and ultimately life itself; it culminated in the privilege to seize hold of life in order to suppress it." (Foucault 136)

"'Deduction' had tended to be no longer the major form of power but merely one element among others, working to incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize the forces under it: a power bent on generating forced, making them grow, and ordering them, rather than one dedicated to impeding them, making them submit, or destroying them." (Foucault 136)

"The death that was based on the right of the sovereign is not manifested as simply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure, maintain, or develop its life." (Foucault 136)

"this formidable power of death -- and this is perhaps what accounts for part of its force and the cynicism with which it has so greatly expanded its limits -- now presents itself as the counterpart of a power that exerts a positive influence on life, that endeavors to administer, optimize, and multiply it" (Foucault 137)

"The atomic situation is now at the end point of this process: the power to expose a whole population to death is the underside of the power to guarantee an individual's continued existence." (Foucault 137)

"If genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population." (Foucault 137)

"How could power exercise its highest prerogatives by putting people to death, when its main role was to ensure, sustain, and multiply life, to put this life in order?  For such a power, execution was at the same time a limit, a scandal, and a contradiction.  Hence capital punishment could not be maintained except by invoking less the enormity of the crime itself than the monstrosity of the criminal, his incorrigibility, and the safeguard of society." (Foucault 138)

"the ancient right to *take* life or *let* live was replaced by a power to *foster* life or *disallow* it to the point of death." (Foucault 138)

"Now it is over life, throughout its unfolding, that power establishes its dominion; death is power's limit, the moment that escapes it; death becomes the most secret aspect of existence, the most 'private.' It is not surprising that suicide -- once a crime, since it was a way to usurp the power of death which the sovereign along, whether the one here below or the Lord above, had the right to exercise -- became, in the course of the nineteenth century, one of the first conducts to enter into the sphere of sociological analysis; it testified to the individual and private right to die, at the borders and in the interstices of power that was exercised over life.  This determination to die, strange and yet so persistent and constant in its manifestation, and consequently so difficult to explain as being due to particular circumstances or individual accidents, was one of the first astonishments of a society in which political power had assigned itself the task of administering life." (Foucault 138-39)

"this power over life evolved in two basic forms... One of these poles -- the first to be formed, it seems -- centered on the body as a machine... the *disciplines*: an *anatomo-politics of the human body*.  The second, formed somewhat later, focused on the species body... *regulatory controls: a bio-politics of the population*. The disciplines of the body and the regulations of the population constituted the two poles around which the organization of power over life was deployed.  The setting up, in the course of the classical age, of this great bipolar technology -- anatomic and biological, individualizing and specifying, directed toward the performances of the body, with attention to the processes of life -- characterized a power whose highest function was perhaps no longer to kill, but to invest life through and through." (Foucault 139)

"there was an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of populations, marking the beginning of an era of 'bio-power'." (Foucault 140)

"This bio-power was without question and indispensable element in the development of capitalism; the latter would not have been possible without the controlled insertion of bodies into the machinery of production and the adjustments of the phenomena of population to economic processes." (Foucault 140-141)

"If the development of the great instruments of the state, as *institutions* of power, ensured the maintenance of production relations, the rudiments of anatomo- and bio-politics, created in the eighteenth century as *techniques* of power present at every level of the social body and utilized by very diverse institutions (the family and the army, schools and the police, individual medicine and the administration of collective bodies), operated in the sphere of economic processes, their development, and the forces working to sustain them."  (Foucault 141)

"The investment of the body, its valorization, and the distributive management of its forces were at the time indispensable." (Foucault 141)

"what occurred in the eighteenth century in some Western countries, an event bound up with the development of capitalism, was a different phenomenon having perhaps a wider impact than the new morality; this was nothing less than the entry of life into history, that is, the entry of phenomena peculiar to the life of the human species into the order of knowledge and power, into the sphere of political techniques." (Foucault 141-42)

"it was the taking charge of life, more than the threat of death, that gave power its access even to the body.  If one can apply the term *bio-history* to the pressures through which the movements of life and the processes of history interfere with one another, one would have to speak of *bio-power* to designate what brought life and its mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculations and made knowledge-power an agent of transformation of human life.  It is not that life has been totally integrated into techniques that govern and administrate it; it constantly escapes them.... But what might be called a society's 'threshold of modernity' has been reached when the life of the species is wagered on its own political strategies." (Foucault 143)

"Another consequence of this development of bio-power was the growing importance assumed by the action of the norm, at the expense of the juridical system of the law.  Law cannot help but be armed, and its arm, *par excellence*, is death; to those who transgress it, it replies, at least as a last resort, with that absolute menace.  The law always refers to the sword.  But a power whose task is to take charge of life needs continuous regulatory and corrective mechanisms." (Foucault 144)

"I do not mean to say that the law fades into the background or that the institutions of justice tend to disappear, but rather than the law operates more and more as a norm, and that the judicial institution is increasingly incorporated into a continuum of apparatuses (medical, administrative, and so on) whose functions are for the most part regulatory.  A normalizing society is the historical outcome of a technology of power centered on life." (Foucault 144)

"The 'right' to life, to one's body, to health, to happiness, to the satisfaction of needs, and beyond all the oppressions or 'alienations,' the 'right' to rediscover what one is and all that one can be, this 'right' -- which the classical juridical system was utterly incapable of comprehending -- what the political response to all these new procedures of power which did not derive, either, from the traditional right of sovereignty." (Foucault 145)

"This is the background that enables us to understand the importance assumed by sex as a political issue.  It was at the pivot of the two axes along which developed the entire political technology of life.  On the one hand it was tied to the disciplines of the body: the harnessing, intensification, and distribution of forces, the adjustment and economy of energies.  On the other hand, it was applied to the regulation of populations, through all the far-reaching effects of its activity.  It fitted in both categories at once, giving rise to infinitesimal surveillances, permanent controls, extremely meticulous orderings of space, indeterminate medical or psychological examinations, to an entire micro-power concerned with the body.  But it gave rise as well to comprehensive measures, statistical assessments, and interventions aimed at the entire social body or at groups taken as a whole.  Sex was a means of access both to the life of the body and the life of the species." (Foucault 145-46)

"Whence the importance of the four great lines of attack along which the politics of sex advanced for two centuries.  Each one was a way of combining disciplinary techniques with regulative methods.... the sexualization of children was accomplished in the form of a campaign for the health of the race... the hysterization of women, which involved a thorough medicalization of their bodies and their sex, was carried out in the name of the responsibility they owed to the health of their children... It was the reverse relationship that applied in the case of birth controls and the psychiatrization of perversions: here the intervention was regulatory in nature, but it had to rely on the demand for individual disciplines and constraints" (Foucault 146-47)

"A society of blood -- I was tempted to say, of 'sanguinity' -- where power spoke *through* blood: the honor of war, the fear of famine, the triumph of death, the sovereign with his sword, executioners, and tortures; blood was *a reality with a symbolic function*.  We, on the other hand, are in a society of 'sex,' or rather a society 'with a sexuality': the mechanisms of power are addressed to the body, to life, to what causes it to proliferate, to what reinforces the species, its stamina, its ability to dominate, or its capacity for being used.  Through the themes of health, progeny, race, the future of the species, the vitality of the social body, power spoke *of* sexuality and *to* sexuality; the latter was not a mark or a symbol, it was an object and a target."  (Foucault 147)

"Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century, the thematics of blood was sometimes called on to lend its entire historical weight toward revitalizing the type of political power that was exercised through the devices of sexuality.  Racism took shape at this point (racism in its modern, 'biologizing,' statist form): it was then that a whole politics of settlement (*peuplement*), family, marriage, education, social hierarchization, and property, accompanied by a long series of permanent interventions at the level of the body, conduct, health, and everyday life, received their color and their justification from the mythical concern with protecting the purity of the blood and ensuring the triumph of the race." (Foucault 149)

"People are going to say that I am dealing in a historicism which is more careless than radical; that I am evading the biologically established existence of sexual functions for the benefit of phenomena that are variable, perhaps, but fragile, secondary, and ultimately superficial; and that I speak of sexuality as if sex did not exist." (Foucault 150-51)

"Now, it is precisely this idea of sex *in itself* that we cannot accept without examination.  Is 'sex' really the anchorage point that supports the manifestations of sexuality, or is it not rather a complex idea that was formed inside the deployment of sexuality?" (Foucault 152)

"the notion of sex brought about a fundamental reversal; it made it possible to invert the representation of the relationships of power to sexuality, causing the latter to appear, not in its essential and positive relation to power, but as being rooted in a specific and irreducible urgency which power tries as best as it can to dominate; thus the idea of 'sex' makes it possible to evade what gives 'power' its power; it enables one to conceive power solely as law and taboo." (Foucault 155)

"We must not make the mistake of thinking that sex is an autonomous agency which secondarily produces manifold effects of sexuality over the entire length of its surface of contact with power.  On the contrary, sex is the most speculative, most ideal, and most internal element in a deployment of sexuality organized by power in its grip on bodies and their materiality, their forces, energies, sensations, and pleasures." (Foucault 155)

"It is through sex -- in fact, an imaginary point determined by the deployment of sexuality -- that each individual has to pass in order to have access to his own intelligibility (seeing that it is both the hidden aspect and the generative principle of meaning), to the whole of his body (since it is a real and threatened part of it, while symbolically constituting the whole), to his identity (since it joins the force of a drive to the singularity of a history)." (Foucault 155-56)

"Hence the importance we ascribe to it, the reverential fear with which we surround it, the care we take to know it.  Hence the fact that over the centuries it has become more important than our soul, more important almost than our life; and so it is that all the world's enigmas appear frivolous to us compared to this secret, miniscule in each of us, but of a density that makes it more serious than any other.  The Faustian pact, whose temptation has been instilled in us by the deployment of sexuality, is now as follows: to exchange life in its entirety for sex itself, for the truth and sovereignty of sex.  Sex is worth dying for.  It is in this (strictly historical) sense that sex is indeed imbued with the death instinct." (Foucault 156)

"So we must not refer a history of sexuality to the agency of sex; but rather show how 'sex' is historically subordinate to sexuality.  We must not place sex on the side of reality, and sexuality on that of confused ideas and illusions; sexuality is a very real historical formation; it is what gave rise to the notion of sex, as a speculative element necessary to its operation.  We must not think that by saying yes to sex, one says no to power; on the contrary, one tracks along the course laid out by the general deployment of sexuality.  It is the agency of sex that we must break away from, if we aim -- through a tactical reversal of the various mechanisms of sexuality -- to counter the grips of power with the claims of bodies, pleasures, and knowledges, in their multiplicity and their possibility of resistance.  The rallying point for the counterattack against the deployment of sexuality ought not to be sex-desire, but bodies and pleasures." (Foucault 157)

"The irony of this deployment is in having us believe that our 'liberation' is in the balance." (Foucault 159)
