"This is the generative pattern, and we can find examples of it at every layer of the network hourglass:

1. An idea originates in a backwater.
2. It is ambitious but incomplete. It is partially implemented and released anyway, embracing the ethos of the procrastination principle.
3. Contribution is welcomed from all corners, resulting in an influx of usage.
4. Success is achieved beyond any expectation, and a higher profile draws even more usage.
5. Success is cut short: 'There goes the neighborhood' as newer users are not conversant with the idea of experimentation and contribution, and other users are prepared to exploit the openness of the system to undesirable ends.
6. There is a movement toward enclosure to prevent the problems that arise from the system's very popularity.

The paradox of generativity is that with an openness to unanticipated change, we can end up in bad -- and non-generative -- waters." (99)

"Reputation systems have many pitfalls and can be gamed, but the scholarship seems to indicate that they work reasonably well.  There are many ways reputation systems might be improved, but at their core they rely on the number of people rating each other in good faith well exceeding the number of people seeking to game the system" (218)

"generativity is, at its core, not a technology project.  It is an education project, an exercise in intellect and community, the founding concepts of the university." (244-25)
