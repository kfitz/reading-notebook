Striphas, Ted.  The Late Age of Print: Everyday Book Culture from Consumerism to Control.  New York:  Columbia University Press, 2009.


Introduction: The Late Age of Print

"The familiar story of the morbidity and decline of printed books is not, however, the one driving this book." (2)

"the late age of print underscores the enduring role of books in shaping habits of thought, conduct, and expression.  At the same time, it draws attention to the ways in which the social, economic, and material coordinates of books have been changing in relation to other media, denser forms of industrial organization, shifting patterns of work and leisure, new laws governing commodity ownership and use, and a host of other factors." (3)

the book "explores the history and conditions by which books have become ubiquitous and mundane social artifacts in and of our time" (4)

"In this book I attempt to glimpse the contours of the late age of print in some of the most prosaic activities characteristic of book culture today: browsing around a large retail bookstore; selling books online; scanning a book's bar code at the checkout counter; reading and discussing a popular work with a group; waiting on a line to buy a hotly anticipated best seller; and creating spinoffs based on popular literary characters, to name just a few." (5)

"I argue that books were integral to the making of a modern, connected consumer culture in the twentieth century, and that today they form a key part of consumer capitalism's slow slide into what I call, following Henri Lefebvre, a 'society of controlled consumption.'" (5)

"The notion that books belong at a significant remove from the realm of economic necessity is one of the most entrenched myths of contemporary book culture." (6)

"It may be that the 'crisis' of books is linked not only to purported decreases in the amount of reading but also to people's misgivings about -- or, more accurately, their lack of historical perspective on -- the economic organization of the book trade." (6)

"Book publishing was one of the first large-scale industries to coalesce as such, and it did so in part by pioneering the rationalization and standardization of mass-production techniques." (7)

"Clearly, the moral value people attribute to books provided an alibi for their existence as mass-produced merchandise." (8)

book "explores not only how books have become ubiquitous social artifacts but also the cultural work involved in transforming them from industrially produced stuff into 'sacred products' (and sometimes back again)." (9)

reading as "a range of techniques and activities whereby individuals and groups interact with the manifest content of books" (12)

"this book tends to decenter reading. My purpose in doing so is to provide a more detailed picture of the ways in which people use books beyond treating them as vessels for meaningful, imaginative, or communicative encounters." (12)

"a dynamic investigation of the social and material circuitry not only through which books are constantly traveling but without which books as many people now know them probably wouldn't exist at all." (15)

"E-books... portend a shift away from the widespread private ownership of salable consumer goods to the periodic licensing of intellectual properties -- representing a significant shift to a foundational logic of consumer capitalism." (16)

"in the late age of print emergent techniques of control increasingly impinge on the creative ways in which people have for decades made use of books and other mass-produced consumer goods." (18)


1. E-Books and the Digital Future

"it's not just the physical form of printed books that seems to be imperiled in the so-called digital age.  Critics worry that their content could be jeopardized as well." (22)

"e-books are an emergent technological form by which problems pertaining to the ownership and circulation of printed books are simultaneously posed and resolved." (22)

on Birkerts and his typewriter:  "only a profound act of forgetting could sustain Birkerts's claims about the transparency of typewriting.... Like it or not, an electrical charge infuses all of Birkerts's writing, a charge produced by the very machine IBM touted in a 1962 advertising campaign as a device not for slowing you down but for making you 'faster... more productive.'" (25)

Heidegger: "Mechanical writing deprives the hand of its rank in the realm of the written word and degrades to word to a means of communication.... The typewriter makes everyone look the same." (qtd in 25)

"if the history and politics of e-books cannot be reduced to the formal qualities they may or may not share with printed books, then we're confronted with two specific challenges: to explore a more diverse set of connections e-books share with both printed books and a host of other technologies; and to account for the embeddedness of e-books in a broader context of social, legal, and political-economic relations." (26)

origins of 20th c. growth in publishing industry in the introduction of bookshelves into American homes

"Rather than stressing the literariness of particular titles or the pleasures of reading them, Lippincott enjoined his colleagues to consider how built-in bookshelves could facilitate the mass accumulation of books largely on the basis of their formal characteristics and their capacity as a whole to add flare [sic] to modern home décor." (28)

"Bookshelves thus embodied a specific middle-class habitus expressed in and through knowledge work and the collapse of labor and leisure." (31)

"The movement to challenge and regulate how /consumers/ disposed of mass-produced cultural goods -- specifically printed books -- would only crystallize around 1930, following another book industry price war, and come to a head a few decades later with the proliferation of photocopying techniques." (34)

"a contest in the spring of 1931 'to look for a pejorative word for the book borrower, the wretch who raised hell with book sales and deprived authors of earned royalties'" (35) -- connect to "scofflaw," etc; winner: "book sneak"

"Taken together, the litigation challenging the unrestricted photocopying of copyrighted books, publishers' fears about the pass-along book trade, and the movement to establish a public lending right in the United States signaled a shift in attitude toward the economic and cultural value of printed books and other mass-produced commodities." (38)

"IP law doesn't so much protect against the /process/ of duplicating copyrighted materials as redress the /result/ of their duplication.  Digital encryption, on the other hand, prohibits the duplication and circulation of e-books before acts of duplication can occur -- in extreme cases by erasing e-books after only a single use." (43)

"Given that most of today's most popular, commercially available e-book technologies allow cultural producers to micromanage the persistence, use, and circulation of content, these technologies are symptomatic of -- indeed, further -- the tense and uneven process of transforming three core principles of consumer capitalism: the belief that the widespread private ownership and accumulation of mass-produced consumer goods is desirable from the standpoint of capitalist production; the assumption that the sale of a certain item implies the more or less complete transfer of ownership rights to that item; and the principle that commodity ownership consists, in part, in the right to make use of the goods you've purchased with minimal -- and, ideally no -- outside interference by the party from whom you've purchased them." (45)

"E-books don't suggest a waning of consumer capitalism.  On the contrary, they point to its intensification or, rather, to the emergence of new practices of /controlled consumption/" (45)


2.  The Big-Box Bookstore Blues

"Dismissing the value of an industrial society may be an exercise in futility.  As WIlliams understood, however, embracing an industrial society's excesses may be an even more damaging exercise in servility." (50)

"The familiar refrain 'corporate big-box bookstores drive local independents out of business' has calcified into a kind of commonsense mantra, so that imagining more complicated relations of causality has become somewhat difficult of late." (52)

"Without a clear sense of history and of the ways in which these big-box bookstores affect daily life in concrete contexts, it becomes easy for critics to dismiss them as soulless, homogeneous institutions... What other stories, I wonder, might present themselves were we to imagine big-box bookstores not as an abstract concept but as particular institutions embedded in both time and space?" (56)

"What distinguished middle-brow goods from other cultural goods was their unique blend of commerce and culture, their linking of mass-produced consumer goods to possibilities for learning and social advancement -- hitherto the provenance of high cultural forms and institutions." (57)

"Critics have tended to disparage those who compare bookselling to large-scale food selling.  As /You've Got Mail/ demonstrated, books are supposed to be treated as sacred artifacts, not as bulk merchandise.  To treat them otherwise is to fall prey to the crass trifecta of volume, efficiency, and commercialism.  What Bowlby suggests, however, is a much closer kinship between these two seemingly antithetical domains." (58)

"The combination of industrial production, middlebrow cultural dispositions, and the move toward mass higher education helped give rise to the idea of large-scale retail bookselling in the United States." (59)

"Efforts to resist the building of the shopping center were equally complex.  Protesters certainly responded to real concerns -- especially environmental ones -- about the mall's location and construction.  By the same token, the desire to resist the spread of national chains in the area, particularly among some Chapel Hill residents, could also be construed as an indirect way of preserving the area's existing distribution of wealth and racial privilege." (77)

"Why do certain communities have the privilege of /not/ opening big-box bookstores?  Under what historical conditions do communities choose to accept or reject those stores?" (77)

"The success of big-box bookstores isn't reducible to profit-obsessed corporations figuring out how to sell massive quantities of dreck to unwitting consumers.  These stores are also part and parcel of a larger historical project to democratize American education and culture -- despite how imperfectly and inconsistently that process has worked itself out and the fact that this project may now be coming apart at the seams." (78)

"Ultimately, these destination bookstores throw into relief the extent to which the book industry has tended to undersell itself and its wares.  Many publishes [sic] and booksellers have persisted in the belief that books ought to sell primarily on the basis of the qualities particular to individual titles, and that relying on exogenous factors to move them somehow diminishes the worth of these goods." (78-79)


3.  Bringing Bookland Online

on Jeff Bezos as super-genius inventor of Amazon: "Without denying that he's a consequential figure, I want to craft an alternative fable about the origins and effects of online bookselling.  Critical-technology scholars have rightly questioned the propensity among professional and lay historians to champion 'great men' and 'big ideas'... such a narrow focus tends to obscure the contingent array of social, economic, and material forces leading to the emergence (rather than the invention) of particular technical devices." (82)

"Integral to this process, I feel, is distribution.  Developments in this perhaps more arcane aspect of the circuit of culture have paralleled transformations in the more closely scrutinized domains of book production and consumption.  These developments include intensive and scrupulous sorting, coding, and inventory-control schemes and their union with computer/database technologies, without which the mass production of printed books, the modern book industry, and large-scale bookselling would have been neither thinkable nor practicable." (82)

"an enactment of what Michael Denning calls 'a labor theory of culture' intent on 'reminding us that the apparent confrontation between cultural commodities and cultural consumers obscures that laborers in the culture industry'" (83)

"how living labor, the ISBN, and machine-readable bar codes combine in colossal warehouse/distribution facilities -- arguably the nerve centers of the book industry's operations -- as a way of drawing out some aspects of the labor politics of everyday book culture in the late age of print." (83)

"The book industry had, in a sense, become a victim of its own success.  Its capacity to produce books had grown so rapidly and to such a degree in the early twentieth century that it had lost touch with supply and demand -- if it ever had it to begin with." (84)

"miscommunication, conflicting information, and a lack of coordination among authors, agents, publishers, editors, advertisers, critics, librarians, booksellers, and readers coalesced at the point of book distribution." (88)

"Universal product coding, statistically based marketing, standardized book production, and the dream of 'frictionless' commerce may be completely obvious aspects of the book industry today.  However, they were quite farfetched ideas at the time." (91)

"While the book industry might be faulted for the awkward missteps it still occasionally makes with respect to marketing and sales, like the auto parts industry it was among the very first to have agreed on and made use of a universal merchandise-coding system -- the International Standard Book Number (ISBN)." (92)

"the ISBN isn't merely a glorified stock number.  Rather, it's a carefully conceived, highly significant, and mathematically exact /code/ that contains detailed information about the identity of each book." (93)

"Bar codes and ISBNs stand in, albeit indirectly, for the people and labor power necessary to deliver this as well as other books to you." (99)

"When the Bookland EAN bar-coding system first came online in 1987, an anonymous 'top-ten New York publisher' had such high expectations that it would greatly expedite order and returns processing that it reportedly planned to lay off 75 percent of its warehouse staff.... Bookland EAN's implementation not only created new efficiency standards in the book industry but also provided incentives to downsize the labor force working behind the scenes in distribution." (100)

"Just as bar codes and EANs obscure a panoply of material and socioeconomic relations, so, too, do Web sites.  In the case of electronic commerce, pages and links constantly refer back to themselves and rarely point elsewhere.  Yet it's precisely this elsewhere that's so vital not only to the Internet's continued functioning but also to the success of electronic commerce." (101)

"at first glance ISBNs and EAN bar codes may seem innocuous.... However, as they've been implemented in capitalist production, distribution, exchange, and consumption, these seemingly unremarkable symbols have played a remarkable role in the processes whereby books have been transformed into ubiquitous commodities." (108)


4.  Literature as Life on Oprah's Book Club

"the book club's success hasn't insulated it from controversy.  Its unusually high profile likely has attracted and intensified debates over the cultural value of certain kinds of books and reading practices." (112)

"At stake here is nothing less than who reads what, when, where, how, why, and with whom -- and, just as important, who's empowered to make those decisions.  Also at stake, clearly, is the relationship between printed books and television, not to mention a series of normative assumptions underlying each medium's presumed moral worth.  Finally, in addition to these considerations is the thorny issue of culture's involvement with commerce... one whose complexity is here compounded by the political economy of celebrity." (112)

"the club has managed to articulate a sophisticated, albeit practicable, vision for books and book reading that's both grounded in and directly confronts everyday life's multitudinous demands, especially those traditionally associated with women." (112)

"in this chapter I part company with much of the existing literature on Oprah's Book Club, which has tended to measure the club's success or failure based on the normative standard of a collegiate literary education." (113)

"while the book club's success definitely has something to do with Winfrey's personality and opinion leadership, at least as important are its branding strategies and the ways in which it exploits the idiosyncrasies of contemporary TV programming." (113)

chapter charts "the norms, rules, and procedures through which the book club has articulated a unique economy of bibliographic value centered on everyday life." (113)

Oprahfication: "a perceived excess of emotionality; the popularization of suffering, public confession, therapy, and self-help; the privileging of image over depth; a lack of intellectualism; and, more generally, the debasement of culture.  Criticisms of the book club epitomize these sorts of critiques since its success would appear to mark nothing less than the Oprahfication of literacy within and beyond the United States." (114)

importance of "the programming and communication strategies whereby Winfrey and her producers prepare viewers at home to commit themselves to watching programs about books." (116)

"The club has succeeded, in part, because of the way in which it has (until recently) drawn near to the temporality -- the periodicity -- of everyday life, which proceeds on the basis of scheduled recurrences." (117)

"Understanding the 'talking life' of Oprah books also helps explain the book club's popularity and its politics, not to mention its willingness to listen closely to the voices of its participants." (117)

"Winfrey and her producers have been keenly sensitive to how the reading of specific books matches the tempo and variable rhythms of women's lives rather than placing the burden on them to adjust their schedules to accommodate specific reading assignments." (119)

"What this amounts to, essentially, is the difference between marketing a book to a particular segment of the reading public (a preferred strategy of the book industry) and finding ways to help any single book, as well as books in general, achieve a fit with living, breathing human beings in their daily lives." (120)

"the producers of /The Oprah Winfrey Show/ have demonstrated remarkable sensitivity to the range of reading abilities of both actual and potential club members." (122)

"reading on Oprah's Book Club doesn't connote the act of humbling oneself before the 'genius' of an intractable book as it might in a more traditional context of literary instruction.  Rather, it connotes, on the one hand, doing one's best to engage with challenging books and, on the other, recognizing that one's dissatisfaction with specific selections stems not from any personal intellectual defect but rather from Winfrey and her producers' having failed to choose a book that meets the needs, tastes, and desires of the club's members.  Reading should offer a trajectory to challenge, in other words, but shouldn't simply be a challenge in and of itself." (123)

"the book club's spirit of inclusiveness.  It welcomes prolific, seasoned readers with the same heartfelt 'hello' as it does newcomers.  This commitment, however, shouldn't be mistaken for a facile pluralism or a sense in which anything goes and nothing in particular is valued.  The book club's express openness to newer or more hesitant readers and the selections best suited to them is ultimately grounded in an ethic of challenging them to become involved in lengthier and more difficult texts in the long term." (124)

"How has Oprah's Book Club helped connect the /content/ of specific book club selections to the lives of women?  How have women made use of what these books have to say?  What, if anything, has their content helped women achieve?" (125)

"actuality often seems to trump the designation of specific books as fiction in the book club's routine patterns of conversation.  Fiction, in effect, falls out, leaving 'truth' as the overarching framework according to which club members are encouraged to approach and make sense of any and all titles." (127)

"the club demonstrates how women can carve out a safe harbor of sorts for themselves, one adjacent to but ultimately distinct from everyday life's repetitive routines." (128)

"the book club's ethico-aesthetic imperative to connect literature and life." (130)

"the whole Franzen-book club meltdown might have exposed the arbitrariness of value hierarchies, but it also reinforced how distinctions -- between low and high art, women and men, TV and books, corporate and independent media production -- are anything but meaningless in the late age of print." (133)

"The club's success and appeal aren't mere symptoms of the triumph of sentimentality in the book world, much less that of pop psychology; nor are they evidence of the 'dumbing down' of American culture, a claim Todd Gitlin has levied against trade fiction in general.  The popularity of Oprah's Book Club underscores the fact that readers might well be buying books in larger quantities if only authors, publishers, critics, and booksellers communicated more effectively not only in terms of highlighting specific titles but also in achieving a better fit with readers' experiences, needs, and daily routines." (133)

"Franzen's misdeeds had resulted in his becoming the only Oprah author ever to have his invitation to appear on the show withdrawn.  Why, then, did she invite Frey not once but twice to discuss /A Million Little Pieces/?.... Surely timing played a role in how Winfrey and her producers managed the fallout from each scandal.  Still, their markedly different responses to Franzen (shunning) and Frey (confrontation) suggest that more was at stake than mere timing.  The book club could ignore Franzen precisely because the trope around which so much of the controversy had turned -- the distinction between high and low culture -- was more or less irrelevant to the book club's worldview and ways of operating.  Responding at length would have been tantamount to validating what are, in effect, exogenous categories.  Indeed, this would explain why Winfrey, when asked about the controversy four years later, responded by saying that Franzen was 'not even a blip on the radar screen of my life.'
      In Frey's case, however, his fabrications contravened what is probably /the/ core value of Oprah's Book Club: the grounding of books in actual events.  Rather than reinforcing the intimate connection between literature and life, as almost all previous book club selections had been made to do, /A Million Little Pieces/ embodied the possibility of a disconnect." (136)

"The book club's success has also challenged what many presume to be the agonistic relationship that books and TV seem to share." (138)

"The book club's authority, moreover, has accrued from its pragmatic disposition toward books and reading -- embodied in the clever and diffuse forms of social pedagogy by which it engages both actual and potential readers at the level of the everyday." (138)

"The book club's success certainly owes a great deal to the unique ways in which it's helped imbue books with a vital 'talking life.' Another key to its success has been its remarkable willingness to listen." (138)

"this ethic of active listening underscores the degree to which people's everyday lives and their actual concerns form a creative basis for the book club's ways of operating." (139)

"Since its inception the book club has engaged in copious amounts of creative work, fashioning a unique set of standards and protocols by which to assess a given book's worth.  Life, actuality, a dialectic with the everyday -- these form the crux of its evaluative framework.  Part of the reason why the book club has been misunderstood by some is precisely the groundedness of these categories in the exigencies of everyday life -- indeed, in the facticity of everyday life itself." (139)

"Ultimately, identifying good books is less important for Oprah's Book Club than finding books that /fit/ -- an intractable alchemy that's vexed the book industry for a century." (139)


5.  Harry Potter and the Culture of the Copy

"Harry Potter proliferates -- often in ways exceeding the control of his creators and rights holders." (141)

"the painstaking efforts by Rowling and her associates to control exactly when, where, how, and among whom the Potter books circulate, coupled with the often punitive measures they exact on those who deviate from their wishes, constitute a story almost as spellbinding as the Potter books themselves." (142)

"Of course, it's one thing for three more or less like-minded publishers to agree to abide by a global lay-down date.  Getting all those involved to acquiesce -- from printers to shippers, warehousers, wholesalers, and retailers -- in moving a popular book like Harry Potter to market is another matter entirely." (146)

"Everyone was considered a potential thief -- at least from Scholastic's viewpoint.  Consequently no one could be trusted to preserve the book's secrets without a certain modicum of compulsion." (147)

"In helping to secure Harry Potter, in effect fans have been laboring to produce the very conditions of scarcity that, from an economic standpoint, might well be contrary to their own interests." (157)

"As Adrian Johns, Susan Stewart, and Siva Vaidhyanathan have shown, fakery, dissimulation, and liberal amounts of borrowing -- along with practices that many would decry as publishing piracy and textual corruption -- have been the custom rather than the exception during the period of mechanically and electronically reproduced books." (158-59)

"an epistemological proclivity prevalent in Western philosophy (at least since Plato) to see the world in terms of originals and copies... a flaw inherent in the English language, which provides a rich vocabulary for differentiating so-called real objects from fakes, but which is less helpful in positing a world populated by, and in differentiating only among, fakes." (167)

"Western discourses about publishing and other forms of piracy often fail to account for the vast gray market in cultural goods in which fakes, frauds, and illicit editions blend in easily with the 'real thing' and generally above-board business practices." (169)

"mainstream Western discourses about publishing piracy tend to be profoundly amnesiac.  They almost unilaterally sidestep the reprehensible acts that have helped lead, either directly or indirectly, to the formation of what Wang calls a global 'shadow economy.'" (169)

"Control monitors and regulates, permits and forbids, legitimates and condemns. Its purpose is to confront and exploit the capacity of specific artifacts to move and to permute.  Accordingly, it forms a crucial locus of power for those engaged in the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of books." (172)

"the way in which the industry simultaneously manufactures scarcity in order to regulate demand" (172)

"the value of the [Harry Potter] series lies in the many opportunities it affords to glimpse the growing entanglement of circulation, transfiguration, and control, and, more specifically, emerging values and practices that may be becoming normalized in the book industry at large." (173)

"The point of all of these efforts to map instances of Potter book piracy is not simply to valorize these deeds as heroic acts of resistance.  Rather, it is to identify some of the conditions under which people are willing to risk fines, imprisonment, public humiliation, and other forms of punishment for the sake of writing, manufacturing, disseminating, reading, and otherwise consuming books -- objects that at some level they feel are vital to their well-being." (173)


Conclusion: From Consumerism to Control

"The late age of print hardly portends cultural homogeneity,the end of printed books, or the complete upending of literary authority, though more modes changes in these and other spheres undoubtedly have occurred and will continue to do so." (175)

"consumer capitalism isn't simply a mode of production significantly driven by, and whose well-being largely depends on, the conspicuous consumption of mass produced commodities.  While it would be ludicrous to suggest that it hasn't been successful at exploiting consumeristic desires, in the end we're more than one-dimensional people or mere cogs in the system.  Consumer capitalism repeatedly produces repeated things, and while these objects can and do foster a strong sense of routine, they also serve as common resources by means of which individuals and groups can reshape their lives.... To consume isn't simply to use up, in other words, but to make do in unique and unexpected ways." (178-79)

"'neoliberal governmentality.' The phrase refers to a particular form of post-welfare politics in which the state outsources the responsibility of ensuring the population's well-being to individuals, who are expected to look after themselves.  It further refers to the subordination of state power to the dictates of the marketplace, so that solutions to 'political' problems are increasingly posed in market terms." (184)

"politics in the late age of print must do more than just short-circuit certain aspects of a technical-legal system.  It must also attempt to restore a sense of the choices that would -- or /should/ -- otherwise be available to us... 'hacking' is an apt metaphor to describe this type of political practice.... Hacking attempts to actualize absent alternatives, effectively writing them (back) into the realm of everyday existence." (186)
