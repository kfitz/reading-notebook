Virilio, Paul. The Vision Machine. Trans. Julie Rose. Bloomington: Indiana University Press/British Film Institute, 1994.

1.  A Topographical Amnesia

Rodin on failures of photography (i.e. mechanically-assisted vision) to create motion, and thus time, and thus the real

film and artificial memory

undermining of the topographical nature of memory via “visual prostheses” (Virilio 4); ‘memory palace’ mode of remembering no longer functional [but wouldn’t it be more accurate to suggest that the topographical had already been undermined by the typographical, and that the latter is confronted by the mechanical image?  somehow, typography gets subsumed into the mechanical image]

compression of space via visual technologies; compression of time; ease of forgetting

“With the proliferation of visual and audiovisual prostheses and unrestrained use of instantaneous-transmission equipment from earliest childhood onwards, we now routinely see the encoding of increasingly elaborate mental images together with a steady decline in retention rates and recall.  In other words we are looking at the rapid collapse of mnemonic consolidation.” (Virilio 6-7)

“Teachers have been saying for a long time now that the last few generations have great difficulty understanding what they read because they are incapable of re-presenting it to themselves…. For them, words have in the end lost their ability to come alive, since images, more rapidly perceived, were supposed to replace words according to the photographers, the silent film-makers, the propagandists and advertisers of the early twentieth century.  Now there is no longer anything to replace, and the number of visually illiterate and dyslexic keeps multiplying.” (Virilio 8, ellipsis in original)

damage to vision caused by artificial light; phatic image not just a matter of focusing but of “ever-brighter illumination” (Virilio 14)

2.  Less Than an Image

Nièpce and heliography; supernatural nature of light

compression and elimination of time in photography

opposition between thinking of vision as illusion and Marxist-materialist realism — anti-aesthetic movement coincides with rise of documentary

3.  Public Image

secret police as means of “illuminating” the private sphere in the same way as the public sphere

French Revolution’s obsession with lighting

investigators and journalists both aiming to enlighten

experiments of painters in creating vision machines prior to photography:  giganticism, panoramas, dioramas

“The introduction of fingerprints as proof of criminal law marks the decline of the story, of the eye-witness account and the descriptive model, once the basis of every investigation and crucial to writes of previous centuries.” (Virilio 42) — replacing of narrative evidence with recorded visual evidence

“the birth of hyper-realism in legal and police representation” (Virilio 44)

4.  Candid Camera

surveillance videos:  “This solemn farewell to the man behind the camera, the complete evaporation of visual subjectivity into an ambient technical effect, a sort of permanent pancinema which, unbeknown to us, turns our most ordinary acts into movie action, into new visual material, undaunted, undifferentiated vision-fodder, is not so much, as we have seen, the end of an art[....]  It is the absolute culmination of the inexorable march of progress of representational technologies, of their military, scientific and investigative instrumentalisation over the centuries.” (Virilio 47)

5.  The Vision Machine

“Now that they are preparing the way for the automation of perception, for the innovation of artificial vision, delegating the analysis of objective reality to a machine, it might be appropriate to have another look at the nature of the virtual image.” (Virilio 59)

relationship between mental images and material images; digital imagery and the “fusion/confusion” (Virilio 60) of the factual and the virtual

inversion of perception in the advertising image:  the image perceives you

logistics of the image develops historically:  “The age of the image’s formal logic was the age of painting, engraving and etching, architecture; it ended with the eighteenth century.  The age of dialectic logic is the age of photography and film or, if you like, the frame of the nineteenth century.  The age of paradoxical logic begins with the invention of video recording, holography and computer graphics…as though, at the close of the twentieth century, the end of modernity were itself marked by the end of a logic of public representation.” (Virilio 63, ellipsis in original)

“In the age of ‘generalised simulation’ of military missions (ground, navy or air) we thus land smack bang in the middle of the age of total dissimulation — a war of images and sounds, tending to take over from the missile war of the nuclear deterrence arsenal.” (Virilio 69)

interconnections of optics and kinematics
