"Textual, visual, graphic, navigational, and multimedia artifacts that are geographically dispersed in their original form can be aggregated in a single space for study and use, manipulated in ways that traditional means of access don't permit. The telecommunications aspect of new media allows creation of an inter-subjective, social space of shared use and exchange. Arguably, this latter is an extension of the social space of traditional scholarly or communicative exchange mainly by the change in rate, the immediacy, capacity to engage simultaneously in shared tasks or common projects."

"A book (whether thought of as a text or a physical object) is not an inert thing that exists in advance of interaction, rather it is produced new by the activity of each reading."

"Information, as Paul Duguid and John Seely Brown so clearly pointed out, gains its value through social use, not through inherent or abstract properties. The virtual e-space we envision takes all of these features, themselves present in many aspects of the traditional codex, but often difficult to grasp clearly, and makes them evident. All those traces of reading, of exchange, or of new arrangements and relations of documents, or expressions of the shared and social conditions in which a text is produced, altered, received can be made evident within an electronic space."
