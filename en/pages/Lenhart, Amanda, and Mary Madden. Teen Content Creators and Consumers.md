Lenhart, Amanda, and Mary Madden.  "Teen Content Creators and Consumers."  2 November 2005.  Pew Internet and American Life Project.  <http://www.pewinternet.org/2005/11/02/teen-content-creators-and-consumers/>


major findings:

-- "More than half of online teens are Content Creators" (i)

"Some 57% of online teens create content for the internet. That amounts to half of all teens ages 12-17, or about 12 million youth. These Content Creators report having done one or more of the following activities: create a blog; create or work on a personal webpage; create or work on a webpage for school, a friend, or an organization; share original content such as artwork, photos, stories, or videos online; or remix content found online into a new creation" (i)

-- "19% of online teens keep a blog and 38% read them" (i)

"7% of adult internet users say they have created their own blog and 27% of online adults say they read blogs. (Note: Data for adult blog readers comes from the May-June 2005 Pew Internet Project Tracking Survey.)" (i)

-- "Older girls lead the blogging activity among teens" (ii)

"Older girls ages 15-17 are the most likely to blog; 25% of online girls in this age group keep a blog, compared with 15% of older boys who are online. About 18% of younger teens of both sexes blog" (ii)

-- "Teen bloggers are tech-savvy and heavy internet users" (ii)

"Bloggers and to a lesser extent teens who read blogs are a particularly tech-savvy group of internet users.... Bloggers are more likely than non-bloggers to engage in everyday online activities such as getting news, using IM or making online purchases, but content creating and sharing activities are the areas where bloggers are far ahead of non-bloggers" (ii)


"one-third (33%) of online teens report sharing their own
artwork, photos, stories, or videos with others via the internet" (2)

-- demographics of these statistics do not include data about race; however -- very interestingly! -- there seems to be an inverse relationship between family income and the frequency of sharing self-created content:  36% of those with family incomes of less than $30K report sharing self-created content, as compared with 30% of those with incomes of $75K or more  (see below, however; blog-reading is more directly tied to SES)

"As with other online communication activities, older girls again lead the charge into blogging in the teen cohort" (4)

"Among teens who read blogs there are significant demographic differences from the overall online teen population. Teens from households with higher incomes ($50,000 and up) and higher levels of parental education are more likely to read blogs than teens from low socioeconomic status homes. About 42% of teens in households earning more than $50,000 annually report reading the blogs of others, compared with less than a third (30%) of teens from lower income households" (6)

"Girls are more likely than boys of similar ages to read the blogs of others. More than half (53%) of girls ages 15 to 17 read blogs, compared with 34% of boys in that age group" (6)

"While public discussion has raged about whether blogs constitute legitimate journalism or are a reliable source of information, for teens, blogs are much more about the maintenance and extension of personal relationships. When teens do read blogs, they mainly read the blogs of people they know. About 62% of blog-reading teens say they only read the blogs of people they know. The remaining group (36%) reports reading the blogs of both people they know and people they have never met. A mere 2% report only reading the blogs of people they do not know" (8)
