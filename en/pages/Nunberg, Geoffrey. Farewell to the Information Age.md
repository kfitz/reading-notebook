"the first sort of error is in seeing the future as being insufficiently like the present, and that is relatively easy to correct for; you just imagine the future furnished like the room you are in, whereas the second sort of error involves seeing the future as insufficiently different from the present, and this we can correct for only by a determined act of imagination" (Nunberg 104)

"there is nothing in the economics of publishing as a whole or the body of practice surrounding the use of the printed book that militates for its disappearance, even over the long term.  And while it is certain that many forms and genres will migrate in part or in whole to an electronic mode of existence over the coming years, there are numerous other printed genres that stand to benefit from the new technologies, whether in the form of electronic text preparation, demand printing, Web advertising, or, what may be most important, the computerized inventory systems that have made possible new types of retail distribution that have vastly extended general public access to texts over the past five years in ways that are arguably more significant than the effects of electronic media.  There will be a digital revolution, but the printed book will be an important participant in it." (Nunberg 104)

"When theorists talk about the power of the new media to make everyone an author, for example, or to provide everyone with universal access to potential audiences of millions of readers, they invoke a notion of authorship and a model of access that are more appropriate to traditional print media than to electronic communication.  What is an author, after all, if the new media no longer support the legal status or institutional privileges that have traditionally defined that role?" (Nunberg 105)

"The suppression of the subject in the language of information corresponds to the suppression of explicit authorship in the document, in both its phenomenal and institutional guises.  With the emergence of the informational genres, the writer of a news story no longer appears either as one of its characters or, increasingly, in the byline; it is the institution or the form itself that speaks.  Historically, this sort of shift in authority accompanied the emergence and development of the informational genres." (Nunberg 120-21)

"Walter Benjamin observed sixty years ago that with the extension of the press and the multiplication of organs, 'an increasing number of readers became writers... Today there is hardly a gainfully employed European who could not, on principle, fin an opportunity to publish somewhere or other comments on his work, grievances, documentary reports, or that sort of thing.'  And we can find reports to the same effect in Carlyle in the nineteenth century and Johnson in the eighteenth.  But while the absolute number of writers and documents has been steadily growing, the *proportion* of writers to reader has remained relatively constant or may even have declined over the centuries, along with the circulation of the average published document." (Nunberg 125)

"On the Web, that is, you can never have the kind of experience that you can have with the informational genres of print, the experience of interpreting a text simply *as* a newspaper or encyclopedia article without attending to its author, its publisher, or the reliability of its recommender.  We read Web documents, that is, not as information but as intelligence, which requires an explicit warrant of one form or another." (Nunberg 127-28)

"One of the most pervasive features of these media is how closely they seem to reproduce the conditions of discourse of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the sense of the public was mediated through a series of transitive personal relationships -- the friends of one's friends, and so one -- and anchored in the immediate connections of clubs, coffee-houses, salons, and the rest.... It may be true that most participants in Net colloquy will never actually meet each other individually, or even have direct electronic contact, but unlike the members of nations, social classes, or even ethnicities, each of them is immediately and personally accessible to any other." (Nunberg 130)
