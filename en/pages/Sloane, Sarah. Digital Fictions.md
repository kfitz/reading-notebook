connections of the digital to the material

“secondary corporeality” used to describe the state of the virtual body; “the image of bodies scripted and inscribed in digital fictions” (5)

redefines the “material” not as the physical or tangible but as the fabric out of which representations (including the virtual) are constructed

attempting in this fashion to undermine the dichotomy between the material and the virtual, separating materiality from the real

storytelling and the ways its rhetoric reveals the body

the problem of ‘naturalization’ – making visible the technologies of representation

not terribly helpful, I think; very computers and composition, and not well-written
