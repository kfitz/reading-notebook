Armstrong, Nancy. How Novels Think: The Limits of British Individualism From 1719-1900. New York: Columbia University Press, 2006.


"According to eighteenth-century epistemology and moral philosophy, the modern subject came into being as it took in sensations from the outside world and, of that material, composed first the ideas and then the judgment and moral sense that gave it a self-enclosed and internally coherent identity" (Armstrong 1)

"This book argues that the history of the novel and the history of the modern subject are, quite literally, one and the same.  The British novel provides the test case.  It came into being, I believe, as writers sought to formulate a kind of subject that had not yet existed in writing.  Once formulated in fiction, however, this subject proved uniquely capable of reproducing itself not only in authors but also in readers, in other novels, and across British culture in law, medicine, moral and political philosophy, biography, history, and other forms of writing that took the individual as their most basic unit.  Simply put, this class- and culture-specific subject is what we mean by 'the individual.'  To produce an individual, novels had to think as if there already were one, that such an individual was not only the narrating subject and source of writing but also the object of narration and referent of writing" (Armstrong 3)

"not all fictional characters could become the protagonists of a novel.  In order to qualify, a character had to harbor an acute dissatisfaction with his or her assigned position in the social world and feel compelled to find a better one" (Armstrong 4)

"Novelists had to figure out the rhetorical means of generating dissatisfaction with the available social possibilities before they could create a human subject with the restlessness to grow -- over time and in successive stages -- both more complete as an individual and more worthy in social terms" (Armstrong 4)

"the picaresque form, which allows protagonists to move out of the hierarchy that initially defines them and into a new field of social possibilities, where they can find a place that accommodates their needs and abilities.  Of course, only individuals whose wit, will, ability, and desire exceed those appropriate to the position to which they were born can achieve such mobility" (Armstrong 5)

of Pamela:  "It is literacy alone that transforms her from an object he can forcibly possess into a self-possessed subject who can consent to his offer of marriage.  Embodying the core fantasy of the early novel -- that writing makes the individual -- Pamela writes herself into existence as the wife of a wealthy landowner.  Looking back from Pamela at Crusoe and Moll, we can see that their extraordinary adventures could have done little to make them exemplary had they not possessed the means of authoring their respective stories.  They were in this sense alone truly exceptional.  Each could inscribe him or herself in writing as an object, or body, separate and apart from the subject that inhabited that body, and put that body through a sequence of moves to enhance its social value" (Armstrong 5-6)

"If the novels of Jane Austen (1811-18) represent the perfect synthesis of desiring individual and self-governing citizen, they also mark the moment when that synthesis crumbled under the threat of social rebellion" (Armstrong 6)

"Austen's novels mark the simultaneous modernization of the individual and maturation of the novel" (Armstrong 7)

Austen's "magical reconciliation of individual demands with those of the larger community" (Armstrong 7)

Scott's _Waverly_ and Shelley's _Frankenstein_ also focus on "defending the norms of citizenship from the encroachments of individual desire" (Armstrong 7)

"education in both _Waverly_ and _Frankenstein_ cultivates forms of individualism so extravagant that they must be destroyed in the name of humanity.... Both works consequently bear the scars of their moment in history, as they transforms extraordinary forms of individualism into subhuman forms, a threat at once to family and nation" (Armstrong 7)

"Victorian novels make the turn against expressive individualism a mandatory component of the subject's growth and development.  To create an individual, however, still requires the novel to offer an interiority in excess of the social position that the individual is supposed to occupy" (Armstrong 8)

"To become an individual under these circumstances, the subject must still surmount the limits of an assigned social position.  This is only the first step on the path to individuality, however, and a false step at that.... individualism is by nature aggressive and expresses itself in cruelty toward the very people whom one should cherish" (Armstrong 8)

"I plan to read the sequence of transformations constituting such novels as a series of displacements driven not by the individual's restless energy so much as by an imperative to close the gap between self and social position without disturbing what appears to be a dangerously fragile social order.  The result is a radical reformulation of the individual as a subject layered by successive displacements.  This subject is necessarily divided against itself, as the desire essential to that subject's growth and development comes to pose a threat to its individuality" (Armstrong 8)

"individuality depends on how he or she chooses to displace what is a fundamentally asocial desire onto a socially appropriate object" (Armstrong 8)

"Writing during the early twentieth century alongside the modernists, Freud set out to discover inside the individual many of the same turns of cultural thought that at once brought the individual into being and limited its existence in the interest of a community composed of similar subject"  (Armstrong 9)

"In so relocating the outside on the inside, it is fair to say, Freud not only transformed the individual from a novel-made discourse into a self-perpetuating one; he also ensured that the subject's personal history would reproduce that of the novel.  With Freud, therefore, the individual comes, in theory, to recapitulate the history of the novel, as it rethought its youthful aggression in light of the increasing responsibilities of adulthood and empire"  (Armstrong 9)

"wherever novels are written and read they are, in all likelihood, reproducing the modern individual in both fiction and fact"  (Armstrong 9)

"I cannot quite believe that any novel can reach in and modify the ideological core of the genre and still remain a novel....  What I mean by 'the ideological core' is not the British, the European, or even the Western features of the novel but the presupposition that novels think like individuals about the difficulties of fulfilling oneself as an individual under specific cultural historical conditions" (Armstrong 10)

"new varieties of novel cannot help taking up the project of universalizing the individual subject.  That, simply put, is what novels do"  (Armstrong 10)

"I seriously doubt that individualism could have taken shape and spread throughout the West as fast and decisively as it did unless and until the novel had transformed the concept into narrative form.... What we now call 'the novel' won its title in a field of argumentation as it figured out how to adjust to, incorporate, and abject competing ways of thinking about the individual.  Indeed, I must insist, the novel represented such opposition in terms that ensured the hegemony of its kind of individual" (Armstrong 10)

"I will go so far as to attribute the longevity of liberal individualism to its skill at defending the very concept of the individual against assaults on its universality that came from other modes of subject formation" (Armstrong 11)

"The self-enclosure of the individual could be challenged on grounds that it was after all composed of information taken into the mind through the portals of the senses" (Armstrong 11)

"But if, by the same token, the knowledge one acquires -- knowledge that the protagonist of _Robinson Crusoe_ considers a major source of his self-worth -- comes from outside, then who is to say that the subject is not permeable to sensations already packaged as ideas, invested with value, and charged with feeling?  Who is to say that either our ideas or feelings are in fact our own?" (Armstrong 12)

"The claim that feelings come from within the individual inevitably gives rise to the question of how individuals share their feelings with one another" (Armstrong 12)

on Rousseau:  "one individual comes to know how another feels by witnessing the spectacle of the other's suffering" (Armstrong 13)

"As individuals, in other words, we can never actually feel what another person feels except as 'something which, though weaker in degree, is not altogether unlike' those feelings" (Armstrong 13, quoting Adam Smith)

"Any way of thinking that opposes individualism, as I believe much of the literature of sensibility does, would therefore challenge the novelistic proposition that feelings well up from within the subject in response to sensations and acquire the form of ideas that enrich that subject's personal storehouse of knowledge... The novel could incorporate any number of sentimental arguments so long as they amplified the individual, rounding it out, so to speak, without eroding its self-enclosure" (Armstrong 16)

"Austen's heroines speak through objects and are granted subject status on the basis of what those objects say.  Used in this way, objects are no longer objects pure and simple but become part objects, tokens of individual interiority.  But whenever the emotional charge entering the individual from external objects through the senses overwhelm those genuine feelings that well up from within the individual, Austen's novels draw a line, as if to say 'sensibility, thou shalt go no farther'" (Armstrong 18)

"If we say that before Austen the eighteenth-century novel was no more a fully consolidated and naturalized entity than the individual but participated in a many-faceted debate about individualism and whether it was fact or fiction, then how to we read any novel as one and entire?" (Armstrong 18)

"These early-nineteenth-century canonizers established novels celebrating the individual as central to the tradition of the novel, as they repeatedly included certain novels front and center in their collections and commentaries" (Armstrong 21)

"The tradition of the eighteenth-century novel consequently came to resemble the individual produced by the novels composing that tradition, one compelled by its own energy repeatedly to exceed itself and grow as it absorbed new information and remodeled the world as well as the individual who encountered it" (Armstrong 22)

"The Victorian novel was in this sense dependent on disruptions of the normative reality.  Whenever they recast the subject's accumulation of knowledge as a process of detection, such novels were acknowledging their ties not only to the Enlightenment subject but also to the gothic sensibility" (Armstrong 22)

"In the last decades of the century, however, fiction [that?] spelled out the conflict between the individual and some form of collectivity that obliterated individualism became novels many times over and to the delight of readers" (Armstrong 23)

"The figure of mass man loomed large as the means both of conceptualizing the populations accumulating within their empire and of posing a threat to modern individualism" (Armstrong 23)

"Mass man is distinguished by the fact that its psychic energy exceeds the sum total of individual desires composing such a group, were that group indeed composed of individuals.  In the late-nineteenth-century romance, something like this transindividual desire sends a current through the human aggregate, welding any and all individuals into a single body without regard for differences of race, gender, class, and nation" (Armstrong 24-25)

"It remains one of the more glaring contradictions of Western cultural history that at a time when individualism had clearly achieved hegemony within a nation intent on spreading itself around the globe, that model of individualism went on the defensive, as if to say that the modern individual could only define him- or herself as such in opposition to an engulfing otherness, or mass, that obliterated individuality....  We shall be able to abandon this defensive position, in my opinion, only when novels begin to think of a genuine alternative to the individual, one that does not inspire phobia and yet is grounded in the world we now inhabit" (Armstrong 25)
