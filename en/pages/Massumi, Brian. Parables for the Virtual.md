Massumi, Brian. Parables for the Virtual: Movement, Affect, Sensation. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002.


"Can we think a body without this: an intrinsic connection between movement and sensation whereby each immediately summons the other?" (Massumi 1)

"The project of this book is to explore the implications for cultural theory of this simply conceptual displacement:  body -- (movement/sensation) -- change." (Massumi 1)

"Earlier phenomenological investigations into the sensing body were largely left behind because they were difficult to reconcile with the new understandings of the structuring capacities of culture and their inseparability both from the exercise of power and the glimmers of counterpower incumbent in mediate living.  It was all about a subject without subjectivism:  a subject 'constructed' by external mechanisms.  'The Subject.'" (Massumi 2)

"'The Body.' What is it to The Subject?" (Massumi 2)

"The focus on the systemic had to be brought back down to earth in order to be able to integrate into the account the local cultural differences and the practices of resistance they may harbor.  The concept of 'positionality' was widely developed for this purpose." (Massumi 2)

"Is the body as linked to a particular subject position anything more than a local embodiment *of* ideology?  Where has the potential for change gone?" (Massumi 3)

"... the hope that movement, sensation, and qualities of experience couched in matter in its most literal sense (and sensing) might be culturally-theoretically thinkable, without falling into either the Scylla of naive realism or the Charybdis of subjectivism and without contradicting the very real insights of poststructuralist cultural theory concerning the coextensiveness of culture with the field of experience and of power with culture." (Massumi 4)

"Far from regaining a concreteness, to think the body in movement thus means accepting the paradox that there is an incorporeal dimension *of the body*.  Of it, but not it.  Real, material, but incorporeal.  Inseparable, coincident, but disjunct." (Massumi 5)

"When we think of space as 'extensive,' as being measurable, divisible, and composed of points plotting possible positions that objects may occupy, we are stopping the world in thought." (Massumi 6)

"positionality is an emergent quality of movement." (Massumi 8)

"Measurement stops the movement in thought, as it empties the air of weather, yielding space understood as a grid of determinate positions." (Massumi 10)

"The point is that the 'natural' and the 'cultural' feed forward and back into each other.  They relay each other to such an extent that the distinction cannot be maintained in any strict sense.  It is necessary to theorize a *nature-culture continuum*" (Massumi 11)

"Gender, race, and orientation are what Ian Hacking calls 'interactive kinds': logical categories that feed back into and transform the very reality they describe (and are themselves modified in return)." (Massumi 12)

"productivism" = "evolutionary constructivism"

"If you want to adopt a productivist approach, the techniques of critical thinking prized by the humanities are of limited value.... The balance has to shift to *affirmative* methods: techniques which embrace their own inventiveness and are not afraid to own up to the fact that they add (if so meagerly) to reality." (Massumi 12-13)

"sensation is never simple.  It is always doubled by the feeling of having a feeling.  It is self-referential" (Massumi 13)

"Given the touchiness surrounding the issue of thefts from science for the humanities, it is probably wise to say a word about it.  Defenders of the disciplinary purity of the sciences consider it shameless poaching.  I wholeheartedly agree.  It's not science anymore, they say, once those silly humanities people get their hands on it.  It's all 'wrong.'
     As well it should be.  Getting it 'right' could only mean one thing: applying the results of science to the humanities.  If carried out systematically, this simply annexes the target area to the sciences, in what amounts to a form of imperialist disciplinary aggression." (Massumi 19)

"The point, once again, is not to make the humanities scientific.  The point is to borrow from science in order to make a difference in the humanities.  But not only that... part of the idea is to put the humanities in a position of having continually to renegotiate their relations with the sciences -- and, in the process, to rearticulate what is unique to their own capacities (what manner of affects *they* can transmit)." (Massumi 20-21)
