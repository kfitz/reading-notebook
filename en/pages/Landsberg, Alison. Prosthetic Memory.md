Landsberg, Alison. Prosthetic Memory: The Transformation of American Remembrance in the Age of Mass Culture. New York: Columbia University Press, 2004.


"To what extent do modern technologies of mass culture, such as film, with their ability to transport individuals through time and space, function as technologies of memory? In what ways do these technologies of mass culture challenge the distinction between individual and collective memory?" (1)

"This new form of memory, which I call *prosthetic memory*, emerges at the interface between a person and a historical narrative about the past, at an experiential site such as a movie theater or museum." (2)

"cinema and other mass cultural technologies have the capacity to create shared social frameworks for people who inhabit, literally and figuratively, different social spaces, practices, and beliefs." (8)

"Nineteenth-century monuments produced memories that unified people across differences of class, ethnicity, gender, and region. But they did so by constructing a common national identity that was supposed to supersede these differences. By contrast, prosthetic memories do not erase differences or construct common origins." (9)

"prosthetic memory creates the conditions for ethical thinking precisely by encouraging people to feel connected to, while recognizing the alterity of, the 'other'." (9)

"Prosthetic memory enables people to take on memories of the past, even to identify with people from the past, but it also works to emphasize their position in the present even as they take on the past.... This form of memory thus challenges, or works against, the naturalizing, essentialist tendencies of identity politics." (22)

"Prosthetic memories... have a unique ability to generate empathy. Unlike sympathy, empathy does not depend on a 'natural' affinity, on some kind of essential underlying connection between two subjects. Empathy recognizes the alterity of identification and the necessity of negotiating distances and is therefore essential to any ethical relation to the other. A practice of empathy is an essential part of taking on prosthetic memories, of finding ways to inhabit other people's memories *as* other people's memories and thereby respecting and recognizing difference." (24)

"Sympathy, a feeling that arises out of simple identification, often takes the form of wallowing in someone else's pain. Although it presumes sameness between the sympathizer and her object, whether or not there is actually a 'sameness' between them, an actual shared experience, matters little, for in the act of sympathizing, one projects one's own feelings onto another. This act can be imperializing and colonizing, taking over, rather than making space for, the other person's feelings." (149)

"I do not mean for even a moment to suggest that there is anything *inherently* positive or progressive about this new form of memory. What I am emphasizing instead is the unique power of prosthetic memory to affect people both intellectually and emotionally, in ways that might ultimately change the way they think and how they act in the world. My call, therefore, is for intellectuals and educators to take seriously both the desire of people to be part of history and the potential of prosthetic memory to bring about social justice." (154)

"I am describing here a utopian dream, a dream in which ethics and politics converge." (155)
