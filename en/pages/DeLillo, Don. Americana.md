Part One

Pru:  “I didn’t know you went out with nignogs, David.” (DeLillo 5)

“The war was on television every night but we all went to the movies.  Soon most of the movies began to look alike and we went into dim rooms and turned on or off, or watched others turn on or off, or burned joss sticks and listened to tapes of near silence.  I brought my 16mm camera along.  It was a witty toy and everyone was delighted.” (DeLillo 5)

“Quincy was in rare form, telling a series of jokes about Polish janitors, Negro ministers, Jews in concentration camps and Italian women with hairy legs.  He battered his audience with shock and insult, challenging people to object.  Of course we were choking with laughter, trying to outdo each other in showing how enlightened we were.  It was meant to be a liberating ethnic experience.  If you were offended by such jokes in general, or sensitive to particular ones which slurred your own race or ancestry, you were not ready to be accepted into the mainstream.  B. G. Haines [the nignog], who was a professional model and one of the most beautiful women I have ever known, seemed to be enjoying Quincy’s routine.  She was one of four black people in the room — and the only American among them — and she apparently felt it was her diplomatic duty to laugh louder than anyone and Quincy’s most vicious color jokes.” (DeLillo 5-6)

“Physical identity meant a great deal to me when I was twenty-eight years old.  I had almost the same kind of relationship with my mirror that many of my contemporaries had with their analysts.” (DeLillo 11) — wholly visual relationship to the self

“When I was a teenager I saw Burt in From Here to Eternity.  He stood above Deborah Kerr on that Hawaiian beach and for the first time in my life I felt the true power of the image.  Burt was like a city in which we are all living.  He was that big.  Within the conflux of shadow and time, there was room for all of us and I knew I must extend myself until the molecules parted and I was spliced into the image.” (DeLillo 12-13) — connect to David’s “mating” with tv set

“It’s time now to run the film again.  I mean that quite literally, for I still have in my possession a movie made in those years, and many tapes as well.  There isn’t much to do on an island this remote and I can kill (or rather redistribute) a fair amount of time by listening to the soundtrack and taking yet another look at some of the footage.” (DeLillo 14)

“This was the first of the St. Augustines.  Previous memos had borne messages from Zwingli, Lévi-Strauss, Rilke, Chekhov, Tillich, William Blake, Charles Olson and a Kiowa chief named Satanta.  Naturally the person responsible for these messages became known throughout the company as the Mad Memo-Writer.  I never referred to him that way because it was much too obvious a name.  I called him Trotsky.” (DeLillo 21)

“There were times when I thought all of us at the network existed only on videotape.  Our words and actions seemed to have a disturbingly elapsed quality.  We had said and done all these things before and they had been frozen for a time, rolled up in little laboratory trays to await broadcast and rebroadcast when the proper time-slots were available.  And there was the feeling that somebody’s deadly pinky might nudge a button and we would all be erased forever.  Those moments in the washroom, with a dozen men sawing away at their teeth, were perhaps the worst times of all.  We seemed to be no more than electronic signals and we moved through time and space with the stutter and shadowed insanity of a TV commercial.” (DeLillo 23-24)

“perhaps in this city the crowd was essential to the individual; without it, he had nothing against which to scrape his anger, no echo for grief, and not the slightest proof that there were others more lonely than he.  It was just a passing thought.  I got home, turned on the TV, undressed, and got in the shower.” (DeLillo 29)

couples at the dance look “as if arranged for the whim of a camera” (DeLillo 30); “Once again, as on so many occasions in my life, I was stirred by the power of the image.” (DeLillo 31)

David begins in college to work in film; “The possibilities of film seemed unlimited.” (DeLillo 33)

David and Merry’s life as spectators at an endless series of films:  “Each movie we saw was the greatest.  Merry would talk about it constantly for two days and then forget it forever.” (DeLillo 35)

the marital movie:  “The movies were giving difficult meanings to some of the private moments of my life.” (DeLillo 35)

Merry’s filmicness, as “a sort of corporate unpredictability” (35); “It was all there but the soundtrack and I could imagine a series of cuts and slow dissolves working in Merry’s mind.” (DeLillo 36)

working at the network:  “I learned to distrust those superiors who encouraged independent thinking.  When you gave it to them, they returned it in the form of terror, for they knew that ideas, only that, could hasten their obsolescence.  Management asked for new ideas all the time; memos circulated down the echelons, requesting bold and challenging concepts.  But I learned that new ideas could finish you unless you wrapped them in a plastic bag.  I learned that most of the secretaries were more intelligent than most of the executives and that the executive secretaries were to be feared more than anyone.  I learned what closed doors meant and that friendship was not negotiable currency and how important it was to lie even when there was no need to lie.  Words and meanings were at odds.  Words did not say what was being said nor even its reverse.” (DeLillo 36)

“life with Merry went on the same way, a blend of jump-cuts and soft-focus tenderness.” (DeLillo 37)

“I realize there is nothing more dull than another man’s chronicle of infidelity” (DeLillo 37) — assumption of male reader

failure of marriage:  “Merry and I could not remember our lines” (DeLillo 38)

“I looked at the TV screen for a moment and then found myself in a chair about a foot away from the set, watching intently.  I could not tell what was happening on the screen and it didn’t seem to matter.  Sitting that close all I could perceive was that meshed effect, those stormy motes, but it drew me in and held me as if I were an integral part of the set, my molecules mating with those millions of dots.” (DeLillo 43)

“Soon I began to understand the attraction of pathological lying.  To construct one’s own reality, then bend it to an implausible extreme, was an adventure even more thrilling than the linguistic free falls of the network.” (DeLillo 58)

“The only problem I had was that my whole life was a lesson in the effect of echoes, that I was living in the third person.” (DeLillo 58)

thinks of falling asleep as “beginning to go to black, in network parlance” (DeLillo 60)

ratings on the “warcasts” have gone down; in a meeting, Weede Denney suggests a move to “live satellite pickup,” which Warburton dismisses as “ghoulish beyond belief”; Warburton’s opinion is stated because he “had assumed the position of tribal conscience.” (DeLillo 62)  Nevertheless, “Nobody ever paid the slightest attention to Warburton’s pleas on behalf of humanity and good taste but we all felt, I think, that he was indispensable.  He elevated our petty issues to a cosmological level and by so doing made it easier for us to ignore the whole thing on the grounds that we weren’t qualified to deal with such high moral questions.” (DeLillo 63)

debate about whether or not a toilet bowl can be shown:  “‘Why can’t we show the thing in use?’ Walter Faye said.  ‘Just once I’d like to see somebody on TV take a tremendous steaming piss.  It could even have dramatic justification.... I wouldn’t care where the camera was.  We could stay on his face.  The important thing is the sound.  If we could just get that sound on the airwaves, just once, I honestly think we could take credit for expanding the consciousness of our nation to some small degree.’
‘Yes,’ Weede Denney said. ‘It would be almost as good as Ruby shooting Oswald.’ ” (DeLillo 66)

“‘Did you hear?’ Jones said.  ‘Merrill hired a Negro.  Blaisdell met him yesterday.  Said he seems like a nice clean-cut guy.’
‘Let’s go look at him,’ Quincy said.” (DeLillo 75)

“‘I want to ask you something,” [Denney] said.  “It concerns a matter of some delicacy.  I understand you’re tuned in to many of the undercurrents.  What either of us says here mustn’t go any further than this office.  Is Reeves Chubb a homosexual?  You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to.’” (DeLillo 79)

“‘As you know, Dave, we hire people on the basis of ability alone.  This has always been the network’s policy.  Personally I have no interest in a man’s private life.  What a man does in his free time is no concern of mine, within reason....  But there’s another issue at stake here.  The State Department doesn’t want any queers working on the China thing.  Far be it from me to challenge the thinking of people whose most vital concern is our own national security...” (DeLillo 80)

“My father collected reels of TV commercials.  The basement of the house in Old Holly was full of these reels, carefully filed and cross-indexed as to length, type of product, audience recall, product identification and a number of other categories.” (DeLillo 84)

“It was snowing again and people moved head-down, clutching their hats, shouldering into the wind.  I walked across the wide gray lobby.  In a far corner there was an exhibit of prize-winning war photographs.  One of them was an immense color blow-up, about ten feet high and twenty feet wide.  In the center of the picture was a woman holding a dead child in her arms, and behind her and on either side were eight other children; some of them looked at the woman while others were smiling and waving, apparently at the camera.  A young man was down on one knee in the middle of the lobby, photographing the photograph.  I stood behind him for a moment and the effect was unforgettable.  Time and distance were annihilated and it seemed that the children were smiling and waving at him.  Such is the prestige of the camera, its almost religious authority, its hypnotic power to command reverence from subject and bystander alike, that I stood absolutely motionless until the young man snapped the picture.  It was as though I feared that any small movement on my part might distract one of those bandaged children and possibly ruin the photograph.” (DeLillo 86-87)

on Warren Beasley’s radio show, “Death Is Just Around the Corner”:  “‘Death’ had more than its share of freak-appeal and it probably attracted most of the area’s neo-Nazis, transsexuals, interplanetary travelers, coprophiles, whip and chain collectors, astral seers, blood-drinkers and morgue attendants — all the caffeine dregs of a century of national insomnia.” (DeLillo 94)

“I was drawn to Brand.  He represented the danger that was lacking in my life, real danger, not the plastic stuff available in great quantities at the network or the celluloid peril of those movie roles with which I challenged the premise of my marriage.” (DeLillo 114)

Sullivan’s rendition of the predictions of the old Oglala Sioux holy man:  “He said that all the new universities would consist of only one small room.  It would work this way.  At the beginning of each semester the entire student body — which would have to number at least five hundred thousand in order to give the computers enough to do — would assemble in a large open space in front of a TV camera.  They would be televised and put on videotape.  In a separate operation the instructors would also be videotaped, individually.  The two TV  sets would be placed in the single room which represented the university.  The room would be in a small blockhouse at the edge of a thirty-six-lane freeway; this proximity would help facilitate transmission of electronic equipment.  Oh, there might be some banners on the wall and maybe a plaque or two, but aside from these the only things in the room would be the TV sets.  At nine o’clock in the morning of the first day of classes, a computer would turn on the two televisions ets, which would be facing each other.  The videotape of the students would then watch the videotape of the instructors.  Eventually the system could be refined so that there would be only one university in the whole country.” (DeLillo 119-120)

Part Two

“The dream made no allowance for the truth beneath the symbols, for the interlinear notes, the presence of something black (and somehow very funny) at the mirror rim of one’s awareness.  This was difficult at times.  But as a body, and even later, quite a bit later, I believed all of it, the institutional messages, the psalms and placards, the pictures, the words.  Better living through chemistry.  The Sears, Roebuck catalog.  Aunt Jemima.  All the impulses of the media were fed into the circuitry of my dreams.  One thinks of echoes.  One things of an image made in the image and likeness of images.  It was that complex.” (DeLillo 130)

“We were a town then, American in our outlook, plain and meat-eating, relatively unhurried, willing to die for our country, or for photographs of our country.” (DeLillo 132)

“I pleased myself by thinking, as white men will do, that some Afro-instinct burned in an early part of my being.” (DeLillo 145)

of his college friend, Ken Wild:  “Both of us wrote poetry.  I enjoyed strangling the words and trying to get them on paper still living but when I failed to finish what I had planned to do, or even to begin it, I was less than seriously troubled.  After all I had my camera.” (DeLillo 145)

obsession with blackness:  “Everything begins in California.  It is like the hip lexicon of the ghetto; as soon as Madison Avenue breaks the code, Harlem devises a new one.  So with California and New York.” (DeLillo 150)

dad’s train attacked by Puerto Rican and black kids:  “Those little bastards.  What did we ever do to them?” (DeLillo 155)

“Numbers matter less now that the adding machines, the super-calculators, the numerical systems and sub-systems have been uninvented.” (DeLillo 159)

Jane’s class in “primitive religions” — a rendering of quaint superstition? (DeLillo 183)

Part Three

“‘Tell us about your novel,’ Sullivan said.
‘Writers never talk about work in progress,’ I said.  ‘Isn’t that right, Bobby?  It destroys the necessary tension.  If they talked about it, they wouldn’t have to write it anymore.  Essentially people write to break the tension.  Right, Brand?  If the creative tension is broken prematurely, the original motivation is lost.  I’m surprised to hear you ask a question like that, Sully.  You of all people.’
‘It’s about a man who turns into a woman,’ Brand said.  ‘He’s the former president of the United States.  He’s completed his two terms but he’s still very popular and he’s always speaking at important banquets.  At the same time he’s turning into a woman.  He’s beginning to grow breasts and his genitals are shrinking.  His voice is becoming high and faggy.  He wears a garter belt for the secret thrill it gives him.  He’s a WASP, the ex-president.  But de new president is black.  He’s patterned after Sonny Liston.  He’s very hip and magical.  He turns on every night and he’s making it with all the wives and daughters of the southern senators and even with some of the senators themselves.  It’ll be over a thousand pages long.  It’s called Coitus Interruptus.  The theme is whatever you want it to be because appearance is all that matters, man.  The whole country’s going to puke blood when they read it.’” (DeLillo 204-205)

power of the camera:  “That evening I got out my camera and went for a walk.  It was a 16mm Canon Scoopic, modified to work as a sync rig with my tape recorder, a late-model Nagra.  The camera didn’t have an interchangeable lens but it was light, easy to handle and went to work in a hurry.  Originally all I had wanted to do on the trip west was shoot some simple film, the white clapboard faces of Mennonite farmers, the spare Kansans in their churchgoing clothes.  But now my plans were a bit more ambitious, scaring me somewhat, at least in their unedited form.  I clutched the handgrip, rested the camera on my right shoulder and walked through the quiet streets.  Soon a small crowd was following me.” (DeLillo 210)

everyone who approaches either has a camera of their own they tell him about or asks him about the camera

on Austin Wakely:  “For the first time since I’d met him, I felt myself gaining the edge.  There would have to be no subtle bloodshed, no long campaign to dominate another individual.  I had the camera and that was enough.” (DeLillo 241)

pretending to film women in the supermarket parking lot; women waving at the camera:  “Maybe they sensed that they were waving at themselves, waving in the hope that someday if evidence is demanded of their passage through time, demanded by their own doubts, a moment might be recalled when they stood in a dazzling plaza in the sun and were registered on the transparent plastic ribbon; and thirty years away, on that day when proof is needed, ir could be hoped that their film is being projected on a screen somewhere, and there they stand, verified, in chemical reincarnation, waving at their own old age, smiling their reassurance to the decades, a race of eternal pilgrims in a marketplace in the dusty sunlight, seven arms extended in a fabulous salute to the forgetfulness of being.  What better proof (if proof is ever needed) that they have truly been alive?” (DeLillo 254)

“I could not help feeling that what I was discovering here was power of a sort.” (DeLillo 255)

David sees himself as a “child of Godard and Coca-Cola” (DeLillo 269)

in film:  asks Glenn Yost “What is there in that box?  Why is he watching?”; Glenn responds:  “The TV set is a package and it’s full of products”; the effect of the TV set is to move the individual “from first person consciousness to third person.  In this country there is a universal third person, the man we all want to be.  Advertising has discovered this man.” (DeLillo 270)

“‘What is the role of commercial television in the twentieth century and beyond?’
‘In my blackest moods I feel it spells chaos for all of us.’
‘How do you get over these moods?’ I said.
‘I take a mild and gentle Palmolive bath, brush my teeth with Crest, swallow two Sominex tablets, and try desperately to fall asleep on my Simmons Beautyrest mattress.’” (DeLillo 274-75)

“‘What do you think of the war?’ I said.
‘I’ve seen it on television.  It’s sponsored by instant coffee among other things.  The commercials are very tasteful in keeping with the serious theme of the program’s content.  Some of the commercials are racially integrated.  Since I worked for seven years as an employee of the network responsible for the warcasts, I am in a position to point out that the network and the agency joined forces in order to convince the sponsor that integrated commercials were desirable.  Their argument was that the war itself is integrated.  Balanced programming has always been one of the network’s chief aims.’” (DeLillo 284)

Austin (as David) on the black couple he’d filmed, and the dignity and meaning he thought they’d brought to the film he’d made:  “It took me a long time to see how wrong I was.  The camera implies meaning where no meaning exists.  I had not celebrated that brother and sister.  I had mocked them.  I had exploited their sorrow.  I had tried to make them part of a hopeful message on the state of the Union.  To be black is to be the actor.  To be white is to be the critic.” (DeLillo 286)

on language in the contemporary arts; first, the novelist attempting to undo language:  “I plan to take out the slang and replace it with new forms, new modes.  Maybe I’ll eliminate language itself.  It may be possible to find a completely new mode.”; then, the filmmaker attempting not to:  “In my little home movie, the thing I’m doing, I haven’t reduced the value of language at all.  I’ve reinforced it, in fact.  What I’ve reduced is movement, the kind of movement that tells a story or creates a harmony.  I want language to evolve from static forms.” (DeLillo 288-89)

with Carol:  “‘I’ve just realized how few black faces I’ve seen since I got here.’
‘Even the bibles in this town are white,’ she said.
‘The kind of town this is I bet they don’t even know what’s going on all over the goddamn country.’
‘They see it on the box.  It’s like watching the moon through a telescope.’” (DeLillo 312)

“Defeat is always glorious on film.... No camera can resist the man going down to defeat.” (DeLillo 315)
Part Four

“Whether the novels and songs usurped the land, or took something true from it, is not so much the issue as this:  that what I was engaged in was merely a literary venture, an attempt to find pattern and motive, to make of something wild a squeamish thesis on the essence of the nation’s soul.” (DeLillo 349)
