Lentricchia, Frank, ed.  Introducing Don DeLillo.  Durham:  Duke UP, 1991.


Frank Lentricchia, “The American Writer as Bad Citizen.”  1-6.

“It is the sort of mode that marks writers who conceive their vocation as an act of cultural criticism.” (Lentricchia 2)


Don DeLillo, “ ‘Opposites,’ Chapter 10 of Ratner’s Star.”  7-42.


Anthony DeCurtis, “ ‘An Outsider in This Society’:  An Interview with Don DeLillo.”  43-66.

DeLillo on the Kennedy assassination:  “I think we’ve all come to feel that what’s been missing over these past twenty-five years is a sense of manageable reality.  Much of that feeling can be traced to that one moment in Dallas.  We seem much more aware of elements like randomness and ambiguity and chaos since then.” (DeCurtis 48)

Media:  “DeCurtis:… It’s as though the power of the media in our culture hadn’t been fully felt until that point. // DeLillo:  It’s strange that the power of television was utilized to its fullest, perhaps for the first time, as it pertained to a violent event.  Not only a violent, but, of course, an extraordinarily significant event.  This has become part of our consciousness.  We’ve developed almost a sense of performance as it applies to televised events.” (DeCurtis 48-49)

“common memory” based in fiction?

“To merge with history is to escape the self.  I think Oswald knew this.” (DeCurtis 52)

the fiction writer tries to “redeem” the despair Branch feels at his inability to create a coherent narrative:  “Stories can be a consolation — at leas in theory.” (DeCurtis 56); “I think fiction rescues history from its confusions.” (DeCurtis 56)

“I see contemporary violence as a kind of sardonic response to the promise of consumer fulfillment in America.” (DeCurtis 57)

“The damage caused by Hitler was so enormous that Gladney feels haae can disappear inside it and that his own puny dread will be overwhelmed by the vastness, the monstrosity of Hitler himself.  He feels that Hitler is not only bigger than life, as we say of many famous figures, but bigger than death.” (DeCurtis 63)

“[My books are] about movements or feelings in the air and in the culture around us, without necessarily being part of the particular movement.  I mean, what I sense is suspicion and distrust and fear, and so, of course, these things inform my books.” (DeCurtis 66)


Daniel Aaron, “How to Read Don DeLillo.”  67-81.

“‘The writer is working against the age,’ he told an interviewer in 1983, ‘and so he feels some satisfaction in not being widely read.  He is diminished by an audience.’” (Aaron 73)


Hal Crowther, “Clinging to the Rock:  A Novelist’s Choices in the new Mediocracy.”  83-98.

“It strikes me that Don DeLillo may be recorded, and profit by being recorded, as the last serious novelist denounced by the American media establishment while it still acknowledged the existence of literature, or indeed of anything that wasn’t created by, for, or in conjunction with television.” (Crowther 83)

“Cultural paralysis is well advanced when none of the custodians of our public reality will interpret it or respect it, or even insist upon it; when no one but writers of fiction are interested in the facts.” (Crowther 98)


John A. McClure, “Postmodern Romance:  Don DeLillo and the Age of Conspiracy.”  99-115.

“The search for raw materials that preoccupies DeLillo is made necessary by the global elimination of such premodern places, the penetration of capitalism into all the enclaves once available for imaginative exploitation in romance.” (McClure 100)


Eugene Goodheart, “Some Speculations on Don DeLillo and the Cinematic Real.”  117-130.

the disembodied, two-dimensional, cinematic self

WN supermarket scenes:  the representation of food

“In a commercial culture dominated by the media and the values of advertising, and in an intellectual culture that textualizes the world and casts doubt about the existence of the real or of our ever being capable of knowing and experiencing it, the cinema (even more than the written text) becomes the place where we ‘truly live.’” (Goodheart 122)


Anthony DeCurtis, “The Product:  Bucky Wunderlick, Rock ‘n’ Roll, and Don DeLillo’s Great Jones Street.”  131-141.


Charles Molesworth, “Don DeLillo’s Perfect Starry Night.”  143-156.

LeClair’s In the Loop:  “a surplus of information becomes the chief threat of modern life and the perfectly expressive simulacrum for it” (Molesworth 151)


Dennis A. Foster, “Alphabetic Pleasures:  The Names.”  157-173.


John Frow, “The Last Things Before the Last:  Notes on White Noise.”  175-191.

“It is not that the postmodern marks the return of aestheticism, a non-ironic deployment of the full romantic cliché, but rather that it is the site of conjunction of the beautiful and the toxic.” (Frow 176)

Lyotard:  “With the sublime, the question of death enters the aesthetic question.”

the “new mode of typicality has two features:  it is constructed in representations which are then lived as real; and it is so detailed that it is not opposed to the particular.  The name usually given to it in the genre of postmodernity is the simulacrum.” (Frow 180)

re: the most photographed barn in America:  “the commodification of culture has worked to preserve the myth of — [never finished writing down the sentence!]

Baudrillardian melancholy in the face of the simulacrum v. Deleuzian freedom from Platonic ontology in denial of priority of original over copy

“The world is so saturated with representations that it becomes increasingly difficult to separate primary actions from imitations of actions.” (Frow 183)

“The supermarket is the privileged place for a phenomenology of surfaces.” (Frow 189)


Frank Lentricchia, “Libra as Postmodern Critique.”  193-215.

“TV,  productive medium of the image, is only one (albeit dominant) technological expression of an entire environment of the image.” (Lentricchia 195)

re Murray Siskind and the most photographed barn in America:  “This news about the loss of the referent, the dissolving of the object into its representations (the roadsigns, the photos) is delivered not with nostalgia for a lost world of the real but with joy.” (Lentricchia 196)

“The social environment of the typical naturalist character is displaced in DeLillo by the charismatic environment of the image, a new phase in American literature and culture — a new arena of action and a power of determination whose major effect is to realign radically all social agents (from top to bottom) as first-person agents of desire seeking self-annihilation and fulfillment in the magical third.” (Lentricchia 198)

Lee Harvey Oswald as contemporary production — media creation

“Film, in other words, is the culturally inevitable form of our self-consciousness, the medium of our ‘constantly watching ourselves’ in future filmic time perform the role of a self-to-be.” (Lentricchia 208) — film as the dominant mediator of self

Oswald as “the assassin as writer, a man isolated by his passion, room-bound, a plot schemer” (Lentricchia 209)

“The author [in American fiction]... is a transcendent figure, someone the reader is implicitly asked to identify with on the promise that, if he does, he will, like the author, be freed to be himself, autonomously disengaged from the need... that constantly throws us forward into some other, imagined existence.  This exit is sealed off from us in Libra.” (Lentricchia 210)

“the expressive forces of blood and earth are in the process of being overtaken and largely replaced by the forces of contemporary textuality.  Lives lived so wholly inside the media are lives expressed (in the passive mood) through voices dominated by the jargons of the media.” (Lentricchia 211)

Oswald’s “desired vocation” to become “a writer in the romantic, Emersonian vein who will sing his self because he will have been its original author” (Lentricchia 215) — perhaps, but look at the real state of writing in the novel!
