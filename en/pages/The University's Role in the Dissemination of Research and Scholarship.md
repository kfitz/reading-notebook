The University's Role in the Dissemination of Research and Scholarship -- A Call to Action. Association of American Universities, Association of Research Libraries, The Coalition for Networked Information, National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, 2009.

- "Traditionally, universities have relied largely on formal publication systems to ensure dissemination and their critical function in vetting new scholarship, but digital technologies have opened the door to an additional and broader range of dissemination possibilities and have generated entirely new forms of content that must be shared. This shift demands that universities take on a much more active role in ensuring dissemination of the knowledge produced by their institutions -- both now and in the future." (1-2)
- "To ensure the academy's ability to make its products accessible, it must employ existing infrastructure and continue to invest where needed in technological, organizational, and policy strategies to build capability within the academy to disseminate its work." (2)
- "Where universities support presses, work to realign presses more directly with the university mission. Encourage press investments in dissemination activities that correspond to areas of excellence on campus. Consider revising reporting relationships to encourage collaboration between presses and libraries. Invest in press/library collaborations." (5)
- "Create shared dissemination infrastructure to capture economies of scale and broaden access to researchers and scholars at institutions unable to support local infrastructure." (5)
