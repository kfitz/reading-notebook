Frank Lentricchia, “Introduction.”  1-14.

WN “found acceptance in the very place held up to satiric scrutiny in White Noise” (Lentricchia 6), the university

In WN, DeLillo “deploys” the form of the domestic novel in order to deconstruct it

Ratner’s Star as “Menippean satire” (Lentricchia 8)?

DeLillo produces “in the margins” of Running Dog an analysis of “the role of film in contemporary consciousness:  as commodity, as form of entertainment, as medium of Eros, and as the form of self-representation that defines postmodernism.  Film:  the chief artistic invention of the twentieth century as both mode of representing experience and as experience itself, all the experience we can know – film in and as consciousness” (Lentricchia 10).


Thomas J. Ferraro, “Whole Families Shopping at Night!”  15-38.

inconsequentiality of familial relations in novel – whose kids are whose?

after calculating who lives with whom, and their relationships:  “Each adult lives therefore with five other people whose average relation to him or her is only 20 percent; every child lives with five other people whose average relation to him or her is only 15 percent; and everyone in the household lives with five other people, each of whom is related on average by no more than (the same) 20 percent to everyone else in the house.” (Ferraro 17) – the problem is that no one seems bothered by this

conservative theorists like Allan Bloom (who considers the decline of the family to be the most pressing problem of contemporary society) and more radical ones like Christopher Lasch (who sees the potential for social change in the same circumstance) both trace this decline to the sexual revolution, the women’s movement, the decline in parental authority, etc.

“DeLillo, in a way that Lasch and especially Bloom do not, has a feel for the way the colonization of the home by mass culture achieves this effect of a ‘close-knit nuclear family’ without the ties of marriage and blood that, at least theoretically, grounded such families.  In White Noise, DeLillo examines not so much the individuating force of consumer culture as its communalizing power.  What he sees is how consumerism produces what we might call an aura of connectedness among individuals:  an illusion of kinship, transiently functional but without either sustaining or restraining power, a stimulant that at the same time renders one unable to feel either the sacredness or the tyranny of the family bond.” (Ferraro 20-21)

“DeLillo’s fiction lies at the cutting edge of mass-culture theory because he struggles to imagine how television as a medium functions within the home as the foremost site for what sociologists call our ‘primary’ social relations.  As DeLillo envisions it, television menaces the home with an omnipresent temptation to substitute the communal experience of the image for the ties that no longer bind.” (Ferraro 24)

see “The Last Things Before the Last:  Notes on White Noise” by John Frow

on the night of the catastrophes:  “Beyond the ethical dimension of taking pleasure in the suffering of others that attends this particular evening is a more general point about the nature of television’s threat:  the specter here of group addiction, fascistic cultism in and of the family.” (Ferraro 26)

Babette’s televised posture class:  “It was the picture that mattered” (WN 104) — tv as all image

“The rhetoric of light’s physicality suggests that the screen’s ultimate strategy is to destroy the distinction between flesh and image, re-presenting the image-in-all-its-fleshiness as the thing-in-itself.  If the vehicle that generates perception is to replace the object perceived, then television can be said to seduce us with a major reconstruction of the nature of reality itself.”  (Ferraro 26)

uneasiness of this scene: absence of Babette’s voice seems to suggest that “in making of Babette an image the media has robbed her of her inner self” (Ferraro 27)

Wilder’s crying before the blank screen — his fear that Babette (whose image he assumed was her) has disappeared — “signifies here the danger of television mediating all experience:  One day the transmission lines will go down and leave us staring before a blank screen, perhaps infantilized, no doubt helpless without our image-fix” (Ferraro 28) — I’d suggest, on the contrary, that Wilder’s tears signify not his addiction to the image but the real loss of his mother, who has really be transformed into an image

“image narcosis” (Ferraro 28)

grocery store trips as family mecca

two of Jack’s daughter’s have only met once before, at Disney World — both cavalierness about the dismantled family structure and exploitation about those disintegrating bonds on the part of consumer/media culture


Paul A. Cantor, “Adolph, We Hardly Knew You.”  39-62.

blandness of presentation of Hitler in book:  “just another subject of academic discourse, arousing no special passions” (Cantor 39-40)

“The bland acceptance of DeLillo’s treatment of Hitler in academic circles seems to mirror the very phenomenon White Noise portrays:  a scholarly world so open-minded that it can now accommodate any subject without evidently blinking an eye” (Cantor 40).

“Before rushing like Bawer to condemn DeLillo for moral indifference to Nazism, we ought to recognize that White Noise is not itself an example of Hitler studies, but rather a novel which portrays a professor involved in Hitler studies.  DeLillo may be trying to characterize the contemporary world by showing that such a phenomenon as Hitler studies has become possible in it.” (Cantor 41)

“the distinctively postmodern attitude toward history as a kind of museum, or, better yet, a supermarket of human possibilities” (Cantor 41)

Jack’s invention of Hitler studies as a kind of merchandising/marketing, revealing the meaninglessness of the product itself — I disagree; I think the product has tremendous, if unconscious meaning for Jack — seriously, March 1968?  That ain’t no coincidence

“Once a horrifying phenomenon like Hitler can be represented, it can be stripped of its aura and turned into a commodity.” (Cantor 44)

Hitler conference as serious jab at academia (Cantor 46)

“Scholars hate to deal with or ever acknowledge the unique; they always want to lump phenomena together under categories, to find continuity where others see discontinuity, in short, to place phenomena in ‘traditions.’  By setting White Noise within the academic world, DeLillo may have taken us close to the bloodless heart of postmodernism.  What I have been calling the distinctively postmodern attitude toward history is, mutatis mutandis, a characteristically scholarly attitude:  that all periods of history are equally valuable and worthy of study.  It is a curious fact that postmodernism as a cultural phenomenon has coincided with the era in which the university has come to play an increasingly dominant role in cultural life, as a patron, an arbiter of taste, and an interpreter of meaning to the general public.  Far from wholly identifying with professors like Jack Gladney, DeLillo may be using White Noise to suggest how the academic world, with its inability to deal with phenomena like Hitler authentically, has contributed to what might be called the postmodernization of contemporary life.” (Cantor 47)

Hitler as Jack’s means of restoring significance to his life?

“DeLillo has a chilling sense that in the twentieth century only the criminals have the courage of their convictions.” (Cantor 48)

“with all his emphasis on Nazi rallies, parades, and films, DeLillo suggests that Nazism is itself a simulacrum of greatness and nobility, more the product of Leni Riefenstahl’s camera than the heroic deeds of Nietzschean Ûbermenschen” (Cantor 55)

“Is DeLillo a postmodern writer or is he a pathologist of postmodernism?” (Cantor 58)

“Part of DeLillo wants to say that we have lost touch with everything that was authentic in our world and in our culture.  But I sense that part of DeLillo wants to say that nothing has really changed; things have always been this way.  We have our television, but the Nazi Germans had their movies, and neither culture stood in an unmediated relation to reality.” (Cantor 59)

“If postmodernism is the obliteration of all meaningful distinctions, then in the end it must efface even the distinction between postmodernism and any earlier phase of history.” (Cantor 60) — I’d add to this that it also effaces the distinction between itself and its critiques

“DeLillo himself seems unable to break out of the postmodern circle and offer a convincing alternative to its diminished reality.  In short, he can give us a vision of the inauthentic but not, it seems, of the authentic.” (Cantor 61)


Michael Valdez Moses, “Lust Removed from Nature.”  63-86.

“The world in which postmodern reality is taken to be the only ‘true’ one is a product of technology, or of its essence.” (Moses 63)

WN as an exploration of “an America in which technology has become not merely a pervasive and mortal threat to each of its citizens, but also, and more importantly, a deeply ingrained mode of existing and way of thinking that is the characteristic feature of the republic” (Moses 63)

Heidegger, “The Question Concerning Technology”

comparative reading of D & H on a number of issues:  “the essence of technology, the mutually reinforcing character of technology and consumer capitalism, the critique of the modern ‘world picture,’ the inauthenticity of contemporary existence, and the existential analysis of death” (Moses 64)

technological production of the simulacrum

enframing of technology transforms nature into a thing to be used at man’s convenience — standing-reserve, consumable product

“For DeLillo, even those groups within contemporary American society most attentive to the dangers of technological capitalism ultimately participate in a technological approach to the world.” (Moses 66) — see SIMUVAC

“For DeLillo’s characters, the immediate threat of death, brought on in some cases by the apparent failures of technology, may paradoxically serve a potentially redeeming function.  The far greater danger is that technology may succeed in creating an illusion that it constitutes the only possible manner by which human beings apprehend themselves and their relationship to the world.  The chief lure of technology, and its principal technique for domination of man’s ‘essence’ (to use Heidegger’s phrase) is its constantly reaffirmed promise of immortality.” (Moses 71)

“…the increasingly non-referential character of postmodern culture.  Since the technological media — television, the tabloids, radio, cinema — ultimately create their own reality, they appear to be free from all natural constraints on their constructions.” (Moses 72)

Babette on TV as a “coming into being”:  “Babette has become a luminous presence, a being permanently enduring in a timeless state” (Moses 72)

“the technological media also guarantee an essential psychic and physical distance between viewer and event, while creating the illusion of intimacy and nearness” (Moses 73)

“The technological media thus alienate the individual from personal death in at least two ways.  First, they transform the deaths of all individuals, insofar as they are captured on film or in ‘heavy print,’ into yet another commodity intended for mass consumption.  Second, by imposing an increasingly automatic and involuntary identification with the camera eye, the media fosters the illusion that the witnessing consciousness of the individual television viewer, like the media themselves, is a permanent fixture possessing a transcendental perspective.” (Moses 73)

Dylar’s elimination of angst:  Dylar as postmodern drug:  “follows the instrumental reasoning of a purely representational conception of the world; manipulate the signs, deconstruct the symptoms, and the cause or referent in effect disappears” (Moses 76)

“Having set out to reduce nature to an object and ultimately a construct, man succeeds in reducing human nature to an object or construct, a mere thing.” (Moses 77)

lingering question:  “How does one move beyond a critique of the Enlightenment principles of the new science without reverting to bizarre forms of mystical and antihuman violence…?” (Moses 82)

“One of the great merits of DeLillo’s fiction is the degree to which it remains deeply suspicious of the political prudence of all outspoken and ‘practicing’ theoreticians.  In White Noise, as in Ratner’s Star and The Names, DeLillo suggests that attempts to impose conceptual clarity and theoretical rigor on the habits of many human beings all too often tend to result in novel and sometimes dangerous forms of mystification.” (Moses 83-84)

“The problem with theoreticians like Murray is their willingness to recommend theoretical solutions with unpredictable but all too palpable consequences” (Moses 84)


Frank Lentricchia, “Tales of the Electronic Tribe.”  87-113.

Re assertion in Americana that television came over on the Mayflower:  “If television is the quintessential technological component of the postmodern temper (so it goes), and postmodernism the ethos of the electronic society, then with twenty years of hindsight on DeLillo’s book we can say that what actually cam over on the Mayflower was postmodernism itself, the founding piece of Americana.” (Lentricchia 87-88)

“the real subject” of the most photographed barn in America scene “is the electronic medium of the image as the active context of contemporary existence in America.  TV, a productive medium of the image, is only one (albeit dominant) technological expression of an entire environment of the image.  But unlike TV, which is an element in the contemporary landscape, the environment of the image is the landscape” (Lentricchia 88-89)

“the strange new world where the object of perception is perception itself:  a packaged perception, a ‘sight’ (in the genius of the vernacular), not a ‘thing’.” (Lentricchia 90)

Murray’s news about the loss of the referent “is delivered not with nostalgia for a lost world of the real but with joy” (Lentricchia 90)

Lentricchia points out the difficulties in pinning down DeLillo’s position in this scene; Murray’s pronouncements are not wholly ironic

“DeLillo’s Jack Gladney is a sharp observer and commentator” (Lentricchia 93) — really?

“Jack is a strong reader, a ceaseless professor, but DeLillo opens a space between him and the novel’s setting across which Jack’s interpretive energy cannot jump.” (Lentricchia 99)

“there is a type of white noise — more cultural than technological, another difficult distinction in postmodern context — more rather then less in focus, more in focus especially if you’re a Jack or a Murray, a type of the intellectual found flourishing (but hardly exclusively so) in the humanities wing of institutions of higher learning:  the habitually ironic cultural critic, the urban intellectual guerilla finely attuned to the presence of the media as powerful shaper of the way we crystallize ourselves for ourselves and for others; who believes in his own freedom just because he knows how the culture industry works; who believes in the West’s classic philosophical dictum, that self-knowledge sets us free, though he’s generally too cool to say he believes in anything.” (Lentricchia 100)
