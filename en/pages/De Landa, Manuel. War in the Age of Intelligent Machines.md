Introduction

imagined robot-authored history:  “While a human historian might try to understand the way people assembled clockworks, motors, and other physical contraptions, a robot historian would likely place a stronger emphasis on the way these machines affected human evolution.  The robot would stress the fact that when clockworks once represented the dominant technology on the planet, people imagined the world around them as a similar system of cogs and wheels…. Later, when motors came along, people began to realize that many natural systems behave more like motors…” (3)

“the role of humans would be seen as little more than that of industrious insects pollinating an independent species of machine-flowers that simply did not possess its own reproductive organs during a segment of its evolution” (3)

history of military applications of AI, “from an angle that stresses the effects of technology on the military” (4)

also interested in light computers shed on self-organizing or emergent systems; suggests that “behind self-organization there is a ‘machinic phylum,’ that behind the spontaneous emergence of order out of chaos there are deep mathematical similarities” (7)
