Willinsky, John. The Access Principle: The Case for Open Access to Research and Scholarship. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2006.


"Public access to research has become all the more important in recent years with the increased emphasis on political accountability and the corresponding call for 'evidence-based policymaking' in government." (Willinsky xi)

"What is clear at this point is that open access to research archives and journals has the potential to change the public presence of science and scholarship and increase the circulation of this particular form of knowledge.  What is also clear is that the role that open access will play in the future of scholarly publishing depends on decisions that will be made over the [next] few years by researchers, editors, scholarly societies, publishers, and research-funding agencies." (Willinsky xi)

"my approach to open access is to hold to an access principle that could be put this way: *A commitment to the value and quality of research carries with it a responsibility to extend the circulation of such work as far as possible and ideally to all who are interested in it and all who might profit by it.*" (Willinsky xii)

"open access is not free access... the open access movement is not operating in denial of economic realities. Rather, it is concerned with increasing access to more of the research literature for more people, with that increase measured over what is currently available in print and electronic formats." (Willinsky xii)

"The first of these events is a steady escalation in journal prices, with the rate neatly summarized by Peter Suber, both analyst and advocate of open access developments, as 'four times faster than inflation for nearly two decades.' The second event is the advent of the Internet and digital publishing, which in a decade has changed how readers access journals and created a viable alternative to a publishing model that, as a result of the first event, was otherwise rendering more and more of the literature affordable to fewer and fewer institutions." (Willinsky xiii)

"The access principle that underlies this book -- namely, that a *commitment to the value and quality of research carries with it a responsibility to extend the circulation of this work as far as possible, and ideally to all who are interested in it and all who might profit by it*" (Willinsky 5)

"What makes research and scholarship such a natural topic for thinking about setting up knowledge commons and publishing cooperatives devoted to providing open access is this work's standing as a *public good*." (Willinsky 9)

"At this point, however, scholarly publishing is struggling to maintain a terribly inefficient triple-sided economy in the transition of journals from print to digital editions.  First of all, publishers continue to employ the traditional industrial apparatus of print, even as manuscripts are prepared and managed electronically.  Secondly, publishers are developing sophisticated Web-based systems for publishing, distributing, and indexing electronic editions within their own portals, as well as continuing to produce print editions.  And finally, libraries have developed no less sophisticated technical infrastructures for providing their patrons with access to these and other digital resources." (Willinsky 10)

"How can access to research be declining, one might well ask, in a knowledge society?  This age-of-information paradox follows on the successful transformation of knowledge into a capitalized commodity and economic driver.  The university community, at least in some quarters, has caught hold of this wave. And as a whole, the academy has been growing increasingly productive in patents, research articles, and doctorates.  At the same time, the major journal publishers have been all about merger and acquisition as part of this know-biz phenomenon.  The resulting corporate publishing concentration, with its relentless focus on knowledge capitalization and shareholder value, has seen journal prices increase well above inflation rates, and university libraries cannot keep up." (Willinsky 17)

"Profits are coming not only from increased prices and publishing efficiencies, but from taking greater advantage of the growing number of titles publishers hold, through such strategies as 'bundling' titles in licensing arrangements with libraries that carry no-cancel policies for all of the titles in the bundle." (Willinsky 17)

"Academic publishing is an end in itself.  As such, the recognition of one's peers does not simply follow from what one achieves in one's field; this is the very field one plows with the work.  That is, recognition of one's peers is the principal measure of one's contribution to a field of inquiry" (Willinsky 21)

"To have an article accepted by one of these high-priced journals, or to be asked to sit on its board, or perhaps even to serve as an editor, can easily blind a faculty member to what can seem to be the librarians' issue over the journal's pricing." (Willinsky 21)

"the vanity factor is not at all the enemy of open access.  Open access is not only about human rights and the greater circulation of knowledge.  It is about increasing *research impact*" (Willinsky 22)

"in study after study and discipline after discipline... open access is associated with increased citations for authors and journals, when compared to similar work that is not open access." (Willinsky 22)

"For journals that are not prepared to make their articles freely available to readers immediately on publication, there is now a range of options for increasing access: Journals can enable authors to deposit articles (in preprint and postprint stages) in an e-print archive run by the authors' institutions or to post them on the authors' own Web sites immediately on publication.  Journals can make their contents free to read online some six to twelve months after initial publication.  Journals can make their contents freely and immediately available to those working at universities in developing countries." (Willinsky 27)

"One reason to focus on the variety of open access models is to dispel the idea that greater access to the knowledge represented by scholarly publishing is an all-or-nothing proposition.... Having recognized the importance of increasing access to knowledge, publishers have found ways of offering greater access to journals without severing the journal's entire revenue stream, or even reducing the number or cost of subscriptions, in some cases." (Willinsky 28)

"It is a tradition bent on increasing the democratic circulation of knowledge, with a lineage that can also be traced back, for example, to the 'invisible colleges' of the seventeenth century, which were comprised of informal study clubs that would gather in coffee houses, otherwise known as 'penny universities'" (Willinsky 30)

"I realize that greater access to this research and scholarship will not always be welcomed.  Some may object that the last thing the world needs at this point is access to more information, let alone more people participating in the production of it. But this stance smacks of the privilege that comes of already having considerable access to research resources." (Willinsky 31)

"Open access can also lead to the introduction of other scholarly traditions into the research literature, extending that metaphorical conversation that defines one ideal for this body of work." (Willinsky 32)

"I see the social dimensions of knowledge dissemination, within the current economics of reduced circulation, as a moral failure as much as a cognitive failure." (Willinsky 34)

"this interest in balancing the interests of both author and public is what makes copyright a strong and natural ally of open access for research and scholarship." (Willinsky 41)

on "work-made-for-hire" clauses:  "The first thing this contract does is reverse what would otherwise seem to be the case, namely, that the academic community hires the publishers, in effect, to provide a service necessary for the circulation of knowledge.  Instead, this contract positions the editor, and by implication the author, as working for the publisher." (Willinsky 45)

"The publisher needs only *first-publication rights* from an author to protect the journal's position in the marketplace of ideas by being the first outlet in which the article appears." (Willinsky 47)

"The key to copyright is the right of authors to *profit* from their work.  Yet journal publishers have not made their editors or authors financial partners in the publishing economy they have created (whereas the same publishers pay royalties to the authors of books they publish). Authors turn their work over to publishers in exchange for having the work reviewed and published. Though they may not have come to recognize it yet, those authors who choose to publish their work in journals that do not offer some form of open access, and do so without also submitting the article to an e-print archive, may be working against their own best interests." (Willinsky 49)

"The publishers are no longer the roadblock to open access, in Harnad's book, given the number that permit self-archiving.  The problem is the authors.  They remain blind to the greater research impact they could achieve by uploading a paper to an archive, which takes all of about six minutes" (Willinsky 53)

"Although some have accused the associations of riding the upward subscription price spiral of corporate publishers to their advantage, what is perhaps more troubling is the number of scholarly associations that have turned their journals over to these publishers, effectively moving the journals out of the nonprofit sector." (Willinsky 56)

"So what is a scholarly association to do, where is it to turn? Well, as always, it should turn to the best interests of its membership. What other purpose does it have? From a researcher-as-author perspective, increased readership (and citation) will always trump journal revenues. Associations need to recognize, if they have not already, the declining value of a membership copy of an association's journals. On the other hand, opening access to the journals increases their readership (and that of the association's author-members). The question for the associations is, Why keep the membership's research from those in the field who do not belong to the association or have access to a good research library if a form of open access to this literature can be provided without destroying the viability of the association's journal publishing?" (Willinsky 60)

"what about strategies that would see the associations into a postprint future?  What if a scholarly association went to one of the library organizations that represents the vast majority of its subscribers, such as the Association of Research Libraries or the Association of College and Research Libraries, and proposed a different kind of agreement between publisher and library that indeed furthered the access principle? That proposal would take the form of a publishing cooperative between scholarly and library associations that would be guided by two principles: providing sustainable support for managing and publishing the association's journals and providing immediate open access to the journals." (Willinsky 64)

"associations will need to seriously reconsider the journal as a revenue stream for supporting the rest of the organization, when maintaining this revenue stream is costing the journal's authors the readership they deserve and desire." (Willinsky 65)

"The pleasures of the printed page -- at least when it comes to the journal -- may no longer justify denying the rights of tens of thousands of interested faculty and students access to this knowledge, in the face of open access alternatives that would expand the circulation of knowledge." (Willinsky 67)

"It may indeed seem something of a heartless approach to place experienced and knowledgeable editorial assistants' jobs on the line through the use of automated systems to, in effect, file, record, date, notify, look up, assemble, calculate, and on and on.  Yet where cost reductions are used to support open access, at least, a trade-off is being made that brings to the fore the very purpose of the journal, which is to extend the circulation of knowledge." (Willinsky 74-75)

on Mellon:  "The foundation, which might be thought of as the great venture capitalist of scholarly publishing start-ups, has always been keen to see a sound business plan for any new endeavor." (Willinsky 82)

"Membership in a publishing and archiving cooperative would enable libraries to participate more directly in journal publishing and archiving to ensure affordable access to research and scholarship." (Willinsky 85)

"as Donald Waters, a program officer of the Mellon Foundation, has pointed out, the 'sustainability of digital scholarly resources' depends on three factors, namely, 'a clear definition of the audience and the needs of users,' sensible 'economies of scale,' and a well-organized means to 'manage the resource over time'" (Willinsky 91)

"While the public use of research published in a scholarly journal will add little or nothing to the publishing costs of the journal -- barring an overwhelming surge of interest in a particular title -- it will increase the presence and impact of the work published.  And this may lead, in turn, to greater public support for research and scholarship." (Willinsky 111)

"I would argue that proving that the public has sufficient interest in, or capacity to understand, the results of scholarly research is not the issue.  The public's right of access to this knowledge is not something that people have to earn.  It is grounded in a basic right to know."  (Willinsky 125)

"It falls to the scholarly community to keep its work in an orderly and well-indexed form, so that precisely what is needed on a given topic can be brought to bear on it." (Willinsky 125)

"the value of access to this literature lies in how the body of research as a whole can serve as a public resource, helping people to articulate and understand the different positions being taken, as well as the points of disagreement." (Willinsky 132)

"as far as the inevitable limits these people experience in making sense of what they come across, especially with health research, it hardly forms a compelling argument against experimenting with increasing their access to a wider body of research." (Willinsky 135)

"on hearing the case for open access, some have warned me that should we open the doors to the scholarly literature, the public will discover what many researchers already believe, which is that too much scholarly work represents poorly written exercises in career maintenance and advancement.  Yet this overstated critique only raises the need for a more fundamental calling to account of higher education.  If some substantial portion of the literature is indeed vacuous and bereft of value, then perhaps open access might foster, in some small measure, a correction, by making public impact and meaningfulness something worth striving for in conducting research." (Willinsky 137)

"The right to know that is inherent in the access principle has a claim on our humanity that stands with other basic rights, whether to life, liberty, justice, or respect.  More than that, access to knowledge is a human right that is closely associated with the ability to defend, as well as to advocate for, other rights." (Willinsky 143)

"This right to know does not imply that research and scholarship should be distributed without charge to any interested reader.  Rather, it suggests only that there be no unwarranted impediment to that access." (Willinsky 144)

"For scholars working in the humanities, the right to philosophy is protected by the university's independence, or in Derrida's words, by 'an *unconditional* freedom to question and assert, or even the right to say publicly all that is required by research, knowledge, and thought concerning the truth'...
     This is where I am tempted to interject a question on whether Derrida's defense of the 'right to say everything' means much of anything for a member of the academic community if the 'right to say it publicly, to publish it' is not closely related to the right of others to see what has been said in the name of philosophy" (Willinsky 147)

"it would be a philosophical encounter, in Derrida's sense, that would add to their understanding of what the humanities do -- and humanities scholars must not be afraid of that -- just as it would add to people's sense of having a right to know, a right to philosophy" (Willinsky 151)

"The specter of learning at issue, then, is about what is *self-taught* and the persuasive power of autodidactism." (Willinsky 151)

"the value of the journal literature will remain in its scholarly depth of analysis, which need not be compromised by opening up access to this literature, for all that it might yet provide to that wider public and professional audience" (Willinsky 152)

"a continuing decline in that circulation, brought on by the increasing expense of keeping up with the journal literature, does not bode well for the future of the university and what it would make of knowledge, especially as the academic community continues to expand on a worldwide basis." (Willinsky 152)

"It may well be that the very independence of scholarship, which adds greatly to its value in the struggle for human rights, has rested for far too long on its relative inaccessibility.... Derrida's notion, then, of the 'weakness and vulnerability of the university' is in this case about the university's failure to take any form of responsibility for supporting the larger academic community that has developed on a global basis" (Willinsky 153)

"Scholars working in this area need to see how readily they have allowed their scholarship to become subject to corporate interests in a knowledge economy of publisher mergers and acquisitions, as well as journal licensing surveillance and enforcement." (Willinsky 153)

"Reading online may yet prove to be a significant extension of the scholarly apparatus, comparable in some ways to the introduction of the scholarly footnote many centuries before, which also encouraged readers to consider the source of the work they were reading." (Willinsky 155)

"What is at issue with open access, however, is whether and how the new publishing environment engendered by these extended features can support a much wider range of readers." (Willinsky 157)

"The point is not to compare the common reader's experience to that of the scholar's in terms of depth or reach.  It is to ask whether the knowledge generated by scholarly endeavor has become a greater part of human experience as a result of the move to a new, promising medium and whether scholars have done all that they can, as authors of the work presenting this knowledge, to ensure that it is as open, and as well-designed in that openness, as possible." (Willinsky 170)

"Despite this considerable array of indexes and portals, earnest scholars and students still have to wend their way through overlaps, gaps, and partiality in the coverage of the research literature that the indexes provide, even as the university librarians struggle against the corrosive effects of cost increases for both indexes and journals that continue to exceed the growth of the library's budget." (Willinsky 173)

"The road from costly to open access in indexing is paved by integrating the indexing into the publishing process (leaving aside government-run indexes like PubMed), rather than having a third party undertake the indexing once the literature is published" (Willinsky 180)

"The One Great Scholarly Search Engine has become something of the Holy Grail of indexing" (Willinsky 182)

"The key to making automated and open access indexing systems work is drawing authors further into the publishing and positioning of their work." (Willinsky 185-86)

"a few distinct parallels between the introduction of the scientific journal in the culture of print and the critical decisions now faced in moving the journal online." (Willinsky 190)

"The universities were not early champions of the printed book.  Their faculty members were happy enough to continue, at least initially, with the known world of manuscripts and medieval thinking." (Willinsky 192)

"Sending someone's scientific ideas out for a second and third opinion had been unceremoniously and informally instituted in the republic of letters some time before the first issue of a scientific journal was published.... The initial vehicle for peer review was the letter." (Willinsky 193)
