## Introduction: Affect in the Present

“A relation of cruel optimism exists when something you desire is actually an obstacle to your flourishing…. These kinds of optimistic relation are not inherently cruel. They become cruel only when the object that draws your attachment actively impedes the aim that brought you to it initially.”

“one of optimism’s ordinary pleasures is to induce conventionality, that place where appetites find a shape in the predictable comforts of the good-life genres that a person or a world has seen fit to formulate.”

"Whatever the experience of optimism is in particular, then, the affective structure of an optimistic attachment involves a sustaining inclination to return to the scene of fantasy that enables you to expect that this time, nearness to this thing will help you or a world to become different in just the right way.”

"Fantasy is the means by which people hoard idealizing theories and tableaux about how they and the world 'add up to something.’”

"The book is about what happens to fantasies of the good life when the ordinary becomes a landfill for overwhelming and impending crises of life-building and expectation whose sheer volume so threatens what it has meant to 'have a life' that adjustment seems like an accomplishment.” 

"One of this book's central claims is that the present is perceived, first, affectively: the present is what makes itself present to us before it becomes anything else, such as an orchestrated collective event or an epoch on which we can look back.”

"Focus on the present isn't invariably shallow presentism, or 'the narcissism of the now,’ therefore—but even when it is, it involves anxiety about how to assess various knowledges and intuitions about what's happening and how to eke out a sense of what follows from those assessments.”

"the impasse is a stretch of time in which one moves around with a sense that the world is at once intensely present and enigmatic, such that the activity of living demands both a wandering absorptive awareness and a hypervigilance that collects material that might help to clarify things, maintain one's sea legs, and coordinate the standard melodramatic crises with those processes that have not yet found their genre of event."

"A situation is a state of things in which something that will perhaps matter is unfolding amid the usual activity of life. It is a state of animated and animating suspension that forces itself on consciousness, that produces a sense of the emergence of something in the present that may become an event."

"The situation is therefore a genre of social time and practice in which a relation of persons and worlds is sensed to be changing but the rules for habitation and the genres of storytelling about it are unstable, in chaos."

"Thus rather than tracking the 'waning of affect' as the mark of the present, I track the waning of genre, and in particular older realist genres (in which I include melodrama) whose conventions of relating fantasy to ordinary life and whose depictions of the good life now appear to mark archaic expectations about having and building a life."

"In the present from which I am writing about the present, conventions of reciprocity that ground how to live and imagine life are becoming undone in ways that force the gestures of ordinary improvisation within daily life into a greater explicitness affectively and aesthetically."

"Implied in what precedes this is a claim that, across diverse geopolitical and biopolitical locations, the present moment increasingly imposes itself on consciousness as a moment in extended crisis, with one happening piling on another. The genre of crisis is itself a heightening interpretive genre, rhetorically turning an ongoing condition into an intensified situation in which extensive threats to survival are said to dominate the reproduction of life. At the same time, as chapter 3, 'Slow Death,' argues, the genre of crisis can distort something structural and ongoing within ordinariness into something that seems shocking and exceptional."

"Instead of the vision of the everyday organized by capitalism that we find in Lefebvre and de Certeau, among others, I am interested in the overwhelming ordinary that is disorganized by it, and by many other forces besides."

"A traumatic event is simply an event that has the capacity to induce trauma. My claim is that most such happenings that force people to adapt to an unfolding change are better described by a notion of systemic crisis or 'crisis ordinariness’ and followed out with an eye to seeing how the affective impact takes form, becomes mediated."

"To this set of objections I would say that the current recession congeals decades of class bifurcation, downward mobility, and environmental, political, and social brittleness that have increased progressively since the Reagan era. The intensification of these processes, which reshapes conventions of racial, gendered, sexual, economic, and nation-based subordination, has also increased the probability that structural contingency will create manifest crisis situations in ordinary existence for more kinds of people."

"This book is not offering sociologically empirical cases about who beats the system and who succumbs to its systemic stresses, although it draws widely from an interdisciplinary body of secondary material on these matters. It is a book about the attrition of a fantasy, a collectively invested form of life, the good life. As that fantasy has become more fantasmatic, with less and less relation to how people can live-as the blueprint has faded-its attrition manifests itself in an emerging set of aesthetic conventions that make a claim to affective realism derived from embodied, affective rhythms of survival."

“Even when it turns out to involve a cruel relation, it would be wrong to see optimism’s negativity as a symptom of an error, a perversion, damage, or a dark truth: optimism is, instead, a scene of negotiated sustenance that makes life bearable as it presents itself ambivalently, unevenly, incoherently."


## One: Cruel Optimism

### I. Optimism and Its Objects

“attachments do not all feel optimistic… But being drawn to return to the scene where the object hovers in its potentialities is the operation of optimism as an affective form. In optimism, the subject leans toward promises contained within the present moment of the encounter with her object."

“What’s cruel about these attachments, and not merely inconvenient or tragic, is that the subjects who have x in their lives might not well endure the loss of their object/scene of desire, even though its presence threatens their well-being, because whatever the content of the attachment is, the continuity of its form provides something of the continuity of the subject’s sense of what it means to keep on living on and to look forward to being in the world."

“But if the cruelty of an attachment is experienced by someone/some group, even in a subtle fashion, the fear is that the loss of the promising object/scene itself will defeat the capacity to have any hope about anything."

“I have indeed wondered whether all optimism is cruel, because the experience of loss of the conditions of its reproduction can be so breathtakingly bad, just as the threat of the loss of x in the scope of one’s attachment drives can feel like a threat to living on itself. But some scenes of optimism are clearly crueler than others…"

“One makes affective bargains about the costliness of one’s attachments, usually unconscious ones, most of which keep one in proximity to the scene of desire/attrition."

“To understand cruel optimism, therefore, one must embark on an analysis of indirection, which provides a way to think about the strange temporalities of projection into an enabling object that is also disabling."

“recognition is the misrecognition you can bear, a transaction that affirms you without, again, necessarily feeling good or being accurate"

“In a narrator’s partial-merging with a character’s consciousness, say, free indirect discourse performs the impossibility of locating an observational intelligence in one or any body, and therefore forces the reader to transact a different, more open relation of unfolding to what she is reading, judging, being, and thinking she understands."

“(The seeming detachment of rationality, for example, is not a detachment at all, but an emotional style associated normatively with a rhetorical practice.)"

“what happens when the loss of what’s not working is more unbearable than the having of it"

“The conditions of ordinary life in the contemporary world even of relative wealth, as in the United States, are conditions of the attrition or the wearing out of the subject, and the irony that the labor of reproducing life in the contemporary world is also the activity of being worn out by it has specific implications for thinking about the ordinariness of suffering, the violence of normativity, and the ‘technologies of patience’ that enable a concept of the later to suspend questions about the cruelty of the now."

### II. The Promise of the Object

“the privilege of being bored with life"

“‘we’ live with a sense of slight excitement, composing ourselves patiently toward fulfilling the promise of living not too intensely the good life of what Slavoj Žižek might call a decaffeinated sublime."

“Marx comments on the political economy of such a self-medicating and self-mediating subject orientation as an outcome of its relation to regimes of private property"

“‘We’ live in proximity to a desire not bound up in this version of the good life and can almost remember being alive in it, flooded by a sense of expectation that ‘we’ knew was only pointed to by property and the dependable life we meant to make for it. Our cruel objects don’t feel threatening, just tiring."

“A bourgeois is someone who instrumentalizes his social relations in terms of the rules of the market, and who is zoned by the people who assign value to property as having value in proximity to his property and his being self-possessed."

“The ‘homme’ in the house who sees himself as effective in the world and an authority in all domains of activity is distinguished and made singular by participation in a community of love, among people who choose each other—who, one might say, can come up to each other."

“The event of the poem is the thing that happens when he comes up to me and reminds me that I am not the subject of a hymn but of a hum, the thing that resonates around me"

“What intersubjectivity there is has not content but is made in the simultaneity of listening, a sense of subjective experience that can only be seen and not heard along with the poet and his ‘him.’"

“It is always a risk to let someone in, to insist on a pacing different from the productivist pacing, say, of capitalist normativity."

“It gestures toward being lost or suspended in a process of knowing nothing about how a scene of collaborative action will open up a space of potential liveness that is not a space on which anything can be built."

“If its happiness is cruel, requiring someone else’s or some class’s expenditure, we’ll never know: the substitution of habituated indifference with a spreading pleasure might open up a wedge into an alternative ethics of living, or not."

“analytically this singular lyric opens up an opportunity to learn to pay attention to, have transference with, those moments of suspension in which the subject can no longer take his continuity in the material world and contemporary history for granted, because he feels full of a something ineloquently promising, a something that reveals, at the same time, a trenchant nothing about the general conditions of optimism and cruel optimism."

### III. The Promise of Exchange Value

“For Cooter fantasy isn’t a plan. It calibrates nothing about how to live. It is the action of living for him, his way of passing time not trying to make something of himself in a system of exploitation and exchange."

“Change is an impact lived on the body before anything is understood, and as such is simultaneously meaningful and ineloquent, engendering an atmosphere that they spend the rest of the story and their lives catching up to."

“Exchange value is not identical to the price of things, but marks a determination of what else a thing can get exchanged for, as though money were not involved, exactly, in the mediations."

“The scene of shocking wealth changes the terms of the meaning of life, of the reproduction of life, and of exchange itself."

“Theory aside, in practice Cooter doesn’t have a clue what to do with the money and realizes sickeningly, right away, that money cannot make you feel like you belong if you are not already privileged to feel that way."

“‘Exchange Value’ demonstrates the proximity of two kinds of cruel optimism: with little cultural or economic capital and bearing the history of a racial disinheritance from the norms of white supremacist power, you work yourself to death, or coast to nonexistence; or, with the ballast of capital, you hoard against death, deferring life, until you die."

“whereas the earlier modes of optimism included a community and a meanwhile that meant being somewhere and knowing people no matter what style of living-on one chose, the later modes almost force privacy, hoarding, becoming pure potential itself."

“If consumption promises satisfaction in substitution and then denies it because all objects are rest stops amid the process of remaining unsatisfied that counts for being alive under capitalism, in the impasse of desire, then hoarding seems like a solution to something."

“the object of cruel optimism here appears as the thing within any object to which one passes one’s fantasy of sovereignty for safekeeping."

### IV. The Promise of Being Taught

“Even amid the racial mediations entrenched in capitalist inequalities in the United States, optimism involves thinking that in exchange one can achieve recognition. But, one must always ask, recognition of what? One’s self-idealization, one’s style of ambivalence, one’s tender bits, or one’s longing for the event of recognition itself?"

“the novel offers a two-step of saturation in mass fantasy and history as solutions to the problem of surviving the brutality of trauma and optimism in the ordinary world. It sees leaving the singular for the general through embracing a range of stranger intimacy as the best resource for thriving, but in at least once case, even those encounters endanger the subject who is so worn out by the work of surviving the bad life that all she has left, in a sense, are her defenses."

“All of these stories are about the cruelty of optimism revealed to people without control over the material conditions of their lives, or whose relation to fantasy is such that the perverse shuttling between fantasy and realism destroys, according to Ryman, people and the nation."

“To protect her last iota of optimism, she goes crazy."

“Creating an impasse, a space of internal displacement, in this view, shatters the normal hierarchies, clarities, tyrannies, and confusions of compliance with autonomous individuality. This strategy looks promising in the Ashbery poem. But in ‘Exchange Value,’ a moment of relief produces a psychotic defense against the risk of losing optimism."

“Any object of optimism promises to guarantee the endurance of something, the survival of something, the flourishing of something, and above all the protection of the desire that made this object or scene powerful enough to have magnetized an attachment to it. When these relations of proximity and approximate exchange happen, the hope is that what misses the mark and disappoints won’t much threaten anything in the ongoing reproduction of life, but will allow zones of optimism a kind of compromised endurance…. But so many of the normative and singular objects made available for investing in the world are themselves threats to both the energy and the fantasy of ongoingness, namely, that people/collectivities face daily the cruelty not just of potentially relinquishing their objects or changing their lives, but of losing the binding that fantasy itself has allowed to what’s potentially there in the risky domains of the yet untested and unlived life."

“The vague expectations of normative optimism produce small self-interruptions as the heterotopias of sovereignty amid structural inequality, political depression, and other intimate disappointments. By staging the impasse in which breakdown does its work on suspending the rules and norms of the world, these works show us how to pay attention to the built and affective infrastructure of the ordinary, and how to encounter what happens when infrastructural stress produces a dramatic tableau. In scenarios of cruel optimism we are forced to suspend ordinary notions of repair and flourishing to ask whether the survival scenarios we attach to those affects weren’t the problem in the first place."


## Two: Intuitionists: History and the Affective Event

### I. The Way We Live Now: Affect, Mediation, Ideology

“So far, we have focused on the conceptual component of cruel optimism, proposing that optimism is cruel when it takes shape as an affectively stunning double bind: a binding to fantasies that block the satisfactions they offer, and a binding to the promise of optimism as such that the fantasies have come to represent…. What remains, therefore, is to specify how the activity of affective attachment can be located formally in a historical, cultural, and political field in ways that clarify the process of knotty tethering to objects, scenes, and modes of life that generate so much overwhelming yet sustaining negation."

“At least since Althusser, ideology theory has been the place to which critical theory has gone for explanations of affective realism, of how people’s desires become mediated through attachments to modes of life to which they rarely remember consenting, at least initially."

“We assume our position as subjects in a world and therefore it is in us as a structuring condition for apprehending anything."

“As its title suggests, this chapter introduces ‘intuition’ as the process of dynamic sensual data-gathering through which affect takes shape in forms whose job it is to make reliable sense of life."

“Intuition is where affect meets history, in all of its chaos, normative ideology, and embodied practices of discipline and invention."

“The story of how attachment to reproducing the intelligibility of the world nudges affective forces into line with normative realism is also the story of liberal subjectivity’s fantasies of individual and collective sovereignty, the public and the private, the past’s relation to the future, and the distribution of sensibilities that discipline the imaginary about what the good life is and how proper people act. But the idiom that affect theory can provide encourages more than a focus on orthodoxies of institutions and practices. It can provide a way to assess the disciplines of normativity in relation to the disorganized and disorganizing processes of labor, longing, memory, fantasy, grief, acting out, and sheer psychic creativity through which people constantly (consciously, unconsciously, dynamically) renegotiate the terms of reciprocity that contour their historical situation."

“Therefore, I would claim, affect theory is another phase in the history of ideology theory; the moment of the affective turn brings us back to the encounter of what is sensed with what is known and what has impact in a new but also recognizable way."

“The aesthetic and political point seems to be, in all cases, that the drama of adjustment to a pervasive atmosphere of unexpected precarity makes certain situations exemplary laboratories for sensing contemporary life in new idioms of affective realism."

“My aim is to construct a mode of analysis of the historical present that moves us away from the dialectic of structure (what is systemic in the reproduction of the world), agency (what people do in everyday life), and the traumatic event of their disruption, and toward explaining crisis-shaped subjectivity amid the ongoingness of adjudication, adaptation, and improvisation."

“Survival in the present of an ordinary collective life suffused with a historic and historical crisis to which we are always catching up is the way we live now."

“There are neighborhoods where strangers live and play as though without a care, but one never knows from the outside whether play is a forgettable moment or a life-saving interruption of anxious waiting."

“Ritual is yet another genre of the present. It evokes a tradition, and respects the place of tradition in the ongoing punctuation of time. It sutures different temporal arcs. It gestures toward therapy and redemption without narrating those ends. Most significantly, the ritual habit is another route to preserving banality, turning care of the self into a mode of ordinariness."

“To be in crisis is not to have the privilege of the taken-for-granted: it is to bear an extended burden of vulnerability for an undetermined duration. To be in goes-without-saying ordinariness can only be an aspiration for those whose other option is to be overmastered by the moment of the even that began at a time that only retroactively leads one to diagnosis."

### II. Histories of the Present

“In the previous section, my aim was to introduce the scene of a historical present that becomes apprehensible as an affective urgency to remake intuitions for living through collecting presentist genres—conversation, pathocartography, ritual—that might someday achieve a habitual rhythm."

“In these narrative histories of the present, a shift between knowing and uncertain intuitionisms enables us to think about being in history as a densely corporeal, experientially felt thing whose demands on survival skills map not the whole world in one moment but a way to think about the history of sensualized epistemologies in the atmosphere of a particular moment now (aesthetically) suspended in time."

“Notably, theorists from Lukács to Jameson and Benedict Anderson, to name a few, have cast historicism via the historical novel as the aesthetic expression of an affective epistemology, an encounter with the historical present via the intensities of its tone, whether emergent, chaotic, or waning."

“historians of the historical novel have long understood the genre as a locus of affective situations that not only generate exemplary aesthetic conventions but exemplify political and subjective formations local to a particular time and space."

“Critics read these novels for the sense of the historical they provide: history is neither in footnotes, nor in the representation of historical figures or events, nor in style as such, as in the period piece, but in atmospheres (an aesthetic genre)."

“for Scott and his heirs the point of the historical novel was a paradoxical one: to become embedded in the affective life of a past moment that might have been the run-up to the future that was now a present, and to create distances from the present moment of writing whose own shared contours one can only intuit."

“too often we derive a sense of a time, place, and power through historical archives whose job it is to explain something aesthetic without thinking the aesthetic in the sensually affective terms that conventions of entextualizing always code, perform, and release."

“What constitutes continuity amid the pressure of structural inconstancy? What is the good life when the world that was to have been delivered by upward mobility and collective uplift that national/capitalism promised goes awry in front of one? What is life when the body cannot be relied on to keep up with the constant flux of new incitements and genres of the reliable, but must live on, maintaining footing, nonetheless?"

### III. The Affectsphere and the Event

“both novels push the traditionally empirical material of the historical  novel into the register of utopias that won’t wait, that demand a more robust place in the present than any heterotopic fold can offer."

“As their singular stories turn into exemplary ones, the focus is less on how historically simulated affect is being transmitted to them across eras and spaces than on what this affects organization of force and desire reveals for living on generally."

“Life in the impasse turns from threat to aim. To enter experience without eventilizing it will mean knowing something is afoot without forcing prediction into being, as though it would be possible to place one’s affect on a kind of confident cruise control. The literary figures grow something like that: a historically capacious, neointuitive sense of becoming-present."

“At the same time, and crucially, the narrator notes that a catastrophe is just ‘what happens when you subtract what happens all the time.’ So the work of the novel is to put catastrophe back into the ordinary, which is where its protagonist has no choice but to live. It refuses the exceptionality of the traumatic event, even when that event appears to have its own aesthetic structure, but catastrophe has to involve the unraveling of form and the suffusion of effects throughout the historical field."

“In Pattern Recognition everyone is on the make to monetize affect and intimacy: advertising, filmmaking, viral marketing, recycling trash into desirable kitsch are just some of the relevant activities shaping global economic and political relations."

“Sometimes, Cayce has to remind herself, there are actual coincidences. But in the novel that is rarely so: the nervous system is always intuiting the incessant communication across beings and things that have being, and tracking their traversal across infinite points on the grid of encounter. Thus whatever potentiality exists in Pattern Recognition is not about pasts or futures."

“Yet Cayce is no modernist flaneuse, even when she is acting as one: the aleatory collection of experience is a monetized style, not a mode of being, in the contemporary moment of Pattern Recognition. You might say that the work of the plot is to enable Cayce to radicalize the wandering of the flaneuse: she genuinely detaches from the defense of a cosmopolitan intuitional style so that she might actually attach to particular persons and wander with them."

### IV. The Falling Man and the Screaming Man: Anonymity and Trauma

“the ways that affect has had a privileged place in the construction of the experience and redaction of the historical present."

“By being located so explicitly in the nervous system, while remaining more vernacular than technical about it, The Intuitionist and Pattern Recognition archive numerous ways of articulating intuitions of the present, engaging genres and modes of detection like empiricism, intuitionism, completism, progressivism, looking around, and checking things out in order to clarify the question of how to live with, catch up to, respond to, extend, interfere with, or mind the gap in the present moment that one lives singularly but in a shared way too."

“Cultural theorists do not usually think of trauma through the affective conventions of genre. Nor do they think about trauma as a style of responding to a happening, a style of mediating it into event. Nor, as genre, has it been recognized as having induced a periodizing norm for writing about the history of the rpesent, at least since the U.S. 1950s."

“the literature on the traumatic event has been dominated by a consensus that trauma detaches the subject from the historical present, sentencing its subjects to a terrifying suffusion of the past into something stuck in the subject that stands out ahistorically from the ordinary."

“The utility of thinking about ‘crisis ordinariness’ as that which is incited by the traumatic event is in its focus on the spreading of symbolizations and other inexpressive but life-extending actions throughout the ordinary and its situations of living on."

the footage depicts “the fantasy that, when people come together in desire, things are simple, and simplifying.” [me: how does this connect to the fantasmatic ends of the novels?]

“Recasting the traumatic event into an ordinary intensity suggests an entirely different model of the ways post-traumatic history and memory re-personalize the subject."

“Sovereign anonymity as a defense against wanting to be able to need or make a claim on the world and people in it produces a livable impasse for both protagonists. But in the end, facing the death of the illusion that their personality and history are grounds rather than habits multiplies histories, intensifies affects across the spectrum of negativity and positivity, creates scenes and confuses dreaming with living: it demands a deft improvisatory renaturalization of the evidence of ongoingness that constitutes the default historical present, the now of being in the world."

“Recalibrating the intuition requires for them a new psychogeography that remediates their singularity and their place in history—the ongoing present—and portends what’s imminent and immanent (love, theory) without following them through to materialize any potential transformation int he conditions of that history. Transformation is always in the language of the aftertime; what the novels want is to provide the sensorium for a reconceptualized present."

“Their suspension of a sensorium organized around the ongoing desperation of bad precarity shifts into an aleatory intuition of a better precarity that feels like openness. The novels thus resolve multiple scenarios of crisis and catastrophe in entirely irrational ways. The diminution of loneliness into openness stands for the solution to the crisis that was much bigger than that."


## Three: Slow Death: Obesity, Sovereignty, Lateral Agency

### I. Slow Death and the Sovereign

focus on “the ways we conceptualize contemporary historical experience, especially where that experience is simultaneously at an extreme and in a zone of ordinariness, where life building and the attrition of human life are indistinguishable, and where it is hard to distinguish modes of incoherence, distractedness, and habituation from deliberate and deliberative activity, as they are all involved in the reproduction of predictable life."

“Foucault’s phrasing is precise. Sovereignty ‘is not the right to put people to death or to grant them life. Nor is it the right to allow people to live or leave them to die. It is the right to take life or let live.’ Life is the a priori; sovereign agency signifies the power to permit any given life to endure, or not. But biopower, he argues, which does not substitute for but reshapes sovereignty, is the power to make something life or to let it die, the power to regularize life, the authority to force living not just to happen but to endure and appear in particular ways. The difference between sovereign agency under a regime of sovereignty and under a regime of biopower, then, can be thought of as a distinction between individual life and collective living on, where living increasingly becomes a scene of the administration, discipline, and recalibration of what constitutes health."

“sovereignty is an inadequate concept. Sovereignty, after all, is a fantasy misrecognized as an objective state: an aspirational position of personal and institutional self-legitimating performativity and an affective sense of control in relation to the fantasy of that position’s offer of security and efficacy…. It is also a distorting description of the political, affective, and psychological conditions in which the ordinary subjects of democratic/capitalist power take up positions as agents."

“even if we cede sovereignty to perpetuity as a fantasy that sustains liberty’s normative political idiom we need better ways to talk about a more capacious range of activity oriented toward the reproduction of ordinary life: from the burdens of contemporary compelled will that fuel everyday employment and household pressures, for example, to the pleasures of spreading-out activities like sex or eating, aleatory modes of self-abeyance that do not occupy time, decision, or consequentiality in anything like the sovereign registers of autonomous self-assertion."

“In this habit of representing the intentional subject, a manifest lack of self-cultivating attention can easily become recast as irresponsibility, shallowness, resistance, refusal, or incapacity; and habit itself can begin to look overmeaningful, such that addiction, reaction formation, conventional gesture clusters, or just being different can be read as heroic placeholders for resistance to something, affirmation of something, or a world-transformative desire."

“in the scene of slow death, a condition of being worn out by the activity of reproducing life, agency can be an activity of maintenance, not making; fantasy, without grandiosity; sentience without full intentionality; inconsistency, without shattering; and embodying, alongside embodiment."


### II. Conceiving the Genre of the Case

“In an ordinary environment, most of what we call events are not of the scale of memorable impact but rather are episodes, that is, occasions that frame experience while not changing much of anything."

“Often when scholars and activists apprehend the phenomenon of slow death in long-term conditions of privation, they choose to misrepresent the duration and scale of the situation by calling a crisis that which is a fact of life and has been a defining fact of life for a given population that lives that crisis in ordinary time. Of course this deployment of crisis is often explicitly and intentionally a redefinitional tactic, an inflationary, distorting, or misdirecting gesture that aspires to make an environmental phenomenon appear suddenly as an event, because as a structural or predictable condition it has not engendered the kinds of historic action we associate with the heroic agency a crisis implicitly calls for."

“since catastrophe means change, crisis rhetoric belies the constitutive point that slow death—or the structurally induced attrition of persons keyed to their membership in certain populations—is neither a state of exception nor the opposite, mere banality, but a domain where an upsetting scene of living is revealed to be interwoven with ordinary life after all, like ants discovered scurrying under a thoughtlessly lifted rock."

“We learned most recently from AIDS, after all, that the epidemic concept is not a neutral description; it’s inevitably part of an argument about classification, causality, responsibility, degeneracy, and the imaginable and pragmatic logics of cure."

“Serious and opportunistic social change agents alike flail away at the obesity endemic by amplifying moral and political urgencies in any and every possible register."

“The obesity epidemic is also a way of talking about the destruction of life, bodies, imaginaries, and enciroments by and under contemporary regimes of capital."

“What does it mean to consider the ethics of longevity when, in an unequal health and labor system, the poor and less poor are less likely to live long enough to enjoy the good life whose promise is a fantasy bribe that justifies so much exploitation? How do we think about labor and consumer-related subjectivities in the same moment, since, in my view, one cannot talk about scandals of the appetite—along with food, there’s sex, smoking, shopping, and drinking as sites of moral disapprobation, social policy, and self-medication—without talking about the temporality of the workday, the debt cycle, and consumer practice and fantasy?"

“Biopower operates when a hegemonic bloc organizes the reproduction of life in ways that allow political crises to be case as conditions of specific bodies and their competence at maintaining health or other conditions of social belonging; thus this bloc gets to judge the problematic body’s subjects, whose agency is deemed to be fundamentally destructive."

“Health itself can then be seen as a side effect of successful normativity, and people’s desires and fantasies are solicited to line up with that pleasant condition."

### III. Obesity’s Actuarial Rhetoric

“For the first time in the history of the world there are as many overfed as underfed people and, also for the first time in the history of the world, the overfed are no longer only the wealthiest and the underfed no longer the poor and starving."

“Aversion to fatness increases along with fatness."

“Thus partly at issue in the obesity crisis is the definition of adequate food, and the conflicting models of health. Is health a biological condition, the availability for work, or a scene of longevity?"

“morbidity, the embodiment toward death as a way of life, marks out slow death as what there is of the good life for the vast majority of American workers."

### IV. From Distributed Causality to Interruptive Agency

“Epidemiologists suggest that the lower one is on the socioeconomic scale, the less open one is to yet another shaming or even quasi-criminalizing lecture about diet from an institutional professions, even when she’s acting like a normative ‘mom,’ a First Lady; expertise has so often been used shamingly to confirm the social negativity of dominated populations that even good advice is appropriately viewed with suspicion."

“Food is one of the few spaces of controllable, reliable pleasure people have."

“Working life exhausts practical sovereignty, the exercise of the will as one faces the scene of the contingencies of survival. At the same time that one builds a life the pressures of its reproduction can be exhausting. Eating can be seen as a form of ballast against wearing out, but also as a counter-dissipation, in that, like other small pleasures, it can produce an experience of self-abeyance, of floating sideways…. Eating amid the work of the reproduction of contemporary life is best seen as activity releasing the subject into self-suspension."

“Is ‘having a life’ now the process to which one gets resigned, after dreaming of the good life, or not even dreaming? Is ‘life’ as the scene of reliable pleasures located largely in those experiences of coasting, with all that’s implied in that phrase, the shifting, diffuse, sensual space between pleasure and numbness?"

“In this scene, activity toward reproducing life is neither identical to making it or oneself better nor a mimetic response to the structural conditions of a collective failure to thrive, nor just a mini-vacation from being responsible—such activity is also directed toward making a less-bad experience. It’s a relief, a reprieve, not a repair."

### Coda: Cruel and Usual Nourishment

“for most, potentiality within the overwhelming present is less well symbolized by energizing images of sustainable life and less guaranteed by the glorious promise of bodily longevity and social security than it is expressed in regimes of exhausted practice sovereignty, lateral agency, and, sometimes, counterabsorption in episodic refreshment, for example in sex, or spacing out, or food that is not for thought."


## Four: Two Girls, Fat and Thin

### I. When You Wish Upon A Star

“It is usual to think of critical theory as dark, not as an optimistic genre, not only because, traditionally, it’s suspicious: but also since it creates so much exhausting anxiety about the value of even the ‘thinkiest’ thought. But the compulsion to repeat optimism, which is another definition of desire, is a condition of possibility that also risks having to survive, once again, disappointment and depression, the protracted sense that nothing will change and that no-one, especially oneself, is teachable after all."

“Misrecognition (méconnaissance) described the psychic process by which fantasy recalibrates what we encounter so that we can imagine that something or someone can fulfill our desire: its operation is central to the state of cruel optimism."

“for a long time now, Sedgwick argues, skepticism has been deemed the only ethical position for the intellectual to take with respect to the subject’s ordinary attachments. Even Adorno, the great belittler of popular pleasures, can be aghast at the ease with which intellectuals shit on people who hold to a dream. Dreams are seen as easy optimism, while failures seem complex. Sedgwick writes against the hermeneutics of suspicion on the grounds that it always finds the mirages and failures for which it looks: she find critics overdedicated to a self-confirming scene of disappointment. In this view the disappointed critic mistakes his act of negation for a performance of his seriousness; perhaps he also elevates his thought by disdaining anything that emanates a scent of therapy, reparation, or utopianism."

“I love the idea of reparative reading insofar as it is a practice of meticulous curiosity. But I also resist idealizing, even implicitly, any program of better thought or reading. How would we know when the ‘repair’ we intend is not just another form of narcissism or smothering will?… the overvaluation of reparative thought is both an occupational hazard and part of a larger overvaluation of a certain mode of virtuously intentional, self-reflective personhood."

“Stupid optimism is the most disappointing thing of all. By ‘stupid’ I mean the faith that adjustment to certain forms or practices of living and thinking—for example, the prospect of class mobility, the romantic narrative, normalcy, nationality, or a better sexual identity—will secure one’s happiness…. Here is a stupidity of mine: ‘History is what hurts,’ that motto of The Political Unconscious, is a phrase that I love. It resonates as truth; it performs a truth-effect in me. But because it is in the genre of the maxim, I have never tried to understand it."

### II. Did Somebody say Wish?

gorgeous reading of Mary Gaitskill’s Two Girls, Fat and Thin 

“Strongly ambivalent, then, these three powerful modes of repetition, negation, and optimism are associated with the cultivation of the senses as well: food, thought, and sex are comforting as well as risky and raw-making modes of engagement and exchange."

#### Pleasure #1: Food (for Thought)

“Forget the fat and calories: to live for one’s snack is to live by the rhythm of one’s own impulse for pleasure"

“That is to say the girls’ relation to eating is a scene, not a symptom: among other things, the practice of eating provides a way to negotiate one’s incoherence while not organizing a personality to compensate for it."

“In Two Girls, Fat and Thin any individual’s sustained emancipation from the hurt of history is unimaginable. History is what hurts because that which repeats in consciousness, that which gives the pleasure at least of self-continuity, is what the subject deems her history. She is what she continues to have been. Traumatically identified people in this sense can take a technical pleasure in their histories, insofar as their histories are what they have, their personal property."

#### Pleasure #2: (History Is What) Smarts

“The intellectual referent of the word ‘smart’ derives from its root in physical pain. Smartness is what hurts, or to say that something smarts is to say that it hurts—it’s sharp, it stings, and it’s ruthless."

“In this regard their overvaluation of the idea is akin to the pleasure of critical negation. The idea enables the girls to hold themselves, to embrace their own bodies at the pinnacle of their greatest humiliations. Their embodied cloaks of loneliness protect a cherished sense of bitter superiority and abjection."

“For both girls, though, being mental provides almost a rhythmic relief from being reactive that protects what they know (without knowing it) about the possibility of a better or less bad relation to enfleshment, epistemology, fantasy, and intimacy."

#### Pleasure #3: Sex

“Dorothy is happy: she has been idealized. That’s the end of sex for her. The memory stays perfect, before it fades."

“[Justine’s] femininity is all tied up with training in the excellence of survival against the odds, the uninevitability of happiness, the pain of bodily pleasure. In this sense sexual trauma only slightly exacerbates ordinary sexuality."

“In other words, these enacted desires for simplicity, flow, and normalcy, in short perversely allow into fantasy a certain conventional feminine rhetoric and sensorium, that from which they had been barred by their specific histories."

### Coda: Melodrama, after Trauma

“In short, the two girls are not exemplary traumatic subjects, or children, or women, or any kind of exemplary Subject of History, whether of nations, capitalism, or sexuality…. Economically more than comfortable, they have virtually no resources with which to escape the given world but themselves and books. It is entirely predictable that they would end up addressing the problem of living by diving inside their bodies and feelings."


## Five: Nearly Utopian, Nearly Normal: Post-Fordist Affect in La Promesse and Rosetta 

### I. Nearly...

“The ongoing prospect of low-waged and uninteresting labor is for Rosetta nearly utopian; it makes possible imagining living the proper life that capitalism offers as a route to the good life. That the route is a rut matters not to Rosetta: when the world exists between the routinized rut and the ominous cracks, she chooses the rut, the impasse."

“Yet this way of describing the cultivation of a world through recourse to impulse, gesture, and episodic improvisation does not take into account what we also see, that the creativity of the children keeps being rerouted to repeating some version of their parents’ perverse approximations of the normative good life. It is as though the children, knowing nothing but that index of projected happiness, were compelled to repeat attachment to the very forms whose failure to secure the basic dignities of ordinary existence is central to the reproduction of the difficulty of their singular stories and lived struggle on the bottom of class society in the first place."

“The ordinary, in La Promesse and Rosetta, is organized around the solicitation of children to the reproduction of what we should call not the good life but ‘the bad life’—that is, a life dedicated to moving toward the good life’s normative/utopian zone but actually stuck in what we might call survival time, the time of struggling, drowning, holding onto the ledge, treading water—the time of not-stopping."

“the citizen’s dissatisfaction leads to reinvestment in the normative promises of capital and intimacy under capital. The quality of that reinvestment is not political in any of the normative sense, though—it’s a feeling of aspirational normalcy, the desire to feel normal, and to feel normalcy as a ground of dependable life, a life that does not have to keep being reinvented. That feeling does not require any particular forms of living to stimulate it; nor does it depend on the flourishing of the forms of living to which it attaches. Optimism attaches to their mere existence."

“This is why exploitation is not what the children cast as the enemy. They want to be exploited, to enter the proletarian economy in the crummy service-sector jobs it is all too easy to disdain as the proof of someone’s loserdon or tragedy. The risk would be opting out of the game."

“The history of sentimentality around children that sees them as the reason to have optimism—for if nothing else, their lives are not already ruined—thus takes on an ethical, political, and aesthetic purchase in these films. The audience is obligated to side with the child’s will not to be defeated, even if the difference between defeat and all its others is the capacity to attach optimism for a less bad future to a blighted field of possibility."

“In the economic lifeworld of these films, citizens without capital and migrants with fake papers are in proximate, interdependent boats structurally and affectively. All might as well be called survivalists, scavengers bargaining to maintain the paradox of entrepreneurial optimism against defeat by the capitalist destruction of life."

“The question is not whether citizenship as a guarantee of social reciprocity is fantasmatic, but how, and in what fantasmatic registers, it operates as such."

“Both of these works thus end engendering in the audience a kind of normativity hangover, a residue of the optimism of their advocacy for achieving whatever it was for which the protagonists were scavenging."

“The end of mobility as a fantasy of endless upwardness, and the shift to the aspiration toward achieving an impasse and stop-loss, is a subtle redirection of the fantasy bribes transacted to effect the reproduction of life under the present economic conditions."

### II. Psychoanalysis, Ethics, and the Infantile

“From a certain political perspective, a feminist one, it has long been argued that love is a bargaining tool for convincing others to join in making a life that also provides a loophole through which people can view themselves nonetheless as fundamentally noninstrumental—selfless, sacrificial, magnanimous—in their intimacies. The code phrase for this loophole is the distinction between the public and the private…. The displaced relation within the capitalist subject between his instrumental persona and his loving persona enables him to disidentify with what’s aggressive in his pursuit of desire and interest in all spaces, and to see himself as fundamentally ethical because he means to have solidarity with some humans he knows."

“Self-transforming compassionate recognition and its cognate forms of solidarity are necessary for making political movements thrive contentiously against all sorts of privilege, but they have also provided a means for making minor structural adjustments seem like major events, because the theater of compassion is emotionally intense."

“In the scene of economic, national, and transnational life that has provided this essay’s case, love is only slightly less contingent than work."

“To see hegemony as domination and subordination is to disavow how much of dependable life relies on the sheerly optimistic formalism of attachment."

### III. Worlds of Pain

“the subordinated sensorium of the worker, whose acts of rage and ruthlessness are mixed with forms of care, is an effect of the relation between capitalism’s refusal of futurity in an overwhelmingly productive present and the normative promise of intimacy, which enables us to imagine that having a friend, or making a date, or looking longingly at someone who might, after all, show compassion for our struggles, is where living really takes place."


## Six: After the Good Life, an Impasse: Time Out, Human Resources, and the Precarious Present

### I. Always Now: Situation, Gesture, Impasse

focus on films that document “the shifting up of economic precarity into what Giorgio Agamben has called the new ‘planetary petty bourgeoisie’"

on the term “precariat”: “This emergent taxonomy raises questions about to what degree precarity is an economic and political condition suffered by a population or by the subjects of capitalism generally; or a way of life; or an affective atmosphere; or an existential truth about the contingencies of living, namely, that there are n o guarantees that the life one intends can or will be built."

“the increasing corrosion of security as a condition of life for workers across different concentrations of economic and political privilege."

“How this affective shift toward valuing lateral freedoms and creative ambitions over strict upward mobility will fare in the current economic crisis, amid expanding claims on the state and the frantic grasping to stay in labor as such, remains to be seen."

“the managers of capital and its service class are finding the threat of real vulnerability a crisis condition within the ordinary; their response to it has been fundamentally antidemocratic, producing at best gestural solidarities with other precarious populations."

“Cruel optimism or not, they feel attached to the soft hierarchies of inequality to provide a sense of their place in the world. The internal tensions between capitalism and democracy seem resolved as long as a little voting, a little privacy, and unimpeded consumer privilege prevail to prop up the sense that the good-life fantasy is available to everyone."

“This strange cohesion of neoliberal interest, psychoanalytic theory, and radical theoretical commitments to contingent conditions for the reinvigoration of social life suggests, in short, two things about contemporary precarity. One is that the precariat must be a fundamentally affective class, since the economic and political processes that put people there continue to structure inequalities according to locale, gender, race, histories of class and political privilege, available state resources, and skills. The other is that, in the affective imaginary of this class, adaptation to a sense of precarity dramatizes the situation of the present."

“a situation is a genre of living that one knows one’s in but that one has to find out about, a circumstance embedded in life but not in one’s control. A situation is a disturbance, a sense genre of animated suspension—not suspended animation."

“What makes the present historical moment a situation is not just that finally the wealthy are experiencing the material and sensual fragilities and unpredictability that have long been distributed to the poor and socially marginal. It is that adaptation to the adaptive imperative is producing a whole new precarious public sphere, defined by debates about how to rework insecurity in the ongoing present, and defined as well by an emerging aesthetic."

“The haunting question is how much of one’s creativity and hypervigilant energy the situation will absorb before it destroys its subjects or finds a way to appear as merely a steady hum of livable crisis ordinariness."

“The impasse is a space of time lived without a narrative genre. Adaptation to it usually involves a gesture or undramatic action that points to and revises an unresolved situation."

“Whatever else it is, and however one enters it, the historical present—as an impasse, a thick moment of ongoingness, a situation that can absorb many genres without having one itself—is a middle without boundaries, edges, a shape. It is experienced in transitions and transactions. It is the name for the space where the urgencies of livelihood are worked out all over again, without assurances of futurity, but nevertheless proceeding via durable norms of adaptation."

“If the precariat is an affective class, then for the formerly psychically and economically protected members of the precariat there has been at least one enduring and collectively binding loss—of the gestures that maintained the disavowals and contradictions that sustained so many social democratic good-life fantasies."

### II. “It’s normal to be a bit nervous”: Ressources humaines 

“in France the salient distinction is between jobs with status—that is, legally protected jobs—and jobs without status—that is, precarious, temporary, and episodic jobs…. The thirty-five-hour workweek has brought with it an increase of contract labor, a decrease in the power of unions, and a crisis in the terms of the national social contract, insofar as that contract is evidenced in economic policy."

“At a moment of fierce contestation between the interests of workers and capital, it is now possible to bracket or to claim as archaic long-standing debates about what it means for individuals, the masses, and the state to live democracy by asserting that everyone now lives capitalism in proximity to risk, threat, and ongoing anxiety at the situation that something autonomous called ‘life’ seems to present equally, everywhere. Competing precarities can morph in an instant to sound like grounds for solidarity."

“The bottom line here is that labor is not a casual space, and that to be a good worker is to be an anxious one."

“What makes this film’s scenario an emanation of the present moment is its performance of the becoming-archaic of the dreamscapes and gratifications of capitalist modernity, and of the fantasies that enabled everyday life to be lived in small doses of leisure that promise to become longer scenes of aged enjoyment.”

### III. Why Should You Be Spared?: L’Emploi du temps 

“the dedication of the state to fomenting neoliberal practices of interrupted accountability and fading meritocracy is a central context for the rise of a consultancy class that contracts to have episodic dealings as opposed to having institutionally shaped long-term relationships."

“the twentieth century witnessed the expansion of corporate demands that workers line up emotionall with workplace norms along with producing value adequately: responsibility and reciprocity came to require the performance of emotional compliance."

“In this sense Time Out revises deferred gratification for the precarious era. It no longer involves suffering in the present for future enjoyment, but simulated, improvised, scavenged enjoyment in a present beyond which there is nothing."


## Seven: On the Desire for the Political

### I. Affect, Noise, Silence, Protest: Ambient Citizenship

“Public spheres are always affect worlds, worlds to which people are bound, when they are, by affective projections of a constantly negotiated common interestedness. But an intimate public is more specific. In an intimate public one senses that matters of survival are at stake and that collective mediation through narration and audition might provide some routes out of the impasse and the struggle of the present, or at least some sense that there would be recognition were the participants in the room together."

“Amidst all of the chaos, crisis, and injustice in front of us, the desire for alternative filters that produce the sense—if not the scene—of a more livable and intimate sociality is another  name for the desire for the political. // This is why an intimate attachment to the political can amount to a relation of cruel optimism."

“The exhausting repetition of the politically depressed position that seeks repair of what may be constitutively broken can eventually split the activity of optimism from expectation and demand."

“What is the relation between the ‘Yes We Can!’ optimism for the political and how politics actually works? What is the effect of Obama’s optimization of political optimism against the political depression of the historically disappointed, especially given any President’s limited sovereignty as a transformative agent in political life?"

“maintaining solidarity requires skills for adjudicating incommensurate visions of the better good life. The atrophy of these skills is at risk when politics is reduced to the demand for affective attunement, insofar as the sense of belonging is threatened by the inconvenience of antagonistic aims. Add to this the possibility that ‘the political’ as we know it in mass democracy requires such a splitting of attachment and expectation. Splitting off political optimism from the way things are can sustain many kinds of the cruelest optimism."

### II. Sounding out the War

“Preaching to the choir is always undervalued. But, as a world-confirming strategy of address that performs solidarity and asserts righteousness, it is absolutely necessary to do. When an intimate public is secreted in its own noise, it rehearses affectively what the world will feel like when its vision gains mass traction. At the same time, though, the strength of any political movement depends on persevering in the face of the inevitable kinds of internal dissent that will put at odds people also bonded through critique. But perhaps reinforcing intimate binding is the main function of avant-garde counternormative political work."

“One of security culture’s open secrets is, as I have said, that there never were free sovereign subjects of politics or the market, but rather monitored subjects who are permitted to pass by and get on with things if their comportment does not go awry."

### III. Silence on the Record

“What statement would you put on the historical record if you got one shot at it?"

### IV. Works of Art in an Age of a Manifestly Unstable Collective Transition

“One response to political abandonment is to revolt, to fight the power in genres of direct action. The subjects of precarity that this book tracks have chosen primarily not to fight, but to get caught up in a circuit of adjustment and gestural transformation in order to stay in proximity to some aspirations that had gotten attached to the normative good life."

“It seems that all of the talking has already happened, and everyone is in survival time."

### V. Cruel Optimism and the Desire for the Political

“The compulsion to repeat a toxic optimism can suture someone or a world to a cramped and unimaginative space of committed replication, just in case it will be different."

“Facing the fact that no form of being in the political or politics—including withdrawing from them—will solve the problem of shaping the impasse of the historical present, what alternatives remain for remaking the fantasmatic/material infrastructure of collective life? Is the best one can hope for realistically a stubborn collective refusal to give out, wear out, or admit defeat? In that case, optimism might not be cruel at all, but the bare minimum evidence of not having given up on social change as such."

“this is what it means to take the measure of the impasse of the present: to see what is halting, stuttering, and aching about being in the middle of detaching from a wanting fantasy of the good life; and to produce some better ways of mediating the sense of a historical moment that is affectively felt but undefined in the social world that is supposed to provide some comforts of belonging, so that it would be possible to imagine a potentialized present that does not reproduce all of the conventional collateral damage."

“cruel optimism’s double bind: even with an image of a better good life available to sustain your optimism, it is awkward and it is threatening to detach from what is already not working."
