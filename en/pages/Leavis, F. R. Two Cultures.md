Leavis, F. R.  Two Cultures?  The Significance of C. P. Snow.  New York:  Pantheon, 1963.


(see also Lionel Trilling, _Commentary_ (June 1962)

Snow as "portentously ignorant" (Leavis 28) and significant in that he is being taken as a sage

"Snow is, of course, a -- no, I can't say that; he isn't:  Snow thinks of himself as a novelist" (Leavis 31)

"his 'literary culture' is something that those genuinely interested in literature can only regard with contempt and relative hostility.  Snow's 'literary intellectual' is the enemy of art and life" (Leavis 35)

"The upshot is that if you insist on the need for any other kind of concern, entailing forethought, action, and provision, about the human future -- any other kind of misgiving -- than that which talks in terms of productivity, material standards of living, hygiene and technological progress, then you are a Luddity" (Leavis 38)
