Hall, Stuart and Paddy Whannel. The Popular Arts. New York: Pantheon, 1965.


INTRODUCTION

“education” v. cultural and leisure interests

book trying to bridge gap between classroon and cultural theory

“The danger of going rapidly out of date could have been avoided by writing in more general terms, but this is precisely the approach which we believe to be least helpful.” (Hall and Whannel 14)

struggle between “good” and “shoddy” is “not a struggle against the modern forms of communication, but a conflict within these media” (Hall and Whannel 15)

PART ONE: DEFINITIONS

1. THE MEDIA AND SOCIETY

two social changes wreaking controversy in educational world:  1. the communications revolution (sound recording, film, radio, TV); 2. the “teenage revolution”

1st is connected to industrial revolution; 2nd connected to capitalism’s late phase, with high consumption and increased leisure

how these two processes interact: youth culture, etc.

media changing the world in ways important enough for their study to become part of formal education

media often felt as threat to traditional standards and values

erosion of old academic standards (class, race)

much of “entertainment” is shoddy and third-rate; but much of criticism levelled against it is misinformed and misdirected

one problem: clear definition of mass culture as separate from and opposed to “sophisticated” arts (“pop” vs. “good”); ideas of “mis-use” of mass media; what “right use” would be goes unstated — direct transmission of traditional values? — “the success of broadcasting should not be judged simply in terms of making the established works available to a wider audience but also by the achievement of people . . . who have used the medium in original ways” (Hall and Whannel 26)

in opposition to this: those willing to accept anything called “entertainment” but consider it foolish to use critical analysis on it; often springs from belief that we respond to art differently than life

divorce between art and life as distinction between “work” subjects and “recreative” subjects in ed.

“well-rounded-man” view of culture — involves separating moral values from aesthetic values

“cultural opportunism” — trying to bridge generation gap by embracing youth culture — “the danger for those who adopt this strategy is that in their anxiety not to be thought ‘square’ they will come to accept not merely the valid place of entertainment but the standards provided by publicity and the mass-production machine” (Hall and Whannel 29-30)

opportunism as modified version of idea of mass-culture’s threat to traditional culture

must reject hostile attitude, but must also reject uncritical acceptance; cannot separate moral from aesthetic qualities — “The values and moral attitudes are embodied in the style itself” (Hall and Whannel 31)

arguments that entertainment has little effect on us; evidence about the way the media affects attitudes and values; “Surely the value of art and entertainment is that it does affect us?” (Hall and Whannel 34)

what is meant by “mass media” or “mass communications”? Is it strictly a matter of numbers? — in the end, we are forced to create a qualitative definition based on critical judgements

“No one has yet come up with any way of ‘proving’ that The Third Man is bad and Crime and Punishment good.” (Hall and Whannel 36)

“What must be embraced by the term ‘mass culture’ is art that is machine-produced according to a formula” (Hall and Whannel 36) — formula “pre-digests” art for viewer

emphasis (re: pop culture in education) should be placed on a training in discrimination; must stop treating “high” and “low” as if they were competitive

Leavis’s comparisons of pre-industrial culture and mass-produced bulture are pessimistic and unuseful; “The old culture has gone because the way of life that produced it has gone.  The rhythms of work have been permanently altered” (Hall and Whannel 39) — link of culture with material life

resistance to analysis; must pay attention to style and form

2. MINORITY ART, FOLK ART, AND POPULAR ART

“The media are not the end-products of a simple technological revolution.  They come at the end of a complex historical and social process, they are active agents in a new phase in the life-history of industrial society.” (Hall and Whannel 45)

link between emergence of new art forms and social change

trying to break with the “false distinction” (Hall and Whannel 47) between “serious” and “popular”, etc.

Leavis: criticism as creative activity

standards claimed for the new media:  merely means of wider transmission of “high” culture?

adaptation: “There is not necessary connection between the quality of a work of art in one form and its quality in another.” (Hall and Whannel 48)

media as “agents of socialization” (Hall and Whannel 48)

new media as means of creating art

creative work in new media transforms our vision of the medium?

preceding two cases develop a relationship between media and “high culture”

Hall’s study focuses on film/TV work at the “level” of high cult, such as Buñuel, Antonioni, etc. ‚ maintains high/low distinction

culture v. entertaiment as durability v. expendability? (Hannah Arendt)

folk culture: did not resist time; dealt directly with the concrete world familiar to its audience; direct relationship between the performer and the audience (no real separation)

music hall as transitional form between “folk” and “popular”

“Where high art, today, is judged by its capacity to disturb and challenge us, the popular arts confirm — even reassure.” (Hall and Whannel 59)

drawing distinctions between popular and high

evolution from folk to popular: emergence of individual performs

development toward immediacy, spontaneity and novelty?

Daniel Bell: “the influence of cinematic technique has become so pervasive — the rapid cutting, the flashback, the interweaving of themes and break-up of sequence — as to overwhelm, almost, the novel as well” (quoted in Hall and Whannel 61)

popular art as very small proportion of what is produced by the mass media — “It is expressive of popular taste, but does not exploit it” (Hall and Whannel 65)

3. POPULAR ART AND MASS CULTURE

“It is through the popular artist and his art that some part of the values, attitudes and experiences of the common audience survives into and through the era of bourgeois individualism.” (Hall and Whannel 67)

typical product of mass media is not popular art, though popular art is usually found in mass media

distinction between popular art and “art” of mass media as distinction between two kinds of art: “art” of mass media as “corruption” of popular art (Hall and Whannel 68)

popular art exists only through personal style; mass art has no personal quality, but rather a high level of “personalization”; mass art destroys all individuality; personality as mere marketing technique — “image”

stylization and convention important in popular art; becomes stereotyping, formula, in mass art

mass art contains built-in audience responses? quotes Macdonald, Adorno, Hoggart

(is Hall simply trying to move some specific products of mass culture into the realm of high art, while leaving the categories undisturbed?)

reads sense of young people that high art is not for them as “hostility” — why not hostility of art toward young?

idea of freedom to choose high or low art ignores divisions of class and lines between culture and class

transformation of sense of deprivation into active hostility

Hannah Arendt: transformation of cultural values into exchange values

early film comedies “defended the underdog, burlesqued authority and inflicted indignity on the rich and pompous” (Hall and Whannel 76) — shows popular origins of film

popular quality of film now (1964) threatened from both sides: moving toward high art, on the one hand; the “blockbuster” shows decline into mass art, on the other

blockbuster “must be carefully and deliberately disinfected, as a matter of production policy, of any attitudes which might annoy anyone, anywhere” (Penelope Houston, quoted in Hall and Whannel 77)

“Modern media like the cinema, though so frequently misused, do have the potential for undermining the established hierarchies of culture, simply because they hold an effective bridgehead of communication between cultures or classes” (Hall and Whannel 78)

has Hannah Arendt’s gap between “culture” and “entertainment” narrowed?

Dwight Macdonald:  “midcult”

most significant connection between popular and high art in way the popular helps the serious artist focus the world

PART TWO: TOPICS FOR STUDY

4. POPULAR FORMS AND POPULAR ARTISTS

THE BLUES

blues as popular form in every sense except numbers

blues as moving from direct expression of “folk” to stories of “folks”

blues as form and feeling

Billie Holliday

THE WESTERN

most original and most enduring contribution of Hollywood

western as modern morality tale

“It is at the point where it refuses to make critical judgements that the inadequacy of the social or psychological approach is revealed.” (Hall and Whannel 102)

John Ford

5. VIOLENCE ON THE SCREEN

“There may certainly be some point in the complaint that there is too much traffic in violent themes.  But this complaint should be seen for what it is: a criticism of the balance of content in the media generally, and not a qualitative judgement on the particular kinds of violence treated, nor an informed opinion on their various effects.” (Hall and Whannel 110)

violence in cinema:  war movies

6. THE AVENGING ANGELS

pulp fiction; ex. Mickey Spillane

hard-boiled style; “the transcending of authority and accepted moral codes” (Hall and Whannel 143)

cannot discuss these novels in terms of their effects, but must deal with them on their own account

is the genre too decadent and corrupt?  1 or 2 writers “have managed the thriller novel without being defeated by it” (Hall and Whannel 155) — see Raymond Chandler

7. FALLING IN LOVE

romance: like thriller, a way in which contemporary experiences are set to work within the frame of fantasy

tension between middle-class morality (marriage) and romantic morality (often incl. adultery)

“heroic virtue” (Hall and Whannel 170); sentimentality in Victorian fiction

sacrifice of heroine to a code of honor only meaningful if living code; in modern thriller, see the collapse of code

“Love is not a passion here — it is a preoccupation.  There may be romances, but they lack romanticism.” (Hall and Whannel 186)

“Being ‘in love’ does not represent, as Denis de Rougemont would have us believe, a secret desire for passionate experience.  It represents, on the part of the heroine, a desire to fulfil an approved social role — that of being a girl friend.” (Hall and Whannel 187)

8. FANTASY AND ROMANCE

romance movies — the “pin-up” v. early film sexual images (Dietrich)

“It is perhaps in its handling of sexual themes that each national cinema most sharply reveals characteristic national attitudes.” (Hall and Whannel 198) — British sex farces v. American sex comedies

defense of American virginity — last minute rescue of the code

romantic comedy as film convention

differences between strong female characters in romance comedies of the 30s and those of 50s/60s — changing attitudes towards sex

typology of the stars

9. FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS

to refer to something as a “popular” medium is not simply a comment on the material it presents, but also on its relationship with the audience — see esp. TV

documentary TV (“reality” programming)

shift in meanting of word “image” from what is there to what is not (what is manufactured)

ability of TV to both present and falsify reality

“popular” press:  rise in 18th and 19th centuries of the “great unstamped” press

in mass communications, struggle for/breakdown of “family feeling”

attempts of mass media “to discover a genuine relationship, or to fabricate a phoney relationship, with the ‘people.’” (Hall and Whannel 233)

popular newspapers: tactics of the tabloid press;  TV

10. THE YOUNG AUDIENCE

in dealing with ‘teenage’ culture, difficult to maintain separation between media and audience

“the picture of young people as innocents exploited by the sharp merchants of Denmark Street has some truth in it, but is over-simplified.  We have a situation in some ways more similar to that of television, where the use intended by the provider and the use actually made by the audience of the particular style never wholly coincide, and frequently conflict.” (Hall and Whannel 269-70)

control over teenage culture exercised by industry

pop music (v. jazz)

11. THE BIG BAZAAR

advertising — can economic and cultural functions be separated?

trend in modern advertising away from information and towards persuasion

cultural/normative function

“The first task of modern advertising is to organize the market.” (Hall and Whannel 314) — demographics

advertising alienates production (work) from consumption

advertising as official art of capitalist society

advertising as appeal to values/desires

PART THREE: SOCIAL THEMES
12. THE INSTITUTIONS

organization and history of communications — film

most media financed by advertising; influence of advertisers over content

concentration of much media in few hands

communication has become one-sided; impossibility of answering back

FILM AS AN INDUSTRY

1. The main structure: three part structure:  production, distribution, exhibition; tendency toward monopoly

2. The audience: cinema-going highest among working classes, young; decline in audience attributable to spread of TV?

3. Effects of the decline: production of blockbusters to combat TV; emergence of independents; increased power of the monopolies; “It must be made clear therefore that the struggle is between two different sets of commercial interests and not between the independents who are only interested in art and the circuits only interested in money.” (Hall and Whannel 351)

4. Government intervention: the quota; the British Film Fund Agency; National Film Finance Corp.

5. Changing pattern: decline of Hollywood

6. Film finance

more fundamental question: intellectual attitudes to cinema

13. MASS SOCIETY: CRITICS AND DEFENDERS

characteristics of the “new” mass society, considering the views of the providers, the traditionalists, the progressives, and the radicals

the general indictment of mass society:  1. power: too concentrated, ethics of salesmanship infecting every area of life, “Persuasion has been substituted for debate and the search for the right image has replaced the search for the right policy.” (Hall and Whannel 366); 2. mass production: formula allows no place for creativity; 3. consumers: people no longer participants in society, but consumers, people as “‘masses’ awaiting exploitation” (Hall and Whannel 366); 4. the pseudo-world: stereotypes, come to believe more in pictures of life than in life itself; 5. the unambiguous world: mass culture makes us more alike, obliterates distinctions of quality; 6. the break with the past: mass culture has no traditions/is tradition-destroying, obsession with novelty; 7. corruption of the feelings: media exploits rather than satisfies desires, appeals to worst instincts; 8. the flattery of mediocrity: ‘tyranny’ of the Common Man; 9. the cult of personality: substitute for true individuality; 10. escape from reality: audience receives mass media in state of “dream-like passivity” (Hall and Whannel 369)

other points of view:  1. the providers: owners/senior controllers; resort to commercial terms; argue that the media are democratic, “giving the people what they want” (Hall and Whannel 371) — but this offers a mechanistic supply-and-demand model of communications, and equates the “people” with the majority, which puts too much emphasis on ratings; also assumes two kinds of audience, low- and high-brow, but the minority is not necessarily high-brow

2. the traditionalists: attack modern society for its break with past; see Eliot and Leavis — Eliot as classist, anti-democratic; Leavis as anti-industrialist

3. the progressives: more optimistic, see problems as products of transitional phase; dispute “passivity” of film/TV viewing as opposed to reading; “The assumption that the hidden values revealed by the intellectual critic somehow get through to people in a submerged form may not be true.” (Hall and Whannel 379)

4. the radicals: believe guardians of culture try to exclude others; believe value and merit have been dangerously mixed; see society in conflict, not evolving; see conflict between democracy and commercialism — wants state control for freedom of all; while progressive wants plurality of cultures, radical wants common culture

PART FOUR: EDUCATION

14. THE CURRICULUM AND THE POPULAR ARTS
