LeClair, Tom.  In the Loop:  Don DeLillo and the Systems Novel.  Urbana:  U of Illinois P, 1987.


Preface:  In the Loop.

“‘In the Loop’ refers outward — to DeLillo’s novels as artifacts and to the cultural materials they enclose — and inward to the process in which you, reader, are now participating, the process of academic literary criticism.  Written by a professor, published by a university press, directed primarily to other academics, In the Loop has as one of its subjects just this small communications loop and why Don DeLillo’s fiction has largely been excluded from it.” (LeClair ix)

“DeLillo’s work has an unusual deconstructive and reconstructive usefulness.  It possesses the power to reach general readers, those mass consumers of culture, with a precise diagnosis of and affective alternative to precisely those conditions of our consumer culture that threaten to consume us, not just us professors or us readers or us Americans, but all of us members of the ecosystem, that encompassing reciprocal loop that is DeLillo’s fundamental model of value.” (LeClair x)

LeClair’s interests lie, among other places, in “the metafictional games and commentaries he produces, especially his defense of writing about the world in and age he sees as increasingly nonliterary” (LeClair xi)

“the fundamental subjects of DeLillo’s fiction — communication loops ranging from the biological to the technological, environmental to personal, linguistic, prelinguistic, and postlinguistic, loops that are both saving and destroying, evolutionary spirals and vicious circles, feedback variation and mechanistic repetition, elegant ellipses and snarling complications.” (LeClair xi)

D’s fiction “is influenced by and parallels the ideas of ‘systems theory,’ a contemporary scientific paradigm that concentrates on the reciprocal — looping — communications of ecological systems (including man).  Systems theory offers an alternative to both the cruel ‘certitudes’ of mechanistic thinking and the extremes of relativity” (LeClair xi)


1.  Introduction:  Systems Theory, the Systems Novel, and Don DeLillo

“‘Systems theory’ is a ‘fresh intelligence,’ a new thinking created to help prevent apocalypse, either quick or slow, by understanding in a profound and useful way DeLillo’s hyphenated concept of ‘man-planet,’ the living, intelligent ecosystem threatened by the system planner’s ‘art’ — his reduction of life to entities in motion — and by other dangers that DeLillo and the other ‘systems novelists’ present in their fictions.” (LeClair 2)

sources:  Ludwig von Bertalanffy in biology, who drew inspiration from Leibniz, Hegel, Marx, Hesse, Kohler

“About the information theory of Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver and the cybernetics of Norbert Weiner, both of which were developing ideas about feedback at about the same time that he was expressing his biology-based ideas about reciprocal communication loops, von Bertalanffy was rather sensitive, claiming that what came to be called cybernetics was an independent and parallel development that could be and was usefully assimilated into ‘systems theory’.” (LeClair 3)

“‘Systems theory’ is best understood as a set of assumptions about nature and as an interpretive methodology — as a metascience, rather than as a scientific discipline with its own rules of experimentation and proof.  The subjects of systems theory are all living systems, including social systems, and the specialized disciplines that study them.  Systems theory has as its purposes to understand the fundamental and particular processes of life, to find the essential relations among sciences that isolate parts of the ecosystem for study, and to provide a new paradigm for thinking about reality.  The method of systems theory is twofold.  In its approach to living systems it is mathematical and speculative, a hypothetical model-building; in its approach to scientific discourses it seeks to identify what von Bertalanffy calls isomorphisms or homologies, formal similarities and differences among systems of notation.  The language of systems theorists is often abstract and sometimes invented as they attempt to reconceive the world without the epistemological separation of subject and object that is encoded in ordinary language.” (LeClair 3)

central theses to von Bertalanffy’s “new vision”:  “— Because living systems are dynamic processes that combine energy and information in reciprocal relations, the systems are not separable into parts but must be considered as wholes. 
— Mechanistic principles used to analyze closed systems of entities in linear chains of cause and effect cannot adequately describe the circular causality of living systems, which are open and interacting with other systems.
— Defined as ‘organized complexity,’ these open systems also resist mechanistic study because it attends to the atomistic and reductive elements of reality.
— The nature of living systems is found primarily in differentiation of structure and form, in these carriers of information rather than in the exchange of energy and force.
— The processes of open systems are ‘equifinal’:  end results cannot be determined or predicted from initial conditions as mechanism claimed for its experiments.
— Living, open systems are goal-seeking, self-organizing, and self-correcting, tending toward homeostasis (or equilibrium), which contrasts with the thermodynamic model of closed systems and increasing entropy.  (This concept — homeostasis — is the one most modified by later systems thinkers.)
— The optimum condition of a system exists when it has variety in its information and flexibility for adaptation.
— The privileged model of the living system is the ecosystem, which as a whole is beyond any experimental conditions.
Several methodological principles follow from these fundamental assumptions:
— The observer or theorist, unlike the physicist who stands apart from his experiment, is part of the system under investigation and is therefore limited to what von Bertalanffy called ‘perspectivism.’ [end 4]
— The either/or logic of mechanism is inadequate for the both/and relations — the simultaneity — of living systems.
— The isomorphisms or homologies in seemingly unrelated systems are relations, physically nonlocatable.
— The description of living systems requires a hierarchy of abstraction, logical types, or frames within frames to represent wholes within wholes.” (LeClair 4-5)

“Early on von Bertalanffy welcomed the computer as a device for creating sophisticated mathematical simulations to be used by systems theorists, but in recent years the tool has increasingly become the object of study, the computer revolution pushing to the periphery (at least in the popular mind) the larger inquiry von Bertalanffy thought it would serve.” (LeClair 5)

AI brings cybernetics and information theory to the fore

critics of systems theory argue that “the major result of systems theory is its use by political or corporate hierarchies to control economic or social systems” (LeClair 5); see Robert Lilienfield, The Rise of Systems Theory:  An Ideological Analysis

“Systems theory contributes, first, a critique of and an alternative to the faith in scientific mastery that has dominated Western thought since Descartes; second, a reversal of the pessimism accompanying the thermodynamic formulation of closed systems and entropy; third, a recognition of information and communication as constituents of the biosphere; and fourth, a foundation, rooted neither in historical cultural practices nor in materialistic science for a political critique of contemporary culture.” (LeClair 6)

Ilya Prigogine, Order Out of Chaos:  entropy “may lead to a new, more differentiated, higher, and ‘negentropic’ level of organization that Prigogine calls a ‘dissipative structure’” (LeClair 6)

Jeremy Campbell, Grammatical Man; Michel Serres, Hermes:  Literature, Science, Philosophy

“Frank Webster and Kevin Robins, in Information Technology:  A Luddite Analysis, provide a comprehensive political critique of information and communications technology” (LeClair 7)

others influenced by systems theory:  “Johann Von Neumann in game theory, Walter Buckley in sociology, Kenneth Boulding in economics, R. D. Laing in psychiatry, Alvin Toffler in futurology, Buckminster Fuller in everything, Gregory Bateson in anthropology, and Anthony Wilden in cultural criticism” (LeClair 7)

influence on novel, which Hassan takes to support a logic of unmaking:  “While these extraliterary influences surely help explain some of contemporary fiction’s deconstructive qualities, I would argue that if one sees the influence of systems theory on some of the authors and novels that Nadeau, Thiher, and Porush treat, the books’ deconstructive qualities — fragmentation or self-consciousness, for examples — can be recontextualized, understood as preliminary or diagnostic devices, not final negations but aspects of a larger reconstructive impulse.” (LeClair 8)

in contrast with quantum mechanics, language analysis, and cybernetics: “Systems theory is a more truly contemporary paradigm, and a more relevant one to humankind, than the now rather old ‘new’ physics.  While taking into account the arbitrariness of the language game, systems theory is enabled rather than crippled by linguistic relativity.  Systems theory also subsumes the seemingly dangerous discipline of cybernetics by illustrating that the information, communication, and control treated in cybernetics are the processes of all life, not just of machines.” (LeClair 9)

systems theory appeals to novelist by making use of “future-shock” experiences:  “the accelerating specialization (and alienation) of knowledge and work; the tremendous growth of information and communications media into mass markets and the attendant reductiveness of messages into commodities; large-scale geopolitical crises over energy and exchange (of goods, information, and money); and the growing awareness of planetary ecological threats produced by man yet now seemingly beyond his control.” (LeClair 9-10)

“The themes of systems theory are the master subjects of literary modernism — process, multiplicity, simultaneity, uncertainty, linguistic relativity, perspectivism — but in a new, larger scale of spatial and temporal relations (the ecosystem) that reflects the new scale of sociopolitical experience, including the rise of multinational corporations and global ecology.” (LeClair 10)

systems theory enables authors to escape deterministic, fatalist trajectories and instead create reconstructive loops

“In its methodology, systems theory offers the novelist a contemporary model for hypothetical formulations of whole, the finding and creating of homologies and formal equivalents in dense bodies of living data.” (LeClair 11)

systems theory enables the novelist to revive the “masterpiece,” which was killed off by postmodern uncertainty:  “systems theory could provide an example of a doubled or split relation to the idea of mastery, criticizing man’s attempt to master his ecosystem and yet, in its own synthetic act, ‘mastering’ various specialties in large abstractions in order to communicate beyond specialties.” (LeClair 11) — at the same time, however, systems theory admits its own limitations

“Systems theory is thus a science of ambitious uncertainty, anti-reductive, an exemplar of its own assertions about open and equifinal systems — and therefore an attractive model for writers who would attempt to continue the modernist tradition of synthetic masterpieces” (LeClair 11)

return to long book as resistancce to “the media’s miniaturization of historical experience and the postmodernists’ abandonment of it” (LeClair 12)

John Barth’s LETTERS as systems novel

Gaddis’s JR depicts a world in “what systems theorists call ‘runaway.’ In the runaway, positive feedback (which can be summed up as ‘The more you have the more you get of the same’) rules with no corrective, with no governor or negative feedback in the control loop.  The result is eventual self-destruction of the system.” (LeClair 13)

Pynchon also depicts runaway — see quote that compares living inside the system to a runaway bus (GR 412)

see also Coover, The Public Burning

biographical info on DeLillo; Italian-Catholic heritage may explain his interest in “mystery”

on the dualisms generated by Catholicism:  “DeLillo’s intellectual loops are a way to destroy these dualisms, but the loops’ final effect — and the effect he wants his fiction to have — is the mystery that Catholic theology ultimately asserts.” (LeClair 14)

“Living in the consumer economy that Marcuse describes, DeLillo shares Jameson’s belief that ‘the profound vocation of the work of art in a commodity society [is] not to be a commodity, not to be consumed, to be unpleasurable in the commodity sense.’  For DeLillo, the counterbalance to both power and consumption is ‘mystery,’ the single most important value-word in his fiction, nonfiction, and interviews.” (LeClair 15, quoting Jameson, Marxism and Form 395)

“The books are themselves systems, inherently mixed and uncertain, anti-reductive, open and equifinal like the systems described within them.  The critic who does not understand the nature of systems may find the novels’ uncertainty equivalent to despair....  The essential message of a system novel, knowledgeably read, is rather different:  warning against the destructive ‘runaway’ of civilization, the novel itself — in its intricacy and equifinality — manifests possibility, futurity.  Systems novels are themselves about processes of communication, and they take great risks to communicate a new version of the world.” (LeClair 19-20)

“Revulsion for publicity creates publicity.  The less a writer is visible, the more he is pursued.  In the communications loop, as system theorists note, silence is a message.  Fleeing public life, the writer may be unable to imagine it except as a source of paranoia.  Or, deeper yet, the conditions necessary for writing can become the novelist’s subjects:  purification, obsession, secrecy, silence — themes that jostle in DeLillo’s novels with the messages and noise of communications.” (LeClair 21)

history of recent criticism of contemporary fiction;  excesses of Klinkowitz’s Literary Disruptions (focus on the new, on the negative) led to conservative backlash:  see John Gardner, On Moral Fiction; Gerald Graff, Literature Against Itself; John Aldridge, The American Novel and the Way We Live Now; Charles Newman, The Postmodern Aura

see also Klinkowitz, Self-Apparent Word, and Caramello, Silverless Mirrors, both of which use Derrida to defend deconstructive self-reflexivity

deconstruction as a method tends to ignore the creative possibilities of orders and systems:  “Contemporary academics choose to isolate disorder (the negations, deconstructions, and apparent entropy of some recent fiction), rather than to study disorder and order together (deconstruction and regeneration).” (LeClair 24) — suggests that this is the reason for DeLillo’s exclusion from such studies

2.  Art of the Double Bind:  Americana

Bateson/Laing’s analysis of family structure and schizophrenia resulting from the family double-bind

“the difficulty of knowing one’s paradoxical personal past is both — again, paradoxically — lessened and magnified by our investigative devices, our ability to gather masses of information and then resist some univocal sorting...  As is often the case in systems novels, this difficulty also seems reversible:  cultural investigation and artistic creation are fraught with the dangers of the individual’s incorporating family mysteries, of projecting unconscious duplications.” (LeClair 37)

“A system of information imitates a system of entities because television exists primarily to serve an economy of commodity consumption.” (LeClair 47)

“Ruled out of television’s monolithic message system and the test track, just as they are ignored in the Bell household, are mysterious, complex, and possibly disturbing communications.” (LeClair 47) — see Warburton

“Sensitized to art’s imitation of life and life’s imitation of art, Bell seems to miss life’s duplication of life.  Perhaps this is the most dangerous result of existing in an artifice-ridden, forever looping environment.” (LeClair 48)

“America is a chaos, DeLillo implies, not of multiplicity but of what Herbert Marcuse called ‘one-dimensionality,’ a society in which the ‘productive apparatus tends to become totalitarian,’ obliterating ‘the opposition between the private and public existence, between individual and social needs.  Technology serves to institute new, more effective, and more pleasant forms of social control and social cohesion.” (LeClair 49, quoting Marcuse xv)

“DeLillo’s nearly constant rhetorical strategy:  offering the reader a safe and pleasurable genre that the author inverts to ‘madness’” (LeClair 51)

systems novelists as “double-binding artists, willing to have their novels participate in what they criticize, both working with and reversing readers’ conventional expectations” (LeClair 51)

“The major aesthetic conflict in Americana is not, however, between different kinds of language but between writing and film, a conflict that for DeLillo precedes the composition of the novel and extends through many of his later books.” (LeClair 52)

“DeLillo recognizes in Americana... the force that film and television exert in the communications loop.” (LeClair 52)

see Anything Can Happen interview:  “It’s movies in part that seduced people into thinking the novel was dead.  The power of the film image seemed to be overwhelming our little world of print.  Film could do so much.  Print could only trot across the page” (ACH 85) — Don DeLillo, “Interview” in Anything Can Happen:  Interviews with Contemporary American Novelists, ed. Tom LeClair and Larry McCaffrey (Urbana:  U of Illinois P, 1983)

“Brand’s excited description of shooting moving targets in Vietnam furnishes an analogy with the satisfaction of shooting motion with the movie camera.” (LeClair 53-54)

“As semioticians have been recently pointing out, experiencing film requires learning numerous codes; since these codes are close to the acts of ‘natural’ visual perception, the filmgoer can easily forget — can easily be encouraged to forget — that the two-dimensional screen image artificially represents and signifies.” (LeClair 54)

David’s turn from film to writing as an expiation of guilt, a sacrifice, and yet:  “Language is a mediation, too, but if there is a unique self beneath the conditioning and duplications of culture, and if that self has been largely formed (as Bateson suggests) by linguistic exchange, the writer’s medium burrows deeper toward the self.” (LeClair 55)

“DeLillo distrusts the search for primal origin, the first cause that would destroy the reciprocal loop.  He distrusts, too, the nature of language — its linearity, its limitations in expressing nonverbal forms of cognition and communication, its propagandistic repetition for and by a consumer culture.  Nevertheless, the continual balancing in language between the concrete and the abstract makes it superior to film’s inherent concreteness.” (LeClair 55-56)

“DeLillo uses a first-person, self-reflexive, and frequently unreliable narrator, a method more conducive to the novel than to film because of the camera’s built-in illusion of objectivity.” (LeClair 56)

3.  Deconstructing the Logos:  End Zone

“the central issues of End Zone:  how religious authority becomes secular power, out of which grows nostalgia for ritual and some apocalyptic absolute; how the recognition of circularity in linguistic and ecological systems subverts destructive absolutism; and how the creation of mystery must become the artist’s function in an environment of authoritarian, simplifying messages” (LeClair 59)

focus on the “language game” — see Wittgenstein, Derrida

sports novel = “the book as television set” (EZ 112)

4.  Crowds, Power, and Force:  Great Jones Street

“In Great Jones Street he focuses on social systems, concentrating on the relations between mass entertainment and political organization, issues of commerce, conditioning, consumption, and control.” (LeClair 89)

Elias Canetti, Crowds and Power

disconnection of telephone does not wholly undermine the communications network:  “in the communications loop, even silence is a message, the message that there is no message, and a form of power to which other characters respond” (LeClair 102-103)

5.  A New Map of the World:  Ratner’s Star

RS imagined as a book “that would be naked structure.  The structure would be the book and vice versa.” (LeClair 112, quoting ACH 86)

“Unfortunately, DeLillo’s most theoretically sophisticated and intellectually demanding book has also received little engagement or understanding from academic critics who, if they write on DeLillo at all, usually dodge the monster that hulks at the center of his career.” (LeClair 113)

“The art of excess as practiced by DeLillo and other systems novelists works when the reader realizes that what is too much for one set of expectations is appropriate and functional for another set, when one paradigm is deconstructed and another reconstructed in its place.  In the systems novel, the linear arrow of time and space bends into a loop.” (LeClair 121)

6.  A Double Life:  Players and Running Dog

two novels together form reciprocal “double loop” that suggests they are meant to be companion pieces:  “Novels are read one by one and are judged as discrete objects.  The continuous connections of DeLillo’s fiction suggest that evaluation of a writer’s work might best be based on the whole, rather than on the sum of his career’s parts.” (LeClair 146)

systems perspective for these novels provided by anthropology; both novels explore the consequences of the body/mind split

7.  Crossing Hemispheres:  The Names

flourishing of the realist international novel in the 1980s as reaction against the metafictionists of the 1970s; “What distinguishes The Names among these international novels — and most other fictions of the 1980s — is its simultaneity:  DeLillos creates consistently enriching reciprocal relations between the transcultural observations of the New Realists and the semiotic skepticism of the metafictionists.  In The Names a wide world both demands and resists linguistic mapping; the limitations of language have their causes and effects in that world, not just in the literary text.” (LeClair 177-78)

systems of movement, travel, space — continuum from air travel to walking

“For DeLillo, the issues illustrated by the continuum of transport, as well as by the novel as a whole, are these:  How does contemporary man become equal to the connections he has discovered and created, the new scale of magnitude in geography and information, while still preserving older, perhaps humanly necessary intimacies with places, people, and himself?” (LeClair 184)

“He betrays no nostalgia for the primitive in The Names; rather, he calculates what is both gained and lost as man changes his means of crossing spaces and, in so doing, changes himself.” (LeClair 185)

“If travel is a way to know space and constructions are a way to make it human, both motives obtain in communication, that of covering space that most directly manifests the systems orientation and metafictional aspects of The Names.  At one end of the communications continuum is essentially silent physical activity that sends messages.  This modulates into noise of various kinds; noise turns into silent codes, such as pictures and writing.  Each location along the spectrum offers a different combination of intimacy and information, concrete contact and abstract formulation, ambiguity and precision.” (LeClair 187) — note that LeClair intends “noise” in the sense of sound, not in the information-theory sense

Walter Ong, Orality and Literacy

Owen Brademas’s description of writing’s purpose as “subdue and codify” (N 80) is also the purpose of the cult, who use “the implements of early writers — sharp blades and hammers” (LeClair 192) to effect their murders

“Recognized as terrorists of textuality, agents of literacy’s mastery and alienation infiltrating oral cultures, the cult is, I believe, a profound diagnostic symbol of the imperialism of print, which has deeper and longer-lasting effects than religious missionaries or economic adventurers.” (LeClair 194)

analog v. digital worlds:  east = analog, right brain, oral; west = digital, left brain, literate; Greece = link between two

“In the style and form of The Names, but mostly in its analogue structures, DeLillo criticizes a reductive kind of realism while performing a referential and imaginative act, balances narrative self-awareness with large knowledge of the world.  His career began with a defense of the fictional text:  as an alternative to the power of visual media in Americana and the force of the performing arts in Great Jones Street, as a model of language itself in End Zone.  In his next three novels DeLillo’s confidence seemed to wane.  In Ratner’s Star he imitated an extraliterary model, and in Players and Running Dog he manipulated subgenres to show what had been left out of them.  When his travels made him aware of the new global power to be recorded and resisted, DeLillo in The Names returns to his earlier confidence in fiction’s digital methods, but he also measures fiction’s analog failures.” (LeClair 204-205)

8.  Closing the Loop:  White Noise

“White Noise is about ‘closing the loop’ — personal and mass dying, the ‘circle slowly closing’ (241) of fear producing its object, and the closed-in structures man erects for safety.” (LeClair 207)

novel is itself tightly looped and closes a loop in D’s career, coming back to Americana

“While the university in White Noise is presented as trivialized by the nostalgic study of popular and youth culture, Gladney’s children are making his family a center of learning.  The irony of this inverted situation is that the professor and his teacher-wife attempt to resist knowledge and regress into nostalgia while their children, despite their fears, move forward and outward into the Age of Information, into awareness of large, complexly related systems.” (LeClair 209) [but the family is also the source of all misinformation???]

“At one level, the media offer Babette and Jack a soothing background noise, evidence beneath their conscious threshold that they are connected to a mass of other listeners.  However, when Jack scrutinizes television, he concludes that it causes ‘fears and secret desires’ (85) — despite the fact that most of the fragments to which Jack attends are bits of information, rather than seductive image-creations of the kind described in Americana.” (LeClair 217)

“DeLillo gathers into Blacksmith and the novel numerous background characters from various races and nations, with different languages and religions, mostly non-Western and exotic-seeming people whose presence questions the white American noise patterns and values within which the Gladneys would conceal themselves.” (LeClair 218)

on Murray:  “Siskind is also, in Michel Serres’s systemic terms, the ‘parasite,’ the guest who exchanges talk for food and (simultaneously, in French) the agent of noise in a cybernetic system.” (LeClair 221)

“While satirizing how contemporary man uses and is used by his objects, his things, DeLillo also shows how a new perception of what is now natural — systems among systems, communications, inherent uncertainty, mysteriousness — can accommodate man to his condition as knower and even squeeze a modicum of hope from the junk into which a reductionist way of knowing has historically converted natural complexity.” (LeClair 299-30)

on Dylar:  “Is fiction a drug?  Does it merely relieve our mortal fear by allowing us to evade ourselves for a time, giving us a sense of mastery over the textual world and the text itself?” (LeClair 232)

“What can be recognized by reviewers and academics, and what this study ultimately points toward, is the crucial, encompassing question to which DeLillo’s sensibility responds and which his fiction, along with the works of other systems novelists and systems theorists, asks:  Do our thinking and behavior and fictions correspond to all that we do know, and can know, about living systems and how they survive?” (LeClair 235)
