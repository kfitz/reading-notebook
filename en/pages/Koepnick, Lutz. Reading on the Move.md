- counters arguments about decline of reading with a turn toward thinking about how we read in new forms; with respect to audiobooks, he argues, we read with the body
- argues that, rather than declining, reading has "accelerated tremendously" over the last two decades: "no age has written and read more than the one nursed on text messaging, Twitter, and Facebook. And no age has witnessed a quickening in the production, delivery, and consumption of written text comparable with the one launched by today’s compulsive digital connectivity and its stress on unconditional instantaneity and co-temporality" (233); focus on acceleration rather than decline permits an exploration of how we read
- "instead of asking, Does the flux and noise of digital culture destroy the conditions for good reading?, let me ask what I consider more productive—and more challenging—questions: How does the mobility of reading today change our concept of reading? What does it add to our understanding of how we read in the first place? And how does it invite us to see and revaluate past reading practices in a new light?" (234)
- "With the audiobook, the consumption of text enters the age of unconditional and unapologetic multitasking…. To listen to audiobooks is to experience the ingestion of text as a kinesthetic activity, one that at any moment may unsettle our perception of our bodies’ boundaries or sensory extensions into the world…. As they commingle the private and public attributes of reading and ask us to shuttle between different diegetic worlds, audiobooks remind us of the extent to which bodies are the primary media of perception and experience, of being in and reading the world." (235)
- "Audiobooks liquefy the rhetoric that modern culture has devoted to the authority of work and author." (235)
- audiobooks "cause us to reconsider our very notion of attention, of what it means to focus on something; they teach us how to sense our sensing and relate a text’s complex temporality to the sensorimotor operations of our bodies; they invite us to explore the difficult pleasures of negotiating the gray zone between words and worlds, mobility and the imagination" (237)
