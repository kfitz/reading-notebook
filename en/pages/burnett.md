# Burnett, Ron. *How Images Think*. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2004.

## Introduction

"Images are no longer just representations or interpreters of human actions.  They have become central to every activity that connects humans to each other and to technology -- mediators, progenitors, interfaces -- as much reference points for imformation and knowledge as visualization of human creativity.  However, the relationship between human beings and the cultural artifacts they use and create is by no means direct or transparent" (Burnett xiv)

"_How Images Think_ explores the rich intersections of image crteation, production, and communication within this context of debate about the mind and human consciousness.  In addition, the book examines cultural discourses about images and the impact of the digital revolution on the use of images in the communications process" (Burnett xiv-xv)

"It, as I often mention in _How Images Think_, interpretations about the impact of technologies on humans flow from reductive notions of mind and thought, it is largely because I believe that consciousness cannot solely be understood in an empirical fashion" (Burnett xvi)

"From a cultural perspective, it becomes easy to talk about the relationships that viewers, users, and audiences develop with images through simplified notions of stimulus and effect.  These reductive notions have been particularly powerful in discussions of new media and interactive technologies as well as with respect to computer games" (Burnett xvii)

"This book examines the power of these metaphors and what they say about the relationships that humans develop with the images that surround them" (Burnett xvii)

"_How Images Think_ also explores the technological context within which images operate and from which they gain their legitimacy.  This raises the further question of how images think.  In a *literal* sense, images do not think.  However, a great deal of intelligence is being programmed into technologies and devices that use images as their main form of interaction and communicatons" (Burnett xviii)

"I use the term *image* to refer to the complex set of interactions that constitute everyday life within image-worlds" (Burnett xviii)

"The boundaries separating humans from their technological creations have beccome thinner and thinner" (Burnett xix)

"This means that the newer technologies of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries are no longer just extensions of human abilities and needs; they are enlarging cultural and social preconceptions of the relationships between body and mind" (Burnett xix)

"I am not suggesting that the human body is just 'information.' At a number of points in this book I critique that very idea. However, the metaphors of body as information are very powerful and cannot be dismissed" (Burnett xix)

"The ubiquity of computers means that they are increasingly being anthropomorphized, which for me is one of the best examples of the symbiotic relationships that humans have with their technological creations.  My impulse throughout _How Images Think_ is to examine the many different cultural manifestations of these integrative phenomena.  As wary as I am of utopian claims about new media and new technologies, this book explores the cultural and technological transformations that are redefinign the relationships humans have developed with information, images, communications, and knowledge" (Burnett xx-xxi)

## Chapter Six:  Humans --- Machines  (117-42)

"De Rosnay does not simply collapse technology and the human body.  This is not his purpose.  Rather, and more important, he understands the connections that bind people and technology together.  The links that have been created -- the webs that join people, their environment, governments, cultures, economies, and, most important, technologies -- remain at the heart of a new understanding of what it means to be human" (Burnett 118)

"there is no doubt the convergence of biology and technology means that conventional definitions of human identity and subjectivity will undergo a profound alteration" (Burnett 118)

"The disparities between the brain and conscious observation, between a sense of self and biological operations cannot be reduced to something objective; rather, the many layers of difference among all the elements that make up though can only be judged through the various strategies used to understand subjectivity" (Burnett 120)

"The distributed nature of consciousness makes it difficult to reduce its complexity to a model, which is why it will be very difficult to create a machine with a mind" (Burnett 120)

"The reader may well ask what relevance a discussion of mind has to the study of digital forms of cultural production.  The central issue is how to distinguish between the living and nonliving" (Burnett 121)

"Human consciousness cannot be duplicated inside a machine, although this does not preclude the possible duplication of many aspects of the human body in machinic form" (Burnett 121)

"What happens when humans compare themselves to the operations of a machine?  Are they inevitably going to find themselves in the weaker position?  The answer to this question will not be found in any inherent lack of power.  The simplicity of the opposition between humans and machines can lead to paranoia and fear.  Yet it remains the case that machines are an integral part of definitions of human subjectivity.  If the impulse to compare humans to what has been created is dispensed with and an integrative approach is accepted, then it is likely that humans will be able to explore the implications of what they *share* with machines and computers" (Burnett 122)

"As I have mentioned, the problem is that research into the brain and consciousness, research straddling the boundaries among the neurosciences, cultural theory, and the mind, is in its infancy.  At the same time, many of the claims that are made about the mind seem to circle around metaphors that transform the mind into an apparatus.  This cultural impulse tries to turn thought processes into a series of mechanical activities.  It is the machine, so to speak, returning to haunt its creators from within.  Yet the choice to equate the mind with a computer, for example, results in a series of assumptions about the relationships between programming and knowledge that are not verifiable.  In what appears to be an endless circle, software is built to try to grasp processes that more often than not are within the realm of human consciousness.  The beauty, as well as the irony of this process, is that it creates and then sustains its own mythological and scientific infrastructure" (Burnett 124, internal citations omitted)

"In a general sense, computers are referred to through a series of anthropomorphic metaphors that both personalize and enlarge their role as 'agents' for exchange.  This is perhaps why the information that circulates through a computer is seen in more personal terms than other devices.  It is also why the attribution of intelligence moves along a consistent line even when machines fail in their duties" (Burnett 125)

"There is a reason humans transform machines into surrogates, and it is simply because they could not survive without them.  Machines act for people and with them; consequently, a measure of humanity is conferred upon them.  This is a natural outcome to the process of creating a world in which machines are partners with humans in every aspect of daily life" (Burnett 126)

"The fact that computers do many things seems to suggest that they have intelligence.  But a large measure of what is described as intelligence is derived from a self-reflexive understanding of thought processes" (Burnett 128)

"The desire to recreate the brain in a mechanical form is grounded in generalizations about human thinking.  These generalizations are founded on a hierarchy that places human thought above all other biological activities, including the body" (Burnett 129)

"I have been struck by the *weight* behind the process of digitization as opposed to the weightlessness of information.  So many complex systems have to be created and maintained for the digital environment to survive and flourish.  This weight has an impact on discussions of technological change and human identity in the twenty-first century.  In this context, does there need to be discussion about the creation of a *new* kind of human being?  Will avatars be the new storytellers?  Is this just the tip of the iceberg in the shift from nineteenth century notions of humans to twenty-first century experiments with cloning and bioengineering?  This is as much a question about the present as it is a question about the future" (Burnett 132)

"These phenomena, centered on artificial replication, are about the slippery borderlines between biology and machines and are an elaboration of the human desire to extend the boundaries of the mechanical world into the very tissues of what is meant by human nature" (Burnett 136)

"Ironically, so much of what happens in the human body is not in anyone's control.  Reproduction itself is an activity without a master.  There is no such thing as a perfect genetic blueprint... Human biology acts without a master and in so doing makes use of autonomous processes that are not reducible to a simple set of instructions, although it is one of the conceits of humans that they think control is possible" (Burnett 137)

"Metaphors of autonomy and control circulate regularly within the computer sciences.  A belief in these metaphors has paradoxically contributed to advances in computing technology.  It is an irony that the mythology of control makes it possible to envision rules and procedures that connect machines to mind.  The problem is that the effort to reverse engineer human-machine relations ends up modeling the mind in such a contradictory manner that machines seem to be more powerful than their inventors ever intended" (Burnett 139)

"It is an irony that machines, particularly computers, are allowing researchers to rewrite the underlying codes for the natural world" (Burnett 139)

"The overall goal of understanding the brain from biological and chemical perspectives is laudable.  But mechanical metaphors have an attraction that can lead to reductive notions of human consciousness and even more reductive ideas about how humans learn.  If the mind is simply an input-output mechanism, then the ways in which information moves from an environment to mind and then from mind to language and expression can be portrayed simply and directly.  If computers are, similarly, input-output devices, then the jump to mechanical strategies of learning and information acquisition seems like a natural move" (Burnett 140)
