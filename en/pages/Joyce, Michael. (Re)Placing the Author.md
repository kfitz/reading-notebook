"What's changed is not the thing but its placement.  Print stays itself, electronic text replaces itself.  Electronic text is as apt to evolve before it forms, as apt to dissolve before it finishes.  On the screen it takes our constant and attentive interaction to maintain even the simulacrum of static text." (Joyce 273)

"The constructive hypertext is a version of what it is becoming, a structure for what does not yet exist.  As such it is both the self-organizing phase of the reader who replaces the retreating writer, and the readable trace, time remembered in the unraveling retreat of this replacement.  The one who will write will have to recall what the one before has written in such a way that the next one, the third self -- you who writes after us -- may find the one finding the other first." (Joyce 277)

"I was trying to think about how to talk about the replacement of the author in its double sense: the author moves to another place, the author is put in another place." (Joyce 279)

"The electronic text is a dissipative (belief) structure, and the reader is apt to believe that its states and forms are exactly the same thing. The electronic text thus embodies a multiplicity of forces in the associational schema which it presents.  Contours are not forms in the text, the author or the reader, but rather those moments which express relationships among them in the form of the reader as writer." (Joyce 283)
