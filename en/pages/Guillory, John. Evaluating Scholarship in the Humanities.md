Guillory, John. "Evaluating Scholarship in the Humanities: Principles and Procedures." ADE Bulletin 137 (Spring 2005): 18-33.

"the practice of evaluating individual works of scholarship is also a practice through which the value of scholarship is expressed to ourselves, to those in nonhumanities disciplines, and ultimately to those who fund the university, whether by donation, tuition, or through the taxes they pay" (18)

"if scholarship can be distinguished as a practice from the fact of publication as product — as I argue it must be — then it is possible to demonstrate that scholarship as publication counts in the university’s system of rewards at the cost of distorting the practice of scholarship and of limiting its range of expression" (19)

"It will not suffice to despair of scholarship’s survival before one attempts to convey a better sense of what it is or why it has social value." (19)

"Evaluation is not just a simple gesture of thumbs up or down, a non disputandum est. The foreclosure of discourse implied by that inarticulate gesture serves no one particularly well, but, on the other hand, let us not underestimate the difficulty of devising a language and mode of discourse specific to the task of evaluation and to establishing the condition of accountability or answerability — the capacity of the evaluator to elaborate on her or his account of the work when requested to do so." (19)

"institutional conditions militate against what I call accountability and in favor of its eventual negation in the recourse to counting, the quantification of judgment" (19)

as the process of judgment in a tenure/promotion evaluation is gradually "externalized," moving from specialists to a department to a college to a university, "the cumulative record of publication and other numerable measures substitute for the information-rich accounts or descriptions of scholarly work by experts in the field" (20)

"At the most external site of evaluation, no reading of a candidate’s work need be done at all and would even in some ways be undesirable." (20)

"The quantifying of achievement is a policy currently arousing great concern in the humanities, for very good reason, if one can demonstrate in some (or any) cases a disparity between objective measures and contradictory but persuasively argued subjective judgments about the quality of a scholar’s work." (20)

"The confusion of peer review with absence of bias is an error — the point of peer review is to acknowledge the immanence of field expertise. Though we may hope for disinterested referees, disinterest is neither necessary nor inevitable in peer review." (21)

"deep disagreements might actually be indicators that a scholarly project is ahead of its time, that it will one day, if not today, prove its worth. Conversely, on occasion, unanimity about the value of a project may indicate that it is behind its time, that it is only telling us what we already know, or think we know." (21)

"The identification of scholarship with publication means that in the scene of evaluation the fact of publication is understood as objective evidence of achievement. Publication is a desirable fate for scholarly work, but publication itself, the fact of it, is not what we really mean (or should mean) by a 'contribution to scholarship.'" (22)

"Once work is published, it gains a limited immunity from subjective evaluation; it makes a stubborn claim to constitute accomplishment and therefore to merit reward, whether or not the work is ever read, whether or not it matters to anyone. Publication thus makes a claim to *be* scholarship, and not just a means to *make public* scholarly work." (23)

"Writing for the sake of publication is not the same as aiming to make scholarship public and often enough results in poor scholarship." (23)

"As a systemwide tendency, raising standards by demanding more publication is paradoxically likely to result in a decline in the quality of scholarship and a creeping cynicism about publication." (23)

"One might point out that whether one evaluates an unpublished manuscript or a published book, the object of evaluation remains the same, namely scholarship. And yet we cannot deny that the fact of publication has and will probably continue to make the most consequential difference in the process of evaluation." (23)

Electronic publication "draws attention to the underlying problem of how to translate acts of evaluation into objective measures. The book possesses the quality of objectivity in part because it is a material object. It objectifies accomplishment in a literal way. Electronic publication will have to compete with this tacit sense of objectivity, which in the end may be more difficult to replicate than the procedures of peer review." (24)

"If the demand for more publication is understood as the way to raise standards, this tacit equation of publication and scholarship drives evaluation as quickly as possible out of the sphere of immanence in favor of counting publications." (24)

We believe that we "cannot finally judge scholarly work itself, apart from the visible signs of accomplishment recorded in the cv, because we can no longer make our judgments about scholarship objective in some epistemological sense of incontestable." (24-25)

"If it is said, nonetheless, that confidential letters of reference are more reliable by virtue of their confidentiality, one might reply that the reverse is rapidly becoming the case. These letters may be written more and more for the eyes of tenure review committees — for the external scene of evaluation — and hence written with an anxious awareness that any criticism at all of a candidate’s work might be sufficient to precipitate denial of tenure." (26)

"humanities scholars have done a poor job of giving an account of what they do that would both excite interest in scholarship and inspire trust in the immanent judgment of specialists." (27)
