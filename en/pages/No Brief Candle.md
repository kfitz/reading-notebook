No Brief Candle: Reconceiving Research Libraries for the 21st Century. Washington, DC: Council on Library and Information Resources, 2008. <http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub142>

"What are the critical functions of the research library in this changing landscape? How should we be rethinking the research library in a dynamic, swiftly changing landscape dominated by digital technology?" (1)

"Researchers are asking new questions and are developing new methodological approaches and intellectual strategies. These methods may entail new models of scholarly communication—for example, a greater reliance on data sets and multimedia presentations. This, in turn, has profound consequences for academic publications: it is difficult to imagine traditional printed books and journals adequately capturing these novel approaches. With the predicted rise in new forms of scholarship, the promotion-and-tenure process, which favors print publications, especially in the humanities, will need to be rethought. As these methods of communication change, the procedures, skills, and expertise that libraries need to manage them will change as well." (2)

"Libraries are by nature conserving institutions, and this is what we entrust them to do. But how do we balance a conservative, risk-averse nature with the need to respond to a changing environment? We need to think more deeply about what we want our institutions to conserve." (2)

"Increasingly, humanist scholars are creating work with dynamic processes that will need a home. Could the library provide such a home, and might this be a way for librarians to connect with faculty? This would require rethinking how resources are allocated. It can be difficult to convince provosts to hire new staff simply because they are needed for experiments. It can be harder still to sustain momentum and retain innovative staff with short-term project funding." (6) -- see institutions chapter

"The connection between the university press and the university is fragile. Many publishers are carrying on in old modes; for example, they are focused on converting print to digital. But the potential utility of collections goes beyond just having them in digital form; it extends to the ability to layer intellectual value on top of raw text." (6)

"the library of the 21st century will be more of an abstraction than a traditional presence" (8)

"The library will play a critical role in ensuring the authentication and persistence of digital information, including Web-based information, that is important to future scholars." (9)

"I believe that the leadership of the great universities will have to create a collective institution whose job it will be to assure the 'bibliographic' integrity of digital scholarly materials." (Paul Courant, "The Future of the Library in the Research University" 27)
