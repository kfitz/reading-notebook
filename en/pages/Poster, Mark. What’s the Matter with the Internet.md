Poster, Mark.  What’s the Matter with the Internet?  Minneapolis:  University of Minnesota Press, 2001.

Chapter One:  The Culture of Underdetermination

Culture and New Media.

the problem with “culture”

yet the study of new media requires a solid concept of culture, if it is to escape cooptation by the state, which colonizes new media with “the culture of instrumentality” (Poster 2)

dominant institutions see internet as useful or dangerous tool; “As long as we remain within an instrumental framework we cannot question it, define its limits, or look to new media in relation to how it might generate new cultures.” (Poster 3)

scholarly world similarly imposes its culture on the study of new media, particularly with regard to the subject, looking to the internet “for signs of change among groups in positions of subordination” (Poster 3) — new media again become instrumental, tools of domination or subversion

another question that hasn’t been asked:  “How may the Internet mediate the transformation of existing cultural figures, or how may new cultural forms emerge that do not necessarily improve the position of existing groups as they are currently constituted but change them in unforeseeable ways?”  (Poster 3)

cultural studies also “refuses the cultural question of the Internet” (Poster 4) by configuring new media as a threat to “general types of practice that are characterized as ‘human’” (Poster 4); this approach makes it impossible to explore how the internet might be made “habitable” or used for political action

new media “fundamentally shifts the registers of human experience” (Poster 4) in terms of our experience of time and space, body and mind, subject and object, human and machine

and yet this shift is not historically unprecedented — early shifts in mediation like writing produced similar changes

“The study of the culture of the Internet, then, must seek in the analytics of man/machine, subject/object, body/mind, and time/space a new configuration of the construction of the subject.” (Poster 6)

Subject and Identity

defining terms:  individual and self as undefined, empirical givens

subject as modern configuration of the self, the profound center of the individual, to be separated from objects; such separation makes reason possible — subject is therefore a heroic bourgeois figure

identity comes into play once coherence of individual begins to collapse; identity as series of crises, producing only tentative stability; “The term identity is the recognition of the failure of Western culture, a failure inscribed in the massive disasters of the twentieth century.  It is an ideological compromise that saves and masks traditional individualism, and adjusts it to such changes in culture as the disappearance of the proletariat, the emergence of consumer culture, the diffusion of electronic media, and the demise of Europe from world hegemony.” (Poster 7)

“Individuals defined as their identity are hardly agents in the sense of the figure of the subject.” (Poster 7)

difference between subject and identity important in new media; individuals are constructed/interpellated as subjects/identities in linguistic practices; in the postmodern, those practices are increasingly machine-mediated

“illicit” universalism of term “postmodernism”:  “Since the category of the subject was discursively inscribed as universal, even though it betrayed its conditions of birth in white, Western male culture, the suggestion that it has collapsed incorporated the same universalist gesture.” (Poster 10)

to fully escape the universalizing tendency, we cannot merely appeal to categories of difference, but rather should include the machinic elements of interpellation:  “If we are to study the culture of new media we need to take into account the information machines that increasingly mediate our symbolic practices.” (Poster 10) — machines remove us from territorialized spaces and “enable practices that fit badly with earlier complexes of domination, putting them into question and thereby opening the field” (Poster 11)

Underdetermination

Byron Reeves and Clifford Nass, The Media Equation — how people treat televisions and computers like human beings — obvious complaint is that people and machines are different; but the argument does point out the need to study man-machine relations differently in the age of new media

need a historical problematic, but one that does not totalize; use Foucauldian genealogy:  “If we look at the Internet from a genealogical point of view we might avoid technophobic demonization and naïve celebration, and we might avoid overlooking what is genuinely different about it as well as greeting it as an impossible, absolute novelty.” (Poster 13)

what is new about the Internet is that it is underdetermined

print supported the construction of the autonomous, rational individual; radio, film, and television changed the construction of that individual, recasting the individual as diffuse, fragmentary, and multiple, and beginning to undermine the subject/object distinction (via the simulacrum — undermines relationship of information to some objectively existing outside world), though in part sustaining the modern sense of the individual

“With the Internet, by contrast, we find objects before us whose determination is to a very considerable extent underdetermined... the Internet transgresses the limits of the print and broadcast models by (1) enabling many-to-many communications; (2) enabling the simultaneous reception, alteration, and redistribution of cultural objects; (3) dislocating communicative action from the posts of the nation, from the territorialized spatial relations of modernity; (4) providing instantaneous global contact; and (5) inserting the modern/late modern subject into an information machine apparatus that is networked.  The result is a more completely postmodern subject...” (Poster 16)

overdetermination v. underdetermination:  overdetermination suggests multiplicity of causality, and thus fatedness, while paradoxically also suggesting contingency; “With the term underdetermination, I contend that certain social objects that I call virtual (hypertexts, for example) are overdetermined in such a way that their level of complexity or indeterminateness goes one step further.” (Poster 17) — instability of the virtual text

questions about the nature of subject/object relations under conditions of virtuality, when all subjects and objects are underdetermined

Chapter Two:  The Being of Technologies

Terms and Confusions

difficulty in translating and defining technology; originally referred to discourse about the arts, but now refers to machinery

using technology interchangeably with machinery is misleading in the age of smart machines, as it does not distinguish between types of machines (mechanical, electrical) or between machines that work on natural materials and machines that work on information

two western intellectual responses to technology:  “One view sees technology as beneficial to the humanist project of diminishing toil, eliminating disease, and pacifying the earth.” (Poster 22); the other group sees dangers in technology

“In general the first group are instrumentalists, understanding technology as a neutral tool that only becomes objectionable by the uses to which it is put.  The second group, termed substantialists by Andrew Feenberg (1991), discern significant effects to any implementation of technology, whatever their moral outcomes.” (Poster 22)

both understandings are inadequate in relation to the information machine:  “The instrumentalist position fails to recognize the transformative powers of information machines, whereas the substantialist position gears its critique of technology to processes that have little play when acting upon matter is not at issue.” (Poster 23)

“information machines upset the position from which the critique of mechanical machines was raised, the view of humans as agents or subjects distinct from and in a state of opposition to a world of objects.  Information machines put into question humanity as instrumental agent and thereby disqualify the critique of technology as ‘dehumanizing’.” (Poster 23)

“Information machines transform the humans that use them.” (Poster 23)

Baudrillard and the hyperreal:  “it appeared that television was the engine of the hyperreal.  Before the television monitor, the individual participates in a new cultural space in which the definition of truth is altered.  No longer a correspondence to reality, no longer posing the critical question (‘What relation does what I see bear to what I know?’), televisual epistemology asks rather, ‘Does what I see hold my attention or urge me to switch channels?’” (Poster 24)

humanist rejection of Baudrillard, and yet he did not wholly reject it; “His writings oozed with the spleen of the very humanist culture that found him outrageous.” (Poster 25) — categories of simulacra and the hyperreal maintain a relation of opposition to the real

same revulsion toward postmodern culture visible in Virilio

“For Virilio speed was the key to understanding the twentieth century” (Poster 25); “dromology” as the new science of speed, combining study of perception of movement with study of technologies of movement

“A continuing problem in the work of both [Baudrillard and Virilio] is a residual dread of the machinic that derives not from a proper cautionary sense about innovations but from humanist assumptions about the relations of machines to people.” (Poster 26)

new initiatives in studying the relations of humans and machines begun by Pierre Lévy and Félix Guattari

Lévy on the virtual:  “The virtual world of the Internet connects human intelligence from around the globe, installing in principle a new structure of interaction.” (Poster 27) — new relations between subjects and objects, combining and reshaping one another

“Whereas mechanical machines are inserted into hierarchically organized social systems, obeying and enhancing this type of structure, the Internet is ruled by no one and is open to expansion or addition at anyone’s whim as long as its communication protocols are followed.” (Poster 27) — D&G on arboreal v. rhizomatic

see esp. Guattari, Chaosmosis; critique of Heidegger’s “The Question Concerning Technology” — an ontology of machines

The Question Concerning Heidegger

critique of technology as horror story — must slowly bring danger into reader’s awareness

five theses:  “The first thesis is that culture is invisible to its members or, in relation to technology, that the instrumental attitude commonly attributed to technology obscures its cultural aspect.” (Poster 30)

second thesis:  “one can dispel this invisibility by studying ancient Greek philosophy.” (Poster 31); “Precisely because humans are not prefigured [in Greek philosophy] as agents counterposed to an object world that is other to them they paradoxically are able to perceive their agency within Being.” (Poster 31)

third thesis:  “the return to Greece is taken as a discovery of ‘the truth’.” (Poster 31)

fourth thesis:  “the philosopher’s transcendentalism still affords an understanding of technology as culture.” (Poster 32)

fifth thesis:  “this understanding is flawed by its inability to discern different technologies, different technocultures, different modes of revealing.” (Poster 32)

limits of this last position: captures the revealing of modern technology, but not postmodern:  “I contend that some information technologies, in their complex assemblages, partake not only of enframing but also of forms of revealing that do not conceal but solicit participants to a relation to Being as freedom.” (Poster 33)

understood in one way, computer technologies produce the same kind of enframing as other modern technologies; Poster instead argues that “there is a being of technology and that it varies depending upon the material constraints of the technology.” (Poster 35)

Machinic Epistemology

avoiding both Heidegger’s pitfalls as well as those of technological determinism requires an approach to technology through “the specificity of the machinic” (Poster 36)

Chapter Three:  Capitalism’s Linguistic Turn

is “language itself … falling under the domain of private property”? (Poster 39) — intellectual property and commodification of information as capitalism’s linguistic turn

in Euro-American philosophy, the linguistic turn redefined the real by shifting priority from consciousness to language; some suggest this as the marker of a turn from humanism to posthumanism

here, linguistic turn signifies “an equally profound change in the way commodities are produced, distributed, and consumed” (Poster 40)

increased efficiency in production required the creation of the consumer, via advertising

“it is not only the production process that is becoming digitized and the organization that is becoming knowledge-based, but the products themselves, both those used in production and those purchased by consumers, are becoming digital.” (Poster 43)

hegemony of market principles quickly extended to cover the internet; brought about massive boosterism and anxiety:  “Many felt that capitalist principles would destroy the Internet as they had known it, introducing censorship by the government and copyright law by the economy, transforming the free space of exchange and sharing into a nightmare of surveillance and greed.  Fears and hopes were exaggerated on all sides.” (Poster 45)

but the internet doesn’t follow traditional capitalist principles:  it’s decentralized, intelligent, and non-reliant on supply and demand

new technologies also shift relations between consumers and producers, as technologies allow for easy reproduction:  “In industrial technology, reproduction of commodities was the exclusive privilege and capability of the producer.  Producer and consumer stood apart and were differentiated precisely by this distinction.” (Poster 47)

“The Internet extends the figure of the producing consumer of earlier technologies and makes this the very principle, the automatic operation, of every communication.” (Poster 48)

“no longer do we need to ask how best to advance production, given the constraints of industrial capitalism.  We need to ask instead, Can capitalism still justify itself in an age when the consumer is already a producer?  Rather than asking how we can apply the law (of copyright) to the Internet, we need to ask, Is copyright the best law to apply to the Internet?” (Poster 48)

internet forces us to raise questions of the political nature of culture

“The role of the media in culture, in their capitalist form, is sharply in question.  But this is a question that the culture industry wishes not to pose.  Their question is how to make money distributing cultural objects on the Net, when it should be what role, if any, they ought to play in the new regime of cyberspace.” (Poster 54)

“As political economy faces enormous difficulties coping with digital commodities, so does the critique of political economy.” (Poster 54)

many think of the internet as a public good (like common lands) or a gift economy; neither model captures either the social construction of the objects shared or the anonymous nature of their sharing; Poster argues instead for an economy of sharing

yet of course the net introduced a hypercapitalism — the bubble that has now burst

Chapter Four:  The Digital Subject and Cultural Theory

need to “invent the Humanities in relation to digital texts” (Poster 60) — but this is not necessarily a good thing; see David Noble & digital diploma mills

need to acknowledge benefits, not just “capitalist incursions” into the scholarly enterprise

failures of digital intellectual property law:  “With the digitization of print, film, radio, and television broadcasts and their insertion into a global network, the media in which intellectual property appears alters the message of its legal integument.  Put otherwise, the commodity form of cultural objects and the authorial coherence of individual subjects are shaken by digitization.” (Poster 62)

state of authorship in the digital age:  “In the guise of protecting authors, media moguls — those who have most exploited authors — raise the banner of copyright protection against what they see as the anarchic exchange of bytes on the Internet….Such self-righteous posturing poorly conceals the helplessness of the media industry in the face of the sharing of the cultural objects on the Net.” (Poster 62-63)

“This chapter brings together an analysis of the technical conditions of authorship in print and in cyberspace with the theoretical proposals for understanding the question of the construction of the author.” (Poster 63) — most other attempts at analysis can do one or the other, but not both

Benjamin & mechanical reproduction:  importance of his work was his lack of technophobia and suspicion of popular culture, but especially his “sense of the mobility and constructedness of basic cultural forms such as author and audience, detaching these from a foundationalist view that ensconced them within the figure of the Cartesian subject.” (Poster 64)

“The legally defined rights of the author required a print technology that could reproduce large quantities of texts, a market system that could determine printed products as objects for sale, and distribution institutions that could make identical copies available in many places, a discursive regime in which individuals were understood as agents capable of inventing new things and as proprietors with interests in accumulating capital....Authorship also required, as I shall argue below, a technology of the analogue:  a conviction that what was printed in the book was a direct representation of an author’s intention, be it in the form of idea, style, or rhetoric; in short, that the book was an analogue reproduction of an original, authentic author.” (Poster 65)

Foucault on authorship:  four perspectives — the humanist author; the structuralist rejection of the humanist author (Barthes); the poststructuralist rejection of the structuralist annihilation of the author, with a consideration of the “author function” as discursive figure; a future, utopian nonauthor

P. connects this nonauthor to the position of authors in cyberspace:  “Digital writing in many of its forms separates the author from the text, as does print, but also mobilizes the text so that the reader transforms it, not simply in his or her mind or in his or her marginalia, but in the text itself so that it may be redistributed as another text.” (Poster 68)

analogue author = author function; digital author = post-author utopia (analogue and digital here suggesting the centrality of machinic mediation)

difference between the two is “the degree and shape of alterity in the relation of author to writing” (Poster 69); analogue author bears bond between self and text; digital author less so

“digital writing is both a technological inscription of the author and a term to designate a new historical constellation of authorship, one that is emergent, but seemingly more and more predominant.” (Poster 69)

Poster claims to “reconfigure” the terms analogue and digital to “designate degrees of otherness in the relation of authors to texts” (Poster 70).  But what about the degrees of otherness among authors?  Are certain authors privileged to become digital, while others are forced by economic and cultural circumstances to remain analogue?  Conversely, as a culture, do we ascribe some cachet to those authors able to break into the analogue world, while assuming invisibility for those digital?  Why is it that just as marginalized groups have access to a technology that will give them a voice, that voice is suddenly dislocated from its origins?

change from analogue to digital author systems “disrupts the existing arrays of powers that supported and benefited from it”, including hierarchies of gender (Poster 70)

“It may come as a surprise, then, to find some of these social and cultural critics not at all pleased with the utopia envisioned by Foucault; instead they see in it a threat to their perceived opportunities for justice.” (Poster 70) — exactly

“Some critics countered this defense of the subject by arguing that subordinated subject positions ought not to strive to occupy the place and take on the subject position of the ruling group.” (Poster 71) — see Irigaray

Butler:  “goes on to argue that speech acts in modern society produced the sovereign agent as a false denial of the way language structures agency in the first place” (Poster 72) — thus the poststructuralist critique does away not with agency but with sovereignty

“The issue at stake in digitization of authorship may now be sharply posed:  how is the subject reconfigured in this process?” (Poster 73) — Butler’s performative, which constitute the subject, but only ambiguously and incompletely

how do different body-text relations, in different media, configure the performative process differently?

digital authors in synchronous modes are engaged in “the performance of self-constitution” (Poster 75)

“So exigent is the practice of self-constitution in communications in cyberspace, so strongly is agency here mediated by information machines, and so utterly dispersed is the space of interaction that oppositional practices of earlier decades no longer seem able to take hold of the situation.  To insist upon agency politics in this context is to bury one’s face in the sand of the bygone age of Man.” (Poster 76)

Chapter Five:  Authors Analogue and Digital

need to study the “alteration in the material structure of the trace” in the shift from analogue to digital writing (Poster 78)

analogue refers to the relationship of analogy between a copy and an original; no such relation or resemblance exists in digital copies; both include a material transformation of the original, but one maintains resemblance and one does not

“There are two separate but related questions that follow from the analogue/digital distinction.  The first concerns the qualities of difference between the analogue and the digital.  The second concerns the specific attributes of the digital as a material form, its electronic character, its numeric character, its ability to be reproduced exactly, transmitted at the speed of light, and stored very efficiently.” (Poster 80)

“the distinction between speech and writing is much greater than the variations in the written form.  That much must be conceded.  Is then digital writing to be understood as yet another variation within the history of writing, or is it a more momentous change on the order of the shift from speech to writing?” (Poster 80)

relationships of alphabets to objects is not analogue, but relationships of alphabets to sounds is more nearly isomorphic

easy reproduction of printed forms of writing change culture by retaining writing’s temporal reach but extending spatial distribution, thereby democratizing writing; but print retains material constraints of other forms of writing: scarcity of durable materials

“Digitization does not surrender the advantages of writing and print in extending language in time and space or of the alphabet in deepening the articulation of language.  Digitization introduces yet another level of articulation of language, however, by introducing sequences of ones and zeroes as representations of letters.” (Poster 82) — binary code enables writing to transcend the limits of materiality and become electric

but what aspect of the technology should most be focused upon: “the computer as machine, the software program, the graphical interface, the network, the programming code, or the binary storage system, to mention a few possibilities?” (Poster 82)

Friedrich Kittler: “contrasts technocultures on the basis of their ability to store, transmit, and compute the real.” (Poster 83)

“Individuals disciplined by, interpellated by, and accustomed to novels in the form of books often find it very difficult to grasp the innovation of virtual reality systems.  Such bookish types regard the novel as already a virtual reality system.  But this is only so, after Kittler, because these readers of books ‘hallucinate’ the audio and video data missing from the printed word on the page.” (Poster 83) — is this, in the inverse, perhaps the explanation that should be given to all those professors who lament that today’s students can’t really read anymore — having been disciplined and interpellated by media that have audio and video tracks, they are less capable of “hallucinating”  the additional information required to read a book?

Poster agrees:  “Book readers may find no use for virtual reality systems, film, and the rest, even complaining that the book is superior to these media when in fact they merely register their preference for one technology over others.  They often fail to see how individuals constituted by other media — film, television, or virtual reality — might prefer these over books because, constituted in a different technoculture, they have developed different capacities of reception, perhaps visual imaginaries, producing cultural meaning out of visual and aural information or data flows.  With the mind-boggling multiplication of media technologies in the twentieth century (not to mention what we are likely to witness in the twenty-first), it becomes imperative, in institutions of higher learning especially, to understand the multiple capacities of subjects constituted by various media, instead of blindly and repeatedly insisting that only one media — the book — and only one set of cultural skills — the imagination or rationality — deserves recognition as intelligence.” (Poster 84)

Vilém Flusser:  subject constituted through reading books is linear; “Contrary to Kittler’s understanding of the book as constituting a subject with interiority and an extended imaginary function, Flusser configures the analogue author as having a linear mentality, as one who amplifies certain forms of rationality.” (Poster 85)

Poster explores the figure of the author via copyright

early books were product of the socio-cultural structure of the guild, and thus were the product of collective labor, not individual:  “Our print culture contains two principles, neither of which applied in the first century or so of book production:  that the copy one sees in one’s hands is an exact duplicate of all others, especially those of the same edition, and that the ‘author’ of the book may be trusted to have written the words one reads.” (Poster 87)

authors not figures of trust in early printing:  “When today we question the truth value of words or images on the Internet, we are simply in the same position as readers of books were in the seventeenth century.” (Poster 89) — true.  But this makes it sound as though the problem was merely one of epistemology; in fact, the author figure became an object of trust not simply because we changed our thinking, but because social structures were put in place to ensure his trustworthiness (editors, publishers, etc.)

for the author to pre-empt the guild-master, “individuals had to be defined as interior consciousness, which could then be externalized first in manuscripts, then in print.  The value of originality in consciousness had to grow, and readers had to develop skills to interpret it and render it significant.” (Poster 89)

by the end of the 19th c., though, authors begin losing prominence to “the captains of the culture industry”; “The irony of this history is that academic disciplines in the humanities became institutionalized just as analogue authors began to lose control of cultural commodities. It has been the burden and the glory of the humanities to preserve the analogue author just as this figure became socially irrelevant.” (Poster 89-90)

in broadcast media, “with larger sums of money at stake, those in control of the means of production took a greater degree of control over the production or creation of the cultural object.” (Poster 90)

“With the broadcasting model of cultural reproduction, brand names, logos, images, and trademarks displace the author from the center of the cultural object and the focus of copyright” (Poster 90)

“the shift in the scene of writing from paper and pen or typewriter to the globally networked computer is a move that elicits a rearticulation of the author from the center of the text to its margins, from the source of meaning to an offering, a point in a sequence of a continuously transformed matrix of signification.” (Poster 91)

attempting to avoid technological determinism, but nonetheless suggesting that the next thing that happens to authorship “is or may be” a move from “the author function of modernity to a multiple, unstable author of postmodernity” (Poster 91)

“Digital texts are subject to a material regime fundamentally different from analogue texts.  I contend that the author function of the analogue period of textual reproduction cannot endure the change to the technology of the power of bits.” (Poster 93)

digital authorship will require alterations in the author figure, in the readerly imagination, in definitions of authors’ rights, in editing publishing, and distribution practices, and so forth

hypertext as “the paradigm of the digital author” (Poster 94)

Espen Aarseth on “ergodic” texts — claims that they “depend for their qualities not on the material structure of the text but on its relation to the reader” (Poster 96) — claims that what is important is the reader’s ability to change the text;  “But does not the material form of the text dictate whether the user can change it or not?” (Poster 96)

must not allow our thinking about digital authorship to be confined to hypertext; must take on the totality of synchronous and asynchronous modes of communication on the net; “Digital authors are not simply separated from their words, as they are in the print media, but reconfigured by their relation to the machinic apparatus.” (Poster 97)

analogue author’s correspondence to the modern subject:  “fit well with the emerging sense of the body as private, the self as separate from the world of objects, and the investment in rationality as human essence and consciousness as the source of meaning.” (Poster 97); also fit well with “the narcissistic arrogance of European superiority and imperialist adventure and with patriarchy in its new articulation in the urban nuclear family.” (Poster 98); digital writing appears at very different historical moment

brief consideration of digital visuality and its alteration of the modern rules of perspective

Chapter Six:  Nations, Identities, and Global Technologies

crumbling of the nation-state in the face of global networks — a positive, liberatory moment, or one to be alarmed by?

“In this chapter I shall briefly examine these trends, look at the various anxieties provoked by globalizing information flows, and attempt to outline a way of conceptualizing the current situation with an emphasis on its emancipatory possibilities.” (Poster 101)

three kinds of transnational phenomena:  commodities, populations, and information

internet combines the decentralized communications network of  telephony with the large audiences of the broadcast model of television; but improves on each:  not circuit-switched, like telephones, and many-to-many, unlike television

digitization undermines nation-state by creating a culture that cannot be controlled by national laws

postnational anxiety

fears produced by new technologies (Poster 106-107):  “In each case an important component of the anxiety is a sense of threatened authority” (Poster 107)

not endorsing or dismissing fears of internet, but rather suggesting that “there is a historic process under way that does involve changes and losses but that also affords new opportunities and new political articulations” (Poster 107)

“there is found today a tendency to regret a supposed loss of community, of the copresence of bodies in space, and to blame the computer for it when in fact this alleged loss of community is a process that began much earlier in the history of modernity and was once associated with the liberation of the mind from the force of hierarchical relations, from the stifling closeness of copresent bodies.” (Poster 108-109)

“The bond between human and machine, I now think, underwent a profound modification with the introduction of the computer.  A symbiotic practice emerged in which the human and the machine constitute a new assemblage in social space.” (Poster 109); multiply the anxieties created by this assemblage by millions when the machine is connected to a global network of millions of other machines and people

parental anxieties about Internet influence on children; governmental anxieties about cryptography; intellectual anxieties about text’s invisibility and the merging of subject with machine; world anxieties about U.S. cultural imperialism

historical form of nation as relatively recent; process included “the destruction of regional and local powers by monarchies and the formation of legislative institutions as a compromise between powerful, contending groups” and “the formation of bureaucratic apparatuses attached to the monarchies” (Poster 118)

also changes in the individual:  shift from kinship identification to nation — complex and chaotic process; question turns on figure of citizen; the nation presupposed the free individual, the Cartesian subject

had to redefine subject of monarchy to become “citizen subject,” while still excluding women, children, slaves, and nonwhites

nation now being superseded by globalizing processes, including multinational and transnational corporations, global treaty organizations, NGOs, etc.; cities as new centers of power, and citizen surpassed by person

print’s associations with interpellation of individuals into national citizens:  “There has never been a direct, face-to-face relation between national leadership and the voters but only one produced in practices of readership in the material channel of print.” (Poster 121)

Habermas & the public sphere: reading and writing subordinate to community speech; “the misleading portrait emerges of the public sphere as a logocentric community, rather than one dependent upon the space/time deferrals of print” (Poster 121); print’s mediation comes to be seen as inauthentic

by contrast, Benedict Anderson “underscores the mediating function of print by his insistence on the nation as an imagined construction” (Poster 122) — Poster replaces “imagined” with “mediated,” to refuse an opposition to the “real”

Michael Warner, The Letters of the Republic, “argues for a reciprocal play of influences between the medium of print and the public sphere” (Poster 123)

print technology folded into existing racial and gender hierarchies, thus favoring the participation of some groups and not others

“The crucial feature of the new media [of print] was the impersonality of voice that it constituted” (Poster 123).

“The public sphere of modern democracy substituted for the embodied presence of the collective the mediated community of ink and paper.” (Poster 124)

“Persons participating in these first electronic media [radio, film, and television] are interpellated not as universal, rational citizens, but, as Andy Warhol so presciently showed, as celebrities, those who are also absent subjects yet mediated by sound and image, not text.” (Poster 124)

print dislocated the citizen-reader from f2f community, but bound reader to material text object; “The Internet also enables disembodied community, but it places individuals in relations of interdependence with information machines; it introduces into the landscape of human society a profound bond with machines; it draws attention to the mediation of this bond in a way that deconstructs the modern subject position, undermines the relation of representation to the real, introduces a machinescape of underdetermined objects, and of cultural artifacts with such a degree of plasticity that issues of authorship, canons, authority itself are put into suspension and reconfigured.” (Poster 126)

“How then will the Internet construct subjects and how will these subjects become political agents?” (Poster 126) — that’s the question

“The Internet is no more universal than print was in eighteenth-century America.  Perhaps it is less so.” (Poster 127)

“If the Internet represents a new form of universalism, one must understand this not as a closure of human history, a final realization or telos or dialectic moving from parochialism to cosmopolitanism.  Instead Internet globalization suggests an articulation of the universal and particular at a level at once more general and more local than the nation-state.” (Poster 127)

Chapter Seven:  Theorizing the Virtual:  Baudrillard and Derrida

virtual reality “provides prostheses for the real in order to better control it,” but simultaneously calls that real into question, thus both supporting and undermining the project of modernity (Poster 129)

Baudrillardian simulation and its connections to virtual reality; often used simulation and virtual interchangeably, putting both in opposition to “reality”

more recently, “Baudrillard has become virtual and knows himself to be such; he argues that his critical theory of simulation has become nothing less than the principle of reality.” (Poster 134)

C.J. Keep draws distinction between a surface-oriented, passive, specular hyperreal and an immersive, interactive/active virtual reality

Baudrillard’s response to VR, rather than locating the specificity of the experience of the new technologies, instead “is to invent a new kind of discourse, dubbed ‘radical thought,’ in order to preserve his place in front and ahead of VR, in short, to repeat the gesture of the avant-garde.” (Poster 137)

Derrida:  the virtual as essential to the real, imbricated in the real — “hauntology”

???

“The question of politics in the age of virtual reality must depart from a new materialism, a new theory of the imbrication of technology and culture, one that comes to terms with the transformation of mechanical machines into smart machines, and digitizers of images, sounds, and text; it must commence from an appreciation of the dissemination of these software-hardware systems throughout social space and the installation of interfaces that unite humans and machines in new configurations of agency.” (Poster 146)

Chapter Eight:  Virtual Ethnicity

contested nature of terms ethnicity and race; “With a purpose of supporting oppressed groups in their struggles against domination, many critical thinkers wary of essentializing ethnicity as a stable, presocial center of identity nonetheless discover there a resort for resistance to domination.” (Poster 148)

Poster seems to be arguing that claims for meaning or resistance to be found in self-identification with a racial or ethnic group are at minimum undermined and at worse made pointless by the processes of globalization epitomized by the internet...?

“Is virtual ethnicity an alternative to the binaries of particularism and universalism, parochialism and cosmopolitanism, inserting itself between nations and communities, earthly ethnicities and races?  Is virtual ethnicity a transgression of essentialism in all its forms, including that of Western rationalism?  Does virtual ethnicity betoken a new age, a ‘postmodernity’ that spawns multiple, dispersed, heterogeneous subjects as well as global communities?” (Poster 150)

how does the internet’s many-to-many dialogic practice affect the constitution of ethnic identities?

in an attempt to avoid technological determinism while still acknowledging the particularities of the medium, Poster enumerates “four levels of technological inscription:  1.  The constraints of the medium, its material limits / 2.  The pretechnological conditions for the introduction of the medium; perceived needs that inspire innovation / 3.  The general cultural determinations of the medium, for example, the difference between the introduction of print in Europe and in China / 4.  The determinations of the medium through practices, that is, how people symbolize their experience with the medium” (Poster 154) — however, Poster, in having already discarded race and ethnicity as a valid category of cultural investigation in the digital age, fails to consider how they might affect his third level of inscription, how the differential rates of introduction to new technologies in various socio-economic communities within Europe and China — or the United States — might affect the medium’s determinations

“Zizek’s discursive move in this passage illustrates the classic gesture of ideology:  when faced with an apparent novelty, a seeming ‘revolution,’ to use his term, place it under the cover of one’s already existing position.  Two feats are thereby accomplished:  the threat of the new is dissolved and one’s position is expanded and strengthened.” (Poster 156) — isn’t this exactly what “postmodernist” theory did to postcolonial theory, and what Poster here does to theorists of race and ethnicity in cyberspace?

Poster seems to be intentionally missing the point in this chapter.  The point of considerations of “race” and “ethnicity” in the digital age is not to essentialize these terms but to point to the ways that these culturally constructed categories interact with and in cyberspace, how cyberspace furthers or alters their cultural construction and cultural reception, etc.

the different forms of mediation — f2f, print, broadcast, virtual — affect the individual’s experience and apprehension of ethnicity:  “While it certainly appears to be the case that premodern ethnicities, in their predominately verbal pattern of symbolic formation, were relatively stable, providing the individual with a fixed ethnic identification, this ethnicity still had to be produced and reproduced in discourses and practices, and it remained subject to change, to doubt, and to alteration.  It had to be inscribed.” (Poster 160)

in defining the virtual, “Two tendencies above all must be avoided:  to celebrate the virtual as an evolutionary or dialectical ‘next stage’ beyond the real or to dismiss the virtual as a false instantiation of the real.  Instead, the virtual must be understood as a historical articulation of the real, fully as actual as any other such articulation but one connected specifically with computer-mediated communication technologies.” (Poster 164)

“Since the bodily markers of ethnicity (physical attributes and vocal accent) are invisible on MOOs, such ethnicity as exists in those electronic communities is fully virtual, although the predominance of white American users often leads to the presumption that one is interacting with a white American person.” (Poster 165-66) — is gender, by virtue of being a “required” element of a MOO character, somehow less virtual?  This is just bizarre…

“these micropractices of everyday life made me Jewish, and these are, I believe, the factories of ethnicity” (Poster 167) — but isn’t “race” different?  Isn’t “race” determined less by the practices of one’s own daily life and more by the way one is practiced upon?  Can race then really be lumped into this analysis?

CyberJew participants argue that “the Internet, far from dissolving ethnicity, enables all Jews, wherever they are on the planet, to connect with one another.  The Internet here is a neutral instrument of community, connecting preestablished ethnic identities.” (Poster 167)

notion of Internet as “collective intelligence” “situates the individual in a virtual object, an unfinished, contingent state where identity is a temporary, fluid link to a process of creation, an underdetermined entity whose recognition is never a mis(s) because it never congeals into permanence, a subject position that is ‘never before’ rather than ‘always already’.” (Poster 169-70)

Chapter Nine:  CyberDemocracy:  Internet as a Public Sphere?

issues of political impact of internet:  “access, technological determinism, encryption, commodification, intellectual property, the public sphere, decentralization, anarchy, gender, and ethnicity” (Poster 171); however, “If questions are framed in relation to prevailing political structures, forces, and ideologies, for example, blinders are being imposed that exclude the question of the subject or identity construction from the domain of discussion.” (Poster 171)

in the govt’s focus on encryption, “The question of potentials for new forms of social space that might empower individuals in new ways is foreclosed in favor of preserving existing relations of force as they are viewed by the most powerful institution in the history of the world, the government of the United States.” (Poster 172)

“what are far more cogent [than questions of commodification] as possible long-term effects of the Internet are the way in which it institutes new social functions, ones that do not fit easily within those of characteristically modern organizations.” (Poster 172)

“If one places in brackets political theories that address modern governmental institutions  in order to open the path to an assessment of the ‘postmodern’ possibilities suggested by the Internet, two difficulties immediately emerge:  (1) there is no adequate ‘postmodern’ theory of politics, and (2) the issue of democracy, the dominant political norm and ideal, is itself a ‘modern’ category associated with the project of the Enlightenment.” (Poster 173)

Internet as radically decentralized:  “As a historian, I find it fascinating that this unique structure should emerge from a confluence of cultural communities that appear to have so little in common:  the Cold War Defense Department, which sought to ensure survival against nuclear attack by promoting decentralization, the countercultural ethos of computer programming engineers, who had a deep distaste for any form of censorship or active restraint of communications; and the world of university research, which habitually exchanges and shares ideas and data.” (Poster 175-76)

“what the Internet technology imposes is a dematerialization of communication and in many of its aspects a transformation of the subject position of the individual who engages within it.” (Poster 176); “Put differently, the Internet is more like a social space than a thing, so that its effects are more like those of Germany than those of hammers” (Poster 176)

“The question that needs to be asked about the relation of the Internet to democracy is this:  are there new kinds of relations occurring with it which suggest new forms of power configurations between communicating individuals?  In other words, is there a new politics on the Internet?” (Poster 177)

“If there is a public sphere on the Internet, who populates it and how?  In particular, one must ask, What kinds of beings exchange information in this public sphere?” (Poster 177)

raises many questions for further investigation — “What are the conditions of democratic speech in the mode of information?  What kind of ‘subject’ speaks or writes or communicates in these conditions?  What is its relation to machines?  What complexes of subjects, bodies, and machines are required for democratic exchange and emancipatory action?” (Poster 181) — but with few answers

“If the technological basis of the media has habitually been viewed as a threat to democracy, how can theory account for the turn toward a construction of technology (the Internet) that appears to promote a decentralization of discourse, if not of democracy itself, and appears to threaten the state (unmonitorable conversations), mock at private property (the infinite reproducibility of information), and flout moral propriety (the dissemination of images of unclothed people often in awkward positions)?” (Poster 182-83)

gender and virtual communities:  gender seen as “a general attribute of Internet identities” (Poster 184) in a way that race/ethnicity is not, because it is “required”; “The gendered body is replaced by the gendered text” (Poster 184); “The fact that sexual identities are self-designated does not in itself eliminate the annoyances and the constraints of patriarchy.” (Poster 184-85)
