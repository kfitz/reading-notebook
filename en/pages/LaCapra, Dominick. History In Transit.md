"Identity is probably best understood as a problematic constellation or more or less changing configuration of subject positions." (LaCapra 5)

"Identity should be neither idealized as always beneficent nor demonized and seen as a (if not the) source of the political ills of the modern world. Nor should it be conflated with identification in the sense of total fusion with others wherein difference is obliterated and criticism is tantamount to betrayal." (LaCapra 37)

"a defensible form of identity politics in which the concept of identity remained problematic, and the identification between self and other was countered by the recognition of alterity related both to internal self-questioning and to empathy or compassion attentive to difference and to the requirements of respect for the other as other" (LaCapra 42)

"I think it is crucial to take into account the process of undergoing or 'going through' in any acceptable definition of experience, and that process would involve an affective, not only a narrowly cognitive, response, with affectivity having a significant relation to an attempt (however cautious, constitutively limited, nonleveling, imperfect, and at times failed) at understanding the other (who may sometimes be, in the most significant respects, opaque or standoffish)." (LaCapra 43-44)

"In traumatic memory the past is not simply history as over and done with. It lives on experientially and haunts or possesses the self or the community (in the case of shared traumatic events) and must be worked through in order for it to be remembered with some degree of conscious control and critical perspective that enables survival and, in the best of circumstances, ethical and political agency in the present." (LaCapra 56)

"Empathy is too often conflated with identification, especially with the victim, and this conflation leads to an idealization or even sacralization of the victim as well as an often histrionic self-image as surrogate victim undergoing vicarious experience." (LaCapra 65)

"Empathy is, I think, a virtual but not a vicarious experience in that the historian puts him- or herself in the other's position without taking the other's place or becoming a substitute or surrogate for the other who is authorized to speak in the other's voice. Empathy involves affective response to the other, and affective response interacts with difference as well as critical distancing and analysis in historiography. It implies what I am terming empathic unsettlement in the secondary witness, including the historian in one of his or her roles or subject positions." (LaCapra 65)

"Objectification is a process through which the other is positioned as an object of description, analysis, commentary, critique, and experiment. It distances one from the experience of the other, notably in terms of empathic or compassionate understanding, and it restricts one's own experience in the production of knowledge to the process of objectification itself, hence to aloofness and at times ironic or critical detachment." (LaCapra 70)

"by 'transference' I mean primarily one's implication in the other or the object of study with the tendency to repeat in one's own discourse or practice tendencies active in, or projected into, the other or object." (LaCapra 74)

"Empathic or compassionate response may be seen as distinguishable from incorporative or projective identification and as involving a heteropathic mode of identification in which the difference between self and other is recognized. However it is figured, empathy, in the sense I am using the term, takes one out of oneself toward the other without eliminating or assimilating the difference or alterity of the other. It is in this sense 'ecstatic' rather than being a projection of what one has experienced onto the other. Neither should empathy be conflated with an incorporation of the other into one's own (narcissistic) self or understood instrumentally as a means of discovering one's own 'authentic' identity. On the contrary, it induces one to recognize one's internal alterity or difference from oneself -- one's own opacities and gaps that prevent full identity or self-knowledge and prompt a readiness to temper, qualify, or even in certain cases suspend judgment of the other. Empathy in this sense is enabled by internal alterity (or the unconscious) and based on one's being open to the other, who is constitutive of the formation of oneself. It is not a facile passe-partout but an affect crucial for a possible ethical relation to the other and hence for one's responsibility or answerability." (LaCapra 76-77)

"In those traumatized by their experience of extreme events and even in those empathically responding to them, at times to the point of identification, working-through may never transcend acting-out or reliving the past, and any unilinear schema of achieving 'health' or a 'cure' would be deceptive. Working-through may nonetheless render possible forms of activity that relate witnessing or giving testimony to broader sociopolitical processes that are oriented to achieving desirable change" (LaCapra 82)

"Recognizing transferential tendencies should ideally enable one to resist uncritical identification with the other and the derivation of one's identity from others in ways that deny their otherness. Such identification occurs when one becomes a mimetic disciple projectively reprocessing phenomena or texts in terms of a methodology or reading technology. Recognizing the force of, and trying to come to terms with, transference also enables one to appreciate both the insistence of tendencies toward identification and the limitations of objectification that ignores such tendencies, forecloses the problem of the investigator's subject positions, and denies the other's voice and the questions it poses for oneself and one's approach." (LaCapra 83)

"In terms of textual analysis, working-through implies the need explicitly to pose and explore the question of one's own transferential implication an the tendency to repeat or act out processes active in, or projected into, one's object of study." (LaCapra 103)

"In the virtual (in contrast to the vicarious) experience of trauma, one may imaginatively put oneself in the victim's position while respecting the difference between self and other and recognizing that one cannot take the victim's place or speak in the victim's voice. Such virtual experience may be connected with what I have termed empathic unsettlement, which, I would argue, is desirable or even necessary for a certain form of understanding that is constitutively limited but significant." (LaCapra 125)

"In the form I am proposing, empathy is not self-sufficient and does not mean unmediated identification, although the latter does tend to occur. Empathy is bound up with a transferential relation to the past, and it is arguably an affective aspect of understanding that both limits objectification and exposes the self to involvement or implication in the past, its actors, and victims. An empathic response requires the recognition of others as other than mere objects of research unable to question one or place one in question. And it does not substitute for, but on the contrary must be articulated with, normative judgment and sociopolitical response." (LaCapra 135)

"one need not simply dissociate affect or empathy from intellectual, cognitive, and stylistic or rhetorical concerns, and one may ask whether empathy is on some level necessary for even limited understanding. One may even contend that there can be no durable ethical and political change without the reeducation of affect in its relation to normative judgment" (LaCapra 137)
