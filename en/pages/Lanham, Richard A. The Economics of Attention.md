Lanham, Richard A. The Economics of Attention: Style and Substance in the Age of Information. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006.


"What's new about the digital expressive space and what's not?... What's new about the 'new economy' and what's not? Seeing clearly what is happening to the word as it moves from page to screen seems, to me at least, to depend on seeing clearly what is happening in the world that expressive field has to express.  Both are battles for attention as the scarce resource." (Lanham xi)

"information is not in short supply in the new information economy.  We're drowning in it.  What we lack is the human attention needed to make sense of it all.  It will be easier to find our place in the new regime if we think of it as an economics of attention.  Attention is the commodity in short supply." (Lanham xi)

"The devices that regulate attention are stylistic devices.  Attracting attention is what style is all about." (Lanham xi)

"In an economy of stuff, the laws of property govern who owns stuff.  In an attention economy, it is the laws of intellectual property that govern who gets attention." (Lanham xii)


Chapter One: Stuff and Fluff

"The age of information has brought with it a strange paradox.  Just when we are drowning in stuff, we seem to be abolishing it." (Lanham 1)

"When the world's most precious resource is immaterial, the economic doctrines, social structures, and political systems that evolved in a world devoted to the service of matter become rapidly ill suited to cope with the new situation." (Lanham 4)

"What, we might also ask, constitutes 'productivity' in an attention economy? We are trying out one obvious answer to this question by doing more than one thing at once." (Lanham 9)

"The World Wide Web has created what we might call 'the comedy of the commons.' It has developed into an ever-richer community resource.  The more people graze on it for their own purposes, the bigger it becomes and the greener its grass grows." (Lanham 13)

"Universities exist to 'uncover, capture, produce, and preserve' information.  Thus their increasing importance in advanced economies since World War II.  But universities have never been simply data-mining and storage operations.  They have always taken as their central activity the conversion of data into useful knowledge and into wisdom." (Lanham 13-14)

"Since World War II these debates about the 'relevance' and 'use' of education have grown increasingly acrimonious.  Let me suggest a new way to think about them.  They have been, at heart, about the relative importance of an economics of stuff and an economics of attention and, above all, about how to relate them, how to move from one to the other." (Lanham 14)

"clean information is not the destiny of humankind.  Clean information is unnatural and unuseful.  Information always comes charged with emotion of some kind, full of purpose.  That is why we have acquired it.  The only way to make it useful is to filter it.  And here is where style comes in.  We keep striving for 'pure information,' but the more information we have, the more we need filters, and one of the most powerful filters we have is the filtration of style." (Lanham 19)


Chapter Two: Economists of Attention

artists: Duchamp, Warhol, Christo


Chapter Three: What's Next for Text?

about the malleability of text in digital space; online version of chapter at http://www.rhetoricainc.com/eofa 

"The present fear in the bookish classes that formal reasoning is a thing of the past comes not from its imagined eclipse but from our halting efforts to democratize it." (Lanham 115)

"We need to find new shapes for traditional arguments and shapes for new kinds of arguments." (Lanham 115)


Chapter Four: An Alphabet that Thinks

on reading on a PDA:  "here, too, the advance -- if advance it was -- in expressive technology aimed to preserve the printed format in a new expressive substrate.  A new kind of binding, not a new kind of book." (Lanham 132)

"the institution of the library, which preserves these talismans and magic worlds for us, has always operated with a digital, not a fixed print, logic.  Books, the physical books themselves, were incidental to the real library mission, which was the dispersion of knowledge." (Lanham 135)

"We have been thinking about electronic text as the wrong type of revolution.  We have confused an extension of the Gutenberg revolution in replication and distribution with a revolution in expressive logic." (Lanham 144)


Chapter Five: Style/Substance Matrix

spectra of signal, perceiver, motive, life


Chapter Six: Barbie and the Teacher of Righteousness

completely bizarro dialogic chapter about intellectual property, I think...


Chapter Seven: The Audit of Virtuality

universities in the attention economy; comparison of online/offline campuses

"The tone and spirit of online writing changes when it leaves professorial imitations aside." (Lanham 235)

"Digital expression puts the classroom in the computer, not the computer in the classroom." (Lanham 235)

"consider the difference between Internet time and campus time. The Internet has speeded up the metabolism of thought and decision across the world of work. Everyone feels this, whatever endeavor they pursue.... Everyone feels this change, that is, except the university." (Lanham 247)

"Digital technology takes us back to the old, the prescientific and preindustrial economics, to the economics of attention that, in fact, prevailed in the medieval university." (Lanham 249)


Chapter Eight: Revisionist Thinking

"We are used to dealing with scarcity. THat has been our human lot since the beginning of history. Now we face plenitude. The solution? Find ways to transform it back into scarcity. In may ways this reversion helps but it does not seem, to me at least, a deep solution." (Lanham 257)
