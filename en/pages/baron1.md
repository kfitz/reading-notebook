new definitions of "reading" emerging in relationship to new devices and platforms

concerns about cognitive and pedagogical issues in relation to online/screen reading, including difficulty concentrating and ease of distraction, replacement of linearity by "skipping and skimming," declining ability to deal with lengthy texts

also concerns about issues surrounding the physicality of the book, some of which are emotional/aesthetic/nostalgic, and some of which have to do with issues of navigation, annotation, sociality, mnemonics, etc.

see Griswold, McDonnell, and Wright on the "self-perpetuating minority that we shall call the reading class" (qtd on 199)

see Jacobs on differing purposes for reading: "Education is and should be primarily about intellectual navigation, about . . . skimming well, and reading carefully for information in order to upload content. Slow and patient reading, by contrast, properly belongs to our leisure hours" (qtd on 199)

concludes with the suggestion that we are increasingly moving to a definition of reading in the digital age that "structurally privileges locating information over deciphering and analyzing more-complex text" (200)
