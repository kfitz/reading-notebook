Guillory, John. “Close Reading: Prologue and Epilogue.” ADE Bulletin (2010): 8–14.


explores the prologue (Richards) and epilogue (Hayles) to the formal practices known as close reading via the notion of attention, and how it may or may not be changing

Hayles's "Hyper and Deep Attention: The Generational Divide in Cognitive Modes"

"'deep attention' is 'the cognitive style traditionally associated with the humanities'; this style 'is characterized by concentrating on a single object for long periods (say, a novel by Dickens), ignoring outside stimuli while so engaged, preferring a single information stream, and having a high tolerance for long focus times.' Hyper attention, by contrast, 'is characterized by switching focus rapidly among different tasks, preferring multiple information streams, seeking a high level of stimulation, and having a low tolerance for boredom'" (8)

Hayles welcomes "the emergence of hyper attention as a new mode of cognition, supplementing though not replacing deep attention" (8)

"Hayles believes, probably rightly, that deep attention and hyper attention can happily coexist; her refusal to panic is an appealing alternative to either of two other possible responses to our cultural situation: on the one hand rejecting the new mode of cognition altogether, and on the other celebrating it for relegating deep attention to cultural obsolescence.... Yet what Hayles calls a 'synergistic combination of hyper and deep attention' suggests in the present circumstances that anything less than the synergistic ideal she calls for will result in an irreparable loss for the cultural works requiring deep attention." (9)

"It is perhaps a mistake to see the mode of deep attention as oriented mainly toward the long work -- that is, toward the question of the duration of attention. Poetry too, even short poems, demands sustained attention. The situation of poetry, I would suggest, is even more problematic than that of narrative prose, for reasons that concern the quality as much as the duration of attention." (9)

"there has been an erosion of deep attention and ... this erosion has created a problem for the literary curriculum" (10)

"If our educational institutions should fail to produce the desired synergy between deep and hyper attention, then the story of this failure might indeed be written as an epilogue for close reading. Hayles does not intend to write such an epilogue -- quite the contrary -- but her argument gives us an invaluable set of terms for understanding the cognitive foundation on which close reading is built up as a practice. I suggest that this way of thinking about close reading is more helpful at the moment than other attempts to write its epilogue deliberately, such as Franco Moretti’s argument for 'distant reading'" (10)

Kaiser Family Foundation Report (2005), _Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8–18 Year-Olds_

"The _Generation M_ study is more carefully framed than the NEA report, but its findings do not allay the anxiety expressed in _Reading at Risk_. The researchers for the Kaiser Foundation discovered that members of Generation M spend about 6.5 hours a day engaged with all media, including print. But traditional print forms such as novels, journals, and newspapers account for only .43 hours of this time expenditure." (11)

"Richards understood his task in teaching Cambridge undergraduates as the training of their literary judgment, which he hoped to put on a surer, scientific footing.... But judgment, he argued, depended on an underlying cognitive potentiality, which is the focusing of attention in reading. In the famous protocol experiment recorded in his successor volume, _Practical Criticism_, he demonstrated that his students were poor judges of literature because they were poor readers.... At base, then, the problem of reading could be understood as a matter of attention, of devising tactics for overcoming the 'inattentive activity' of our 'ordinary reading'." (12)

"Richards notoriously offered no positive methodology of reading, only a set of tactics for removing the sources of misreading. The development of positive interpretive techniques came later, with the New Criticism and after. Recalling this point forces us to see the gap between the psychology of reading and reading as a disciplinary practice, the gap that permits us to forget Richards’s psychology of reading, to forget that the prologue to close reading crucially involves the question of attention, the very psychological problematic we have seen reemerge in our time, the age of attention deficit disorder." (13)

"We must note, then, a certain inaccuracy in the notion of a generation M. It would be more faithful to the history of media to say that Richards was already confronting a media generation, a generation M1, and that Hayles is considering a later generation, M2 or possibly even some later iteration." (13)

"It would in my view be better not to blame the difficulty of reading literature today on new media, or on nonliterary writing. Media of themselves do not produce responses of a single, inexorably determined kind. On the contrary, close reading, if it means anything, holds out the possibility that deep attention can be paid to nearly any cultural artifact, even those that seek to impose a stock response on us. Conversely, much of what we mean now by close reading involves, as we all know, resistance to the seductions of the literary work itself, even the great work. In the meantime, we need to disabuse ourselves of the notion that there is an inherent conflict between literature and the new media and that this conflict can be posed as the difference between deep attention and hyper attention, whether we conceive the latter negatively or positively. Literature is a medium too." (13-14)
