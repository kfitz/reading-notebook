Meyer, Lars. Safeguarding Collections at the Dawn of the 21st Century: Describing Roles & Measuring Contemporary Preservation Activities in ARL Libraries. Association of Research Libraries, 2009.


"collaborative strategies are emerging as libraries develop new means for ensuring preservation of content needed to support current and future research and scholarship. Third party preservation of the type provided by Portico for journal preservation is one example, but collaborative activities enhancing preservation are also developing within consortia or through other multi-library programs like LOCKSS and CLOCKSS." (5)

"Improved cooperation and collaboration both within and among institutions is necessary to bring attention to and resolve common issues for the community." (8)

"Collaboration and the creation of shared community resources and preservation strategies are essential, particularly for digital content." (11)

"Digital preservation is a subset of preservation." (13)

"preservation, for the purposes of this report, includes all the activities related to stewardship of content, maintaining context, and ensuring continued access." (14)

"the preservation of born digital content must be managed along with the administrative, technical, structural, and descriptive metadata relevant to the digital content." (30)

"The research library community has clearly recognized the need to identify preservation solutions for e-journal content. In 2005, ARL endorsed a call that 'libraries must invest in a qualified archiving solution.' Several archiving options have emerged and many ARL libraries have signed on with Portico and/or the LOCKSS network. A number of libraries and publishers are working with LOCKSS to further develop the distributed preservation protocol and software to accommodate the needs of dark archives and large files of varying formats (CLOCKSS).
Many libraries have also aggressively pursued agreements with publishers for the right to access backfiles should a given publisher become unable to provide access to e-journal content or cease to exist altogether. These so called “trigger events” are the current focus of e-journal archiving efforts." (33)
