“the very ordering of our relations with one another, which I will call community, and the ways in which we talk about and communicate that being-together” (196)

“community, with its implicit sense of the common, is often conceived in terms of those things that are merely common among people; or more specifically, through the presence of what is presumably mutual. In the process, a philosophy of community emerges which runs the risk of operating on the basis of convenient oppositions between same and Other in which the bias of homogeneity is predominant.” (196)

— Maurice Blanchot, The Unavowable Community, “offers a daunting ethical formulation: ‘an infinite attention to the Other’ (43)” (198)
— Giorgio Agamben, The Coming Community
— Emmanuel Levinas, Totality and Infinity: “attention to the Other radically alters the construction of being and existence” (199)
— Jean-Luc Nancy, Community at Loose Ends: “community should be thought outside the bias of homogeneity and be based on what he calls ‘being-in-common,’ which forms the basis of a question” (201)

“The unavowable would be more attentive to loss since all is valued, language I employ to suggest the metanarrative character of the avowable structure.  I see the avowable as a story — with an already formulated beginning, middle, and end — that the avoué demands others to defend and vow allegiance to.” (204) — the unavowable community thus bears a relationship to the production of local narratives (rather than the adherence to existing ones?)

Bataille’s “distinction between what he calls traditional and elective communities, one that resonates with the difference between the avowable and the unavowable.  Stated simply, these two types of community differ on the basis of what unites them: facts or affinities” (205)
