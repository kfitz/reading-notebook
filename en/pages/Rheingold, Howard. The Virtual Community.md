Rheingold, Howard.  The Virtual Community:  Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier (1993), revised ed.  Cambridge:  MIT Press, 2000.

Introduction

“Finding the WELL was like discovering a cozy little world that had been flourishing without me, hidden within the walls of my house” (Rheingold xv).

“Computers and the switched telecommunication networks that also carry our telephone calls constitute the technical foundation of computer-mediated communications (CMC).  The technicalities of CMC, how bits of computer data move over wires and are reassembled as computer files at their destinations, are invisible and irrelevant to most people who use it, except when the technicalities restrict their access to CMC services.” (Rheingold xix-xx) — The same might be said of all computer technologies, and not simply about their functioning but about their material origins as well; as long as those who expect access have unimpeded access, the manufacturing and distribution of computer technologies do not matter to us at all.

“Cyberspace, originally a term from William Gibson’s science-fiction novel Neuromancer, is the name some people use for the conceptual space where words, human relationships, data, wealth, and power are manifested by people using CMC technology.” (Rheingold xx)

“Although spatial imagery and a sense of place help convey the experience of dwelling in a virtual community, biological imagery is often more appropriate to describe the way cyberculture changes.” (Rheingold xx)

“The vision of a citizen-designed, citizen-controlled worldwide communications network is a version of technological utopianism that could be called the vision of ‘the electronic agora.’  In the original democracy, Athens, the agora was the marketplace....  But another kind of vision could apply to the use of the Net in the wrong ways, a shadow vision of a less utopian kind of place — the Panopticon.” (Rheingold xxx)

1.  The Heart of the WELL

“virtual communities require more than words on a screen at some point if they intend to be other than ersatz” (Rheingold 8) — but what?

Rheingold quoted in Brand’s The Media Lab:  “There’s always another mind there.  It’s like having the corner bar, complete with old buddies and delightful newcomers and new tools waiting to take home and fresh graffiti and letters, except instead of putting on my coat, shutting down the computer, and walking down to the corner, I just invoke my telecom program and there they are.  It’s a place.” (Rheingold 9) — cyberspace = bar

Ray Oldenburg, The Great Good Place; three essential places:  live, work, conviviality; “These are the unacknowledged agorae of modern life.” (Rheingold 9)

“As one WELLite, John P. Barlow, said at the time, you aren’t a real community until you have a funeral.” (Rheingold 24)

2.  Daily Life in Cyberspace:  How the Computerized Counterculture Built a New Kind of Place

of his first encounters with the WELL:  “Writing as a performing art!” (Rheingold 25)

“No single metaphor completely conveys the nature of cyberspace.  Virtual communities are places where people meet, and they also are tools; the place-like aspects and tool-like aspects only partially overlap.” (Rheingold 45)

“Computer conference conversations are dialogues that are situated in a specific place (the conferencing system, the conference, the topic) and time.  The place is a cognitive and social one, not a geographic place.  The WELL is a kind of place to those who come to it...” (Rheingold 51)

“An architectural model of the WELL can help you create a mental model of these spaces within spaces.” (Rheingold 51) — a metaphoric model of a metaphoric space?

“The building is the conferencing system.  The rooms are the conferences.  And within each conference room, imagine a number of blackboards covered with writing.” (Rheingold 52)

ref. to Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities, mostly in suggesting that online communities, like the nation, require an act of imagination to come into existence

3.  Visionaries and Convergences:  The Accidental History of the Net

history of computer-mediated communication

“Time-sharing made it possible for individuals to interact directly with the computer.  The next bottleneck was the geographic distance between user and computer, and between computer and computer.  In the era of time-sharing, it was natural to ask, Why not extend the line of control and link computers up, through telecommunication lines, at a distance?” (Rheingold 66)

importance of packet-switching technology:  “this invention creates the building block for a communications system with no central control because you don’t need a central controller when each packet and the entire network of routers all know how to get information around.” (Rheingold 68)

“Gross and/or rapid changes in quantity can make for equally discontinuous changes in the quality of a phenomenon, when ‘emergent behaviors’ kick in.  When you can transfer the Library of Congress from one place to another in under a minute, the very notion of what it means to have a place called the Library of Congress changes.  As it goes digital, that place in Washington, D.C., is virtualizing.  I can already get the Library of Congress catalog from my desktop.  When I can download the source text itself to my desktop, my sense of where that information resides changes.  It’s at the other end of my modem line, along with the rest of the Net, which means it is more or less on my desktop.” (Rheingold 72-73)

John Quarterman, on the overcoming of physical space by virtual space:  “In two years, there will be more network users than residents of any state in the United States.  In five years there will be more network users than citizens of any single country except India or China.  What will happen when McLuhan’s global village becomes one of the largest countries in the world?  Using two-way communications, not broadcast?  And crossing boundaries of space, time, and politics?” (Rheingold 73)

4.  Grassroots Groupminds

anecdote about Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz, early developers and advocates of groupware:  “When we shared a train to Kyoto from Oita, in the southernmost part of Japan, I had the opportunity to talk with them about their role as early CMC enthusiasts.  They and their friends around the world had labored for years to use CMC as a means of achieving reconciliation, community, and enhanced communication.  Judging by the state of the world today, almost two decades after EIES opened, CMC has yet to make the world a more peaceful place in any perceptible way. / “Is it worth continuing to try?” was the question we had arrived at by the time the train pulled into the last major station before our destination.  We continued to talk with each other, but the three of us were looking out the window.  It was another medium-large Japanese city with standard postwar architecture, hard to distinguish from any other, but something about the shape of the landscape that framed it was very familiar to me.  I had seen that bowl of hills around the city, and that hill toward the center, in so many photographs.  It was Hiroshima Station.  We rode in silence for some minutes after that.” (Rheingold 115-16)

“If a BBS (computer Bulletin Board System) isn’t a democratizing technology, there is no such thing.  For less than the cost of a shotgun [!], a BBS turns an ordinary person anywhere in the world into a publisher, an eyewitness reporter, an advocate, an organizer, a student or teacher, and potential participant in a worldwide citizen-to-citizen conversation.” (Rheingold 133)

5.  Multi-User Dungeons and Alternate Identities

“MUDs are evidence that text still has its powers, even in this highly visual era.” (Rheingold 158-59)

MUDs and “topology”? not really considered, but raised

6.  Real-time Tribes

“IRC does not fit well with conventional theories of human communication because CMC technology makes possible something that human communicators could not do previously — a geographically dispersed group of people now can use the written word as a conversational medium.  So much of what scientists and scholars know about human communication involves physical presence or even potential physical presence, both totally absent from IRC.” (Rheingold 185)

IRC as playground

“Habitat was designed with a spatial metaphor in mind.” (Rheingold 197)

7.  Japan and the Net

TWICS and “the metaphorical electronic island Beejima: ‘Since we wanted to build a place where people would feel like they were members of something more than just another information service, we decided to use the metaphor of a community as the basic organizing principle for the new computer conferencing system we were going to install.  The image of Beejima was a friendly little island community in the electronic seas of Japan, close to Tokyo but accessible from anywhere...’” (Rheingold 225)

8.  Télématique and Messageries Roses:  A Tale of Two Virtual Communities

“Connectivity between networks is achieving a critical mass around the world — the means of jacking in are becoming more affordable every day, and the expertise needed to set up networks is diffusing rapidly.  Many countries will soon face the conflict that Japanese and French telecommunications planners must address:  to refuse to join the Net in its widest sense and face being left behind, or to join the Net and face social upheaval.” (Rheingold 253)

9.  Electronic Frontiers and Online Activists

“Uncapher declared his intention to observe the impact of CMC technology in the context of the community the technology was entering.  His thesis was that you can’t predict the way people will use communications technologies without knowing something about the social, economic, political, and cultural circumstances of the specific environments in which the technologies are introduced.  Uncapher hypothesized that the skills necessary to use the new technologies and the inspiration to adapt them to new uses would be unevenly distributed in each community.  Some groups would lack the skills, some groups would resist the changes, and the reasons for these reactions would be rooted not in technology but in local culture, economics, and politics.” (Rheingold 261)

birth of the Electronic Frontier Foundation

“The act of simply extending the Bill of Rights to that portion of cyberspace within U.S. jurisdiction would have an enormously liberating impact on the application of CMC to positive social purposes everywhere in the world.” (Rheingold 276)

CMC and online activism:  “The reach of the Net, like the reach of television, extends to the urbanized parts of the entire world (and, increasingly, to far-flung but telecom-linked rural outposts).” (Rheingold 284)

“cities in cyberspace” — Santa Monica’s PEN; Cleveland’s FreeNet

“Events of the spring and summer of 1993, when entertainment conglomerates, software companies, and telephone companies started jumping into bed with each other promiscuously, may have signaled the beginning of the end of the freewheeling frontier era of Net history.” (Rheingold 290)

10.  Disinformocracy

commodification and the public sphere; Habermas, Debord, Baudrillard

Carey, James.  “The Mythos of the Electronic Revolution.”  In Communication as Culture:  Essays on Media and Society.  Winchester, Mass.:  Unwin Hyman, 1989. — “the rhetoric of the ‘technological sublime’”

Winner, Langdon.  “Mythinformation.”

panopticon and the net

privacy and encryption

11.  Rethinking Virtual Communities

“The ‘Homesteading...’ subtitle of the first edition is obsolete and anachronistic today.” (Rheingold 325)

“Turkle doesn’t pretend to map the territory — indeed, she was the first to begin insisting that a vast psychic territory exists in cyberspace, waiting to be explored systematically by more than a few pioneer researchers.” (Rheingold 352-53)

need to note that in this chapter Rheingold responds to critiques of his assertion that community can be virtual, without addressing the question of the place-based metaphor:  “When asking questions about the impact of any technology on community, I have learned to avoid romanticizing the notion of community, of assuming a state of pastoral existence that once existed in pretechnology small towns.  There is an indisputable merit to living your life in the same place, loving or hating or putting up with the same people day after day, making decisions together with people you don’t necessarily like, reducing the number of your social relationships and perhaps increasing their depth.  But there is a cost to this long lost Gemeinschaft of the village, the hamlet, the small town, as well.  If the shadows of urban and mediated experience are alienation and superficiality, the shadows of the traditional community are narrow-mindedness and bigotry.” (Rheingold 361)

“Henry Ford paid his workers well enough, and made his Model T automobiles inexpensively enough that his employees could afford to buy them.  In February 2000, perhaps taking a leaf from the founder, the Ford Motor Company announced that it would make a personal computer, color printer, and Internet access available to each of its 350,000 employees for $5/month...” (Rheingold 378-79) — this seems to me to complete miss the point; the point of Ford’s pricing/wage system was that those who build the technology should be able to afford it; can those who build computers in Southeast Asia afford them?
