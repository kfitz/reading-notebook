Heidegger, Martin. “The Question Concerning Technology.” Basic Writings. Ed. David Farrell Krell. New York: HarperCollins, 1992. 307-41.


the question of the essence of technology:  a way of revealing (bringing forth) the totality of beings)

Krell (note? intro?):  "The technological framework is inherently expansionist and can reveal only by reduction.  Its attempt to enclose all beings in a particular claim -- utter availability and sheer manipulability -- Heidegger calls Ge-stell, 'enframing'" (Heidegger 309)

technology as means to an end; as human activity -- as man-made means to an end established by man (instrumentalism)

"the instrumental conception of technology conditions every attempt to bring man into the right relation to technology" (Heidegger 313) -- in other words, if technology were merely its instrumental definition, we'd only have to worry about making sure the end was good; we'd be the masters of technology

"Technology is therefore no mere means.  Technology is a way of revealing" (Heidegger 318)

"The revealing that rules in modern technology is a challenging, which puts to nature the unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be extracted and stored as such" (Heidegger 320)

man is more subject to technology than is nature -- is part of the "standing-reserve"

Gestell:  "the challenging claim that gathers man with a view to ordering the self-revealing as standing reserve" (Heidegger 324) = enframing

"Enframing is the gathering together which belongs to that setting-upon which challenges man and puts him in position to reveal the actual in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve" (Heidegger 329)

man exists wholly within the realm of enframing; cannot "take up" a relationship to it (for or against is meaningless)

"Technology is not demonic; but its essence is mysterious.  The essence of technology, as a destining of revealing, is the danger" (Heidegger 333)

"The threat to man does not come in the first instance from the potentially lethal machines and apparatus of technology.  The actual threat has already affected man in his essence" (Heidegger 333)
