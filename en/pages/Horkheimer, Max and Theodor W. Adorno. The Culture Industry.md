Horkheimer, Max and Theodor W. Adorno.  “The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Self-Deception.” Dialectic of Enlightenment.  1947.  New York: Continuum, 1993.


PREFACE

“a theory which holds that the core of truth is historical, rather than an unchanging constant to be set against the movement of history” (Horkheimer and Adorno ix)

“the related conversion of englightenment into positivism, the myth of things as they actually are, and finally the identification of intellect and that which is inimical to the spirit” (Horkheimer and Adorno x)

INTRODUCTION

“the discovery of why mankind, instead of entering into a truly human condition, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism” (Horkheimer and Adorno xi)

“When public opinion has reached a state in which thought inevitably becomes a commodity, and language the means of promoting that commodity . . .” (Horkheimer and Adorno xi-xii)

“the enigmatic readiness of the technologically educated masses to fall under the sway of any despotism” (Horkheimer and Adorno xiii)

“The dutiful child of modern civilization is possessed by a fear of departing from the facts which, in the very act of perception, the dominant conventions of science, commerce, and politics — cliché-like — have already molded; his anxiety is none other than the fear of social deviation.” (Horkheimer and Adorno xiv) — mass media as normative

“The essay on the ‘culture industry’ demonstrates the regression of enlightenment to ideology which finds its typical expression in cinema and radio.  Here enlightenment consists above all in the calculation of effectiveness and of the techniques of production and distribution; in accordance with its content, ideology expends itself in the idolization of given existence and of the power which controls technology.” (Horkheimer and Adorno xvi)

THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

“The sociological theory that the loss of the support of objectively established religion, the dissolution of the last remnants of precapitalism, together with technological and social differentiation or specialization, have led to cultural chaos is disproved every day; for culture now impresses the same stamp on everything.  Films, radio and magazines make up a system which is uniform as a whole and in every part.  Even the aesthetic activities of political opposites are one in their enthusiastic obedience to the rhythm of the iron system.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 120) — culture industry = fascism?

“the false identity of the general and the particular” (Horkheimer and Adorno 121) as contemporary culture?

“Movies and radio need no longer pretend to be art.  The truth that they are just business is made into an ideology in order to justify the rubbish they deliberately produce.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 121)

“The result is the circle of manipulation and retroactive need in which the unity of the system grows ever stronger.  No mention is made of the fact that the basis on which technology acquires power over society is the power of those whose economic hold over society is the greatest.  A technological rationale is the rationale of domination itself.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 121)

technology in culture has obliterated the distinction between economic and social world

distinction between telephone and radio: former “still allows the subscriber to play the role of subject”; latter is more “democratic,” but also centrally controlled, turning people into listeners (Horkheimer and Adorno 122)

“The attitude of the public, which ostensibly and actually favors the system of the culture industry, is a part of the system and not an excuse for it.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 122)

culture industry as giant machine

“In our age the objective social tendency is incarnate in the hidden subjective purposes of company directors” (Horkheimer and Adorno 122) — dependence of culture industry on larger military-industrial complex

television as end result of culture industry: all “arts” rolled into one, demonstrating virtual identity and sameness of everything

sameness, identity, interchangeability; “As soon as the film begins, it is quite clear how it will end, and who will be rewarded, punished, or forgotten.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 125)

all details/effects of work subordinated to formula

“The whole world is made to pass through the filter of the culture industry.  The old experience of the moviegoer, who sees the world outside as an extension of the film he has just left (because the latter is intent upon reproducing the world of everyday perceptions), is now the producer’s guideline. . . . Real life is becoming indistinguishable from the movies.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 126)

total lack of agency ascribed to audience/consumer; acknowledges some knowledge/effort must be used in apprehension of film, but still considers it passive

high/low split: jazz v. “serious music”

rebellion and experimentation as incorporated into system:  “Whenever Orson Welles offends against the tricks of the trade, he is forgiven because his departures from the norm are regarded as calculated mutations which serve all the more strongly to confirm the validity of the system.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 129)

style of the culture industry as the negation of style

“In the culture industry this imitation finally becomes absolute.  Having ceased to be anything but style, it reveals the latter’s secret: obedience to the social hierarchy.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 131)

culture industry as the goal of liberalism?

rebellion becomes a part of the system; dissidence is always “reconciled” (Horkheimer and Adorno 132)

when artist was subservient in hierarchical society, was at least aesthetically expert; now the artist is equal, but must be aethetically subservient

enslaved masses insist upon the myths which keep them in chains

postmodernism? — “A constant sameness governs the relationship to the past as well.  What is new about the phase of mass culture compared with the late liberal stage is the exclusion of the new.  The machine rotates on the same spot.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 134)

“The culture industry can pride itself on having energetically executed the previously clumsy transposition of art into the sphere of consumption, on making this a principle, on divesting amusement of its obtrusive naïvetés and improving the type of commodities.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 135)

“Anyone who complains that it [“light art”] is a betrayal of the ideal of pure expression is under an illusion about society.  The purity of bourgeois art, which hypostasized itself as a world of freedom in contrast to what was happening in the material world, was bought with the exclusion of the lower classes” (Horkheimer and Adorno 135)

business as the ideology of the culture industry

“the product prescribes every reaction” (Horkheimer and Adorno 137) — dumbness of audience

“The culture industry does not sublimate; it represses. . . . The Hays Office merely confirms the ritual of Tantalus that the culture industry  has established anyway.  Works of art are ascetic and unashamed; the culture industry is pornographic and prudish.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 140)

fun v. pleasure; fun v. happiness

“In films it is more strictly forbidden for an illegitimate relationship to be admitted without the parties being punished than for a millionaire’s future son-in-law to be active in the labor movement.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 141)

“The deception is not that the culture industry supplies amusement but that it ruins the fun by allowing business considerations to involve it in the ideological clichés of a culture in the process of self-liquidation.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 142-43)

“The fusion of culture and entertainment that is taking place today leads not only to a depravation of culture, but inevitably to an intellectualization of amusement.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 143)

“The element of blind chance in the routine decision about which song deserves to be a hit and which extra a heroine is stressed by the ideology.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 146) — gambling, W. Goldman: “no one knows anything”

culture industry demonstrates that abstract ideas, values, “truth” are cover for a sales pitch

“The culture industry tends to make itself the embodiment of authoritative pronouncements, and thus that irrefutable prophet of the prevailing order.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 147)

“In spite of all the progress in reproduction techniques, in controls and the specialties, and in spite of all the restless industry, the bread which the culture industry offers man is the stone of stereotype.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 148)

“Anyone who goes cold and hungry, even if his prospects were once good, is branded.  He is an outsider; and, apart from certain capital crimes, the most mortal of sins is to be an outsider.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 150)

“Tragedy is reduced to the threat to destry anyone who does not cooperate, whereas its paradoxical significance once lay in a hopeless resistance to mythic destiny.  Tragic fate becomes just punishment, which is what bourgeois aesthetics always tried to turn it into.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 152)

conflation of individual and general:  “What is individual is no more than the generality’s power to stamp the accidental detail so firmly that it is accepted as such.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 154) — “In this way mass culture discloses the fictitious character of the ‘individual’ in the bourgeois era . . . Individuation has never really been achieved.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 155)

drive for individuation replaced by drive for imitation (postmodernism!)

“For centuries society has been preparing for Victor Mature and Mickey Rooney.  By destroying they come to fulfill.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 156)

“With the cheapness of mass-produce luxury goods and its complement, the universal swindle, a change in the character of the art commodity itself is coming about.  What is new is not that it is a  commodity, but that today it deliberately admits that it is one; that art renounces its own autonomy and proudly takes its place among consumption goods constitutes the charm of novelty.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 157)

“In bringing cultural products wholly into the sphere of commodities, radio does not try to dispose of its culture goods themselves as commodities straight to the comsumer.  In America it collects no fees from the public, and so has acquired the illusory form of disinterested, unbiased authority which suits Fascism admirably.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 159)

merging of advertising and the culture industry

“The more completely language is lost in the announcement, the more words are debased as substantial vehicles of meaning and become signs devoid of quality” (Horkheimer and Adorno 164) — is he saying that language was once transparent, that there was a unity of sign and signifier which has been lost?

“Today the culture industry has taken over the civilizing inheritance of the entrepreneurial and frontier democracy — whose appreciation of intellectual deviation was never very finely attuned.” (Horkheimer and Adorno 166) — culture industry as normative; see Turner on frontier, Weber on capitalism
