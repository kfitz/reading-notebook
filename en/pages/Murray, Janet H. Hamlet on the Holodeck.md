Murray, Janet H.  Hamlet on the Holodeck:  The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace.  Cambridge, Mass.:  MIT Press, 1997.

Introduction:  A Book Lover Longs for Cyberdrama

“The birth of a new medium of communication is both exhilarating and frightening.  Any industrial technology that dramatically extends our capabilities also makes us uneasy by challenging our concept of humanity itself.” (Murray 1)

D. H. Lawrence, “Why the Novel Matters”

“Although the Computer is often accused of fragmenting information and overwhelming us, I believe this view is a function of its current undomesticated state.  The more we cultivate it as a tool for serious inquiry, the more it will offer itself as both an analytical and a synthetic medium.” (Murray 7)

“The computer is not the enemy of the book.  It is the child of print culture, a result of the five centuries of organized, collective inquiry and invention that the printing press made possible.” (Murray 8)

“...I find myself anticipating a new kind of storyteller, one who is half hacker, half bard.” (Murray 9)

Part I:  A New Medium for Storytelling

Chapter 1:  Lord Burleigh’s Kiss

Star Trek and the holonovel

“Will the increasingly alluring narrative spun out for us by the new digital technologies be as benign and responsible as a nineteenth-century novel or as dangerous and debilitating as a hallucinogenic drug?” (Murray 17) — this seems to me largely the wrong question; not only was the nineteenth century novel not seen as being ‘benign and responsible’ in its day — rather the opposite — but the threat that we sense in these new technologies is far less to ‘us’ than it is to our existing technologies and epistemologies, or to the sense of ‘us’ those technologies have created

“...the latest embodiment of the fear with which we have greeted every powerful new representational technology — from the bardic lyre, to the printing press, to the secular theatre, to the movie camera, to the television screen.” (Murray 18)

Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451

Chapter 2:  Harbingers of the Holodeck

the narrative computer is now in its incunabular days; nonetheless, we can see its possibilities in the non-linear, multiform stories that traditional media are straining to tell

multiform story = “a written or dramatic narrative that presents a single situation or plotline in multiple versions, versions that would be mutually exclusive in our ordinary experience” (Murray 30)

active audience

3-D movies

storytelling in electronic games

story webs

“While dramatic and written narrative traditions have moved closer to the computer and computer-based entertainments have become more storylike, computer science itself is moving into domains that were previously the province of creative artists.” (Murray 59) — VR, AI — (and here exactly lies the source of the problem for the novelist.  Imagine the terrors of the realist painter in the face of early photography:  what I have trained a lifetime to accomplish any bozo with a machine can now do in seconds.  What remains to be seen is how the novelists adapt, and what, exactly, their impressionist response might look like.)

expect a “continued loosening of the traditional boundaries between games and stories, between films and rides, between broadcast media (like television and radio) and archival media (like books or videotape), between narrative forms (like books) and dramatic forms (like theater or film), and even between the audience and the author.” (Murray 64)

Chapter 3:  From Additive to Expressive Form

“One of the lessons we can learn from the history of film is that additive formulations like ‘photo-play’ or the contemporary catchall ‘multimedia’ are a sign that the medium is in an early stage of development and is still depending on format derived from earlier technologies instead of exploiting its own expressive power.” (Murray 67)

creation of ELIZA in the late 60s, and Lumière-like creation legends:  “The story has become a legend because it discharges the anxiety aroused by the fear that Weizenbaum had gone too far, that he had created a being so much like an actual person that we would no longer be able to tell when we were talking to a computer and when to a human being.  This is very much like the fear that people would mistake film images for the real world.” (Murray 70)

“four principal properties” of digital environments:  they are procedural, participatory, spatial, and encyclopedic — making them interactive and immersive

Vannevar Bush, “As We May Think”; Ted Nelson, Literary Machines; Norbert Wiener, Cybernetics; Claus Emmeche, The Garden in the Machine

Part II:  The Aesthetics of the Medium

Chapter 4:  Immersion

creation of belief; structuring of participation

Chapter 5:  Agency

pleasures of navigation; rhizomatics

“In trying to create texts that do not ‘privilege’ any one order of reading or interpretive framework, the postmodernists are privileging confusion itself.” (Murray 133)

“Some have argued (with either elation or horror) that an interactor in a digital story — not just the improvising MUDder, but even the navigating reader of a postmodern hypertext — is the author of the story.  This is a misleading assertion.  There is a distinction between playing a creative role within an authored environment and having authorship of the environment itself.” (Murray 152)

“Authorship in electronic media is procedural.  Procedural authorship means writing the rules by which texts appear as well as writing the texts themselves.  It means writing the rules for the interactor’s involvement, that is, the conditions under which things will happen in response to the participant’s actions.” (Murray 152)

Chapter 6:  Transformation

kaleidoscopic narrative; mosaic

morphing story environments

enactment as transformation

refused closure

the multipositional view

Part III:  Procedural Authorship

Chapter 7:  The Cyberbard and the Multiform Plot

“What will it take for authors to create rich and satisfying stories that exploit the characteristic properties of digital environments and deliver the aesthetic pleasures the new medium seems to promise us?  We would have to find some way to allow them to write procedurally; to anticipate all the twists of the kaleidoscope, all the actions of the interactor; and to specify not just the events of the plot but also the rules by which those events would occur.  Writers would need a concrete way to structure a coherent story not as a single sequence of events but as a multiform plot open to the collaborative participation of the interactor.” (Murray 185)

oral bard as prototype; Propp and the bardic algorithm

however:  tendency of computer-driven algorithms to produce stereotypical thinking:  “We humans already do enough mechanical thinking without enlisting machines to help us.” (Murray 200)

very functionalist approach to storytelling:  structuralism/narratology

“A story is an act of interpretation of the world, rooted in the particular perceptions and feelings of the writer.  There is no mechanical way to substitute for this and no reason to want to do so.  Our question instead should be, How can we make this powerful new medium for multiform narrative as expressive of the writer’s voice as is the printed page?  The answer is in coming up with strategies for giving the author direct control over all the many levels of artistic choice.” (Murray 204)

Chapter 8:  Eliza’s Daughters

Julia the chatterbot; Girlfriend; Salesman

intelligent agents

Part IV:  New Beauty, New Truth

Chapter 9:  Digital TV and the Emerging Formats of Cyberdrama

internet serials; mobile viewer movies; virtual places; role-playing

Chapter 10:  Hamlet on the Holodeck

final chapter points to “real” fear behind anxieties about cyberfiction:  fear of loss of controlling artist, in two senses:  both fear of an uncontrolled universe and fear of collaborative efforts (fear of no author; fear of too many authors)
