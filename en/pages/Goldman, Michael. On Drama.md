(introduction)

“for many drama lovers the topic of genre, even the word genre itself, is likely to produce a chilling effect, a kind of eye-rolling impatience or dissatisfaction, which I have to admit I share.  Clearly, I confess this with some eagerness — because I think the very distaste that the topic can inspire gives us an unexpected clue to the role played by genre in the experience of drama.” (Goldman 1)

problems in the conception of genre:  drama is a genre (within literature), but it also has genre (comedy/tragedy/etc), and such genres have subgenres

considering genre as classification system is useless at best; “Everything changes, however, if we stop to think of genre as not entirely unlike rhyme, say, or ambiguity, as a feature, that is, whose primary interest for readers or audiences is as something that happens to us in a poem or play, as it happens.” (Goldman 3)

Derrida:  radical instability in genre, but no different from any taxonomic system

deconstructive bent tends to make genre disappear; “For our purposes it’s more valuable to see that, as it operates in drama, the instability of genre has a specific and unique texture.  We experience it not only as something that happens to us when we try to arrange dramas according to a coherent system of classification but, rather, as part of our ongoing recognition of what’s happening in the theater.” (Goldman 4)

Fowler:  genre is not taxonomic

“What I’m stalking under the cover of genre is the human weight of the processes of drama — what drama as a special kind of social practice does for and with our lives.” (Goldman 5)

special kind of urgency in study of drama at this moment

“For the purposes of this study I’m going to be considering the idea of genre only as it applies to drama.  But, though it’s convenient to put the apparently more general issue of literary genre to one side, it would be a grave mistake to assume that the issue of literary genre is the general issue — to assume, that is, that literature is the larger category, of which drama is a specialization.  Many problems not only in dramatic but literary theory would take on a sharply new perspective if, just to clear the air, let us say, we were to reverse the process and think instead of drama as the most general case of literature, with poetry, the novel, and so forth as specializations.  We might do well in fact to imagine drama as the originary literary or artistic form, if only to offset the myth, nowadays unacknowledged because epistemologically incorrect, but nevertheless dominant, of the literary origins of drama (from choral lyric, narrative, Solonic speeches in the agora, or whatever).  Actually, the old habit of thinking about drama as a genre of ‘literature,’ a habit seemingly as old as criticism itself, has worked to obscure some important connections between drama and life — especially with some features of life we’re likely today to regard as intensely difficult, issues that bear on self and meaning, on persons and texts, on identity and community.  Some consequences of such a change of perspective will be suggested in what follows.” (Goldman 6-7)

I

first function of genre:  to be recognized; if we can’t recognize it, we recognize that

importance of recognition in drama; see Aristotle’s Poetics

association of dramatic recognition with identification

doubleness of dramatic identification “springs, of course, from the actor’s status as someone who is most forcibly defined by taking on the definition of someone else” (Goldman 13)

“Consider how important to any dramatic process is the showing forth of the performer hidden in the role.  Whatever rhetoric of self-erasure, of ‘losing oneself in the part,’ may prevail at any historical moment, audiences go to the theater expecting and wanting to watch actors acting.” (Goldman 14)

II

centrality of identification to drama; theory must be expanded to include psychoanalytical conceptions of identification:  “the psychoanalytical process of identification, by its very nature, must act to destabilize identity, to render identity contradictory or incomplete.  Identification involves crossing the boundaries between self and other, outside and inside.” (Goldman 19)

tension between identifying oneself and identifying-with others

***[Note:  is this tension similar to that between the performative/normative construction of self and the theatrically performed deconstruction of self?]***

self as “an inherently self-undermining amalgam” (Goldman 19)

identification as ongoing process; not complete

“In ordinary life the ongoing process of identification is so volatile, complex, and improvised that we habitually conceal it.  We become adept as projecting an icon of ourselves, a readable mask that covers the moment-by-moment turbulence of our identifications.  How different this is from the way an actor dons, wields, comments on, animates, modifies, the changing masks of performance.  The way I, as an actor, identify my character to a theater audience is, in fact, more like the complex way I identify myself to myself than the relatively guarded way I identify myself to others.” (Goldman 21)

actor’s freedom to shift identities produces complex blend of attraction and aversion; relationship of attraction and aversion is “not only through the relatively simple mechanism of suppressed desire but also at a deeper level of identity formation” (Goldman 22); actor’s performance suggests a “threatening movement across internal boundaries” (Goldman 22); “Not I-am-becoming-somebody-else but I-am-becoming-somebody-else-yet-again.” (Goldman 22-23)

“Watching an actor is like seeing the inside of your head walking toward you.” (Goldman 24)

“As with Oedipus or Agave, to discover the identity of an Other who defines you, an Other who you are, is always a possible prelude to horror.  It’s the last thing we want, but we want it from theater.” (Goldman 26)

III

genre is about both the policing and the penetration of boundaries

Shakespearean drama often climaxes around a “cross-genre event” (Goldman 28), esp. scapegoats and fools

the thrill of genre is in its violation, in the forbidden, which genre theory attempts to conceal

genre functions by “advancing an illusion of origin, quite literally by dramatizing it” (Goldman 33)

“It is not only, then, that recognizable genre boundaries are often violated but that they seem to work dramatically by being violated, exactly to the extent an, in a sense, exactly at the point, that they are recognizable.” (Goldman 37)

IV

“if genre, at least in drama, seems to be about what gets excluded and, as it were, excluded in advance, it may be even more accurate to say that it’s about how certain things apparently destructive to the performance actually get included as we go along.” (Goldman 42-43)

V

“I’m suggesting, then, that we think of dramatic genre as part of a system of permeabilities, porous, flexible boundaries like the walls of a living cell, that admit, express, extend, and to a degree overcome the basic permeability anxieties of dramatic performance.  From the point of view of contemporary philosophy, the most interesting of those permeabilities may be the mutual permeability of actor and script, because it addresses our more-than-philosophical anxiety about the relation between persons and texts.  The popular poststructuralist view, of course, is that there is nothing that is not writing, nothing available to human understanding that is not a text, a semiotic system.  This view is crucially challenged by the phenomenon of theatrical performance, particularly by what we normally and perhaps misleadingly call subtext.” (Goldman 49)

“No matter how exhaustively one tries to translate what an actor does with a script into a kind of writeable commentary on it, there will always also remain the doing of it — the bodily life of the actor moving into the world, at a specific moment in time, to set in motion these words, these gestures, these writeable ideas, this other identity.  And, if the doing were itself to be reduced to a text, there would still be the doing of the doing.  The actor enters the text.” (Goldman 50)

consideration of this relationship to text as primary rather than derivative may allow us “to advance beyond some celebrated impasses in the theory of literature” (Goldman 51);

“Why do actors long to be ‘off book’?  They know that, as long as script is prior to performance, the play does not properly exist.  Memorizing a part is actually a means of freeing oneself from its mere textuality.” (Goldman 52)

VI

“flow”

VII

“the modern crisis of privacy” (Goldman 74):  “Our radical doubts about selfhood and identity seem the inevitable product of a long history of increasingly excruciating scrutiny of inward, private spaces.” (Goldman 74)

VIII

recognition and the face; modern art’s “uneasiness about the face”:  “This is not merely another example of the crisis of representation, though it suggests that a crisis of self-representation may underlie our general philosophical doubts about reference and signification.” (Goldman 99)

“For Emmanual Lévinas the face is above all the sign of a primitive responsibility to the Other.  Confronted with the absolute alterity of another face, I must respond; and only in responding do I have my being.  Being is thus a product of the en face relation, rather than the reverse.” (Goldman 100)

IX

“Performance does more than simply transmit a text or tell a tale.  Shakespeare is celebrating the fact that drama, this art of appearances, especially as his company con practice it, gets away with things, crosses boundaries that mere writing cannot.” (Goldman 112)

genre as a face?
