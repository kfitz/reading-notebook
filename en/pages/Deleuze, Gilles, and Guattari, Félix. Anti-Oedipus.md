Deleuze, Gilles, and Guattari, Félix.  Anti-Oedipus:  Capitalism and Schizophrenia (1972).  Minneapolis:  University of Minnesota Press, 1983.

Preface (Michel Foucault)

3 requirements for intellectual discourse in Europe between 1945 and 1965:  Marx, Freud, semiotics; 1965-1970 as revolutionary years

introduction of desire into thought, discourse & action

3 enemies confronted by Anti-Oedipus:  “terrorists of theory” who would preserve purity of politics; psychoanalysts and other “technicians of desire”; fascism, not just historically, but the will to power in us all

art of living counter to fascism:  free political action from paranoia; develop action, thought, and desire by proliferation and disjunction, not subdivision and hierarchization; withdraw allegiance from old categories of negative (lack, absence) and prefer the positive and multiple, difference over uniformity; do not think one has to be sad to be militant; do not use thought to ground practice in Truth, nor practice to discredit thought; do not focus on individual, but rather de-individualize; do not become enamored of power

Introduction (Mark Seem)

Anti-Oedipus as a kind of parallel venture to Nietzsche’s AntiChrist; psychoanalysis grounded in similar “herd instinct” to Christianity; desire for tranquilized security

based on the desire to be led — seen in fascism

both diagnostic and healing; schizoanalysis, beginning with the schizo, instead of the neurotic

“Against the Oedipal and oedipalized territorialities (Family, Church, School, Nation, Party), and especially the territoriality of the individual, Anti-Oedipus seeks to discover the ‘deterritorialized’ flows of desire, the flows that have not been reduced to the Oedipal codes and the neuroticized territorialities, the desiring-machines that escape such codes as lines of escape leading elsewhere.” (Seem xvii)

analysis from the extremes, not from the point of view of the “normal”

the experience of delirium

most Freud/Marx syntheses nonetheless read political economy and libidinal economy as separate; D&G read one economy of flows, both political and libidinal

confrontation between Marx & Nietzsche, in which Freud becomes “impossible”

“Oedipus is not a mere psychoanalytic construct… Oedipus is the figurehead of imperialism, ‘colonization pursued by other means, it is the interior colony…’ ” (Seem xx)

“Depression and Oedipus are agencies of the State, agencies of paranoia, agencies of power, long before being delegated to the family.” (Seem xx)

“the neurotic is the one on whom the Oedipal imprints take, whereas the psychotic is the one incapable of being oedipalized, even and especially by psychoanalysis” (Seem xxi); revolutionary must learn from psychotic how to shake off the yoke of Oedipus and initiate a “radical politics of desire”; freedom embodies by orphans, aetheists, nomads

“Anti-Oedipus is an individual or group that no longer functions in terms of beliefs and that comes to redeem mankind, as Nietzsche foresaw, not only from the ideals that weighed it down, ‘but also from that which was bound to grow out of it, the great nausea, the will to nothingness, nihilism…’ ” (Seem xxiii)

desire as revolutionary force

I.  The Desiring-Machines

1.  Desiring-Production

“Everywhere it is machines — real ones, not figurative ones:  machines driving other machines, machines being driven by other machines, with all the necessary couplings and connections” (Deleuze and Guattari 1) — “it” = replacement for id; machines as flows of desire/energy

“A schizophrenic out for a walk is a better model than a neurotic lying on the analyst’s couch” (Deleuze and Guattari 2)

“There is no such thing as either man or nature now, only a process that produces the one within the other and couples the machines together.  Producing-machines, desiring-machines everywhere, schizophrenic machines, all of species life:  the self and the non-self, outside and inside, no longer have any meaning whatsoever” (Deleuze and Guattari 2)

Oedipus is not a given; “Oedipus presupposes a fantastic repression of desiring-machines” (Deleuze and Guattari 3)

(is their use of “machine” meant to emphasize interconnection? — used in place of “subject,” to de-emphasize the individual and instead focus on flows)

“the real truth of the matter — the glaring, sober truth that resides in delirium — is that there is no such thing as relatively independent spheres or circuits:  production is immediately consumption and a recording process (enregistrement), without any sort of mediation, and the recording process and consumption directly determine production, though they do so within the production process itself” (Deleuze and Guattari 4)

man as “the eternal custodian of the machines of the universe” (Deleuze and Guattari 4), inseparable from nature, not lord over it

desiring-machines are binary machines

“Desire constantly couples continuous flows and partial objects that are by nature fragmentary and fragmented.  Desire causes the current to flow, itself flows in turn, and breaks the flows” (Deleuze and Guattari 5)

“Producing is always something ‘grafted onto’ the product; and for that reason desiring-production is production of production, just as every machine is a machine connected to another machine” (Deleuze and Guattari 6)

“The schizophrenic is the universal producer” (Deleuze and Guattari 7); “The rule of continually producing production, of grafting producing onto the product, is a characteristic of desiring-machines or of primary production:  the production of production” (Deleuze and Guattari 7)

“Desiring-machines make us an organism; but at the very heart of this production, within the very production of this production, the body suffers from being organized in this way, from not having some other sort of organization, or no organization at all….  The full body without organs is the unproductive, the sterile, the unengendered, the unconsumable” (Deleuze and Guattari 8)

2.  The Body without Organs

apparent conflict between desiring-machines and the body without organs

“This is the real meaning of the paranoiac machine:  the desiring-machines attempt to break into the body without organs, and the body without organs repels them, since it experiences them as an over-all persecution apparatus” (Deleuze and Guattari 9)

parallel between desiring-production and social production

capital as the body without organs of the capitalist

“The body without organs, the unproductive, the unconsumable, serves as a surface for the recording of the entire process of production of desire, so that desiring-machines seem to emanate from it in the apparent objective movement that establishes a relationship between the machines and the body without organs” (Deleuze and Guattari 11)

“does the recording of desire go by way of the various stages in the formation of the Oedipus complex?  Disjunctions are the form that the genealogy of desire assumes; but is this genealogy Oedipal, is it recorded in the Oedipal triangulation?  Is it not more likely that Oedipus is a requirement or a consequence of social reproduction, insofar as this latter aims at domesticating a genealogical form and content that are in every way intractable?” (Deleuze and Guattari 13)

body without organs rejects “attempt to impose on it any sort of triangulation implying that it was produced by parents” (Deleuze and Guattari 15)

code of delirium or desire as means of escaping social code; schizophrenic deliberately scrambles all the codes

3.  The Subject and Enjoyment

role of pleasure in desiring-production

opposition between desiring-machines and the body without organs (seen in the paranoiac machine) gives way to an attraction in the miraculating machine; celibate machine succeeds the paranoiac machine and the miraculating machine, “forming a new alliance between the desiring-machines and the body without organs so as to give birth to a new humanity or a glorious organism” (Deleuze and Guattari 17)

subject as “mere residuum” of desiring-machines

“How is it possible that the schizo was conceived of as the autistic rag — separated from the real and cut off from life — that he is so often thought to be?  Worse still:  how can psychiatric practice have made him this sort of rag, how can it have reduced him to this state of a body without organs that has become a dead thing — this schizo who sought to remain at that unbearable point where mind touches matter and lives its every intensity, consumes it?  And shouldn’t this question immediately compel us to raise another one, which at first glance seems quite different:  how does psychoanalysis go about reducing a person, who this time is not a schizophrenic but a neurotic, to a pitiful creature who eternally consumes daddy-and-mommy and nothing else whatsoever?” (Deleuze and Guattari 19-20)

4.  A Materialist Psychiatry

“Delirium is in fact characteristic of the recording that is made of the process of production of the desiring-machines” (Deleuze and Guattari 22)

materialist psychiatry requires “introducing desire into the mechanism, and introducing production into desire” (Deleuze and Guattari 22)

“the analytic imperialism of the Oedipus complex”; “Freud doesn’t like schizophrenics.  He doesn’t like their resistance to being oedipalized, and tends to treat them more or less as animals.  They mistake words for things, he says” (Deleuze and Guattari 23)

“from the moment that we are placed within the framework of Oedipus…the cards are stacked against us, and the only real relationship, that of production, has been done away with” (Deleuze and Guattari 24)

traditional Platonic logic of desire is all wrong, in placing desire on the side of acquisition, making it all about lack; “when the theoretician reduces desiring-production to a production of fantasy, he is content to exploit to the fullest the idealist principle that defines desire as a lack, rather than a process of production, of ‘industrial’ production” (Deleuze and Guattari 26)

“Desire does not lack anything; it does not lack its object.  It is, rather the subject that is missing in desire, or desire that lacks a fixed subject; there is no fixed subject unless there is repression.  Desire and its object are one and the same thing:  the machine, as a machine of a machine.  Desire is a machine, and the object of desire is another machine connected to it” (Deleuze and Guattari 26)

“The truth of the matter is that social production is purely and simply desiring-production itself under determinate conditions.  We maintain that the social field is immediately invested by desire, that it is the historically determined product of desire, and that libido has no need of any mediation or sublimation, any psychic operation, any transformation, in order to invade and invest the productive forces and the relations of production.  There is only desire and the social, and nothing else” (Deleuze and Guattari 29)

why we desire our own oppression; Reich:  “the masses were not innocent dupes; at a certain point, under a certain set of conditions, they wanted fascism” (Deleuze and Guattari 29)

“desire produces reality, or stated another way, desiring-production is one and the same thing as social production” (Deleuze and Guattari 30)

desiring-machines continually break down as they run, and in fact only run when they are not functioning properly

desiring-production as the site of primal psychic repression; social production as site of social repression

“Is it correct to say that in this sense schizophrenia is the product of the capitalist machine, as manic-depression and paranoia are the product of the despotic machine, and hysteria the product of the territorial machine?” (Deleuze and Guattari 33)

“What we are really trying to say is that capitalism, through its process of production, produces an awesome schizophrenic accumulation of energy or charge, against which it brings all its vast powers of repression to bear, but which nonetheless continues to act as capitalism’s limit” (Deleuze and Guattari 34) — capitalism’s fatal contradictions (deterritorialization and reterritorialization, etc.)

“Schizophrenia is desiring-production as the limit of social production.  Desiring-production, and its difference in régime as compared to social production, are thus end points, not points of departure” (Deleuze and Guattari 35)

5.  The Machines

a machine as a system of interruptions or breaks; “every machine functions as a break in the flow in relation to the machine to which it is connected, but at the same time is also a flow itself, or the production of a flow, in relation to the machine connected to it” (Deleuze and Guattari 36)

must distinguish breaks that are detachments from breaks that are slicing-off; break as heterogeneous chain

third type of break:  the residual break, producing a subject alongside the machine

6.  The Whole and Its Parts

re their choice of Melanie Klein:  “If we here choose the example of the analyst least prone to see everything in terms of Oedipus, we do so only in order to demonstrate what a forcing was necessary for her to make Oedipus the sole measure of desiring-production.  And naturally this is all the more true in the case of run-of-the-mill practitioners who no longer have the slightest notion of what the psychoanalytic ‘movement’ is all about.  It is no longer a question of suggestion, but of sheer terrorism” (Deleuze and Guattari 45)

“A desiring-machine and a partial object do not represent anything” (Deleuze and Guattari 47)

“Is it possible that, by taking the path that it has, psychoanalysis is reviving an age-old tendency to humble us, to demean us, and to make us feel guilty?” (Deleuze and Guattari 50)

II.  Psychoanalysis and Familialism:  The Holy Family

1.  The Imperialism of Oedipus

flows of desire are sacrificed in early psychoanalysis to the imperialism of Oedipus, as is the whole of desiring-production crushed by representation

2.  Three Texts of Freud

controversy resulting from Melanie Klein’s attempts to define the forces of the female sexual organ positively rather than negatively; Freud insists no, it results from lack

“This is perhaps no longer the case when the partial object is posited for itself on the body without organs, with — as its sole subject — not an ‘ego,’ but the drive that forms the desiring-machine along with it, and that enters into relationships of connection, disjunction, and conjunction with other partial objects, at the core of the corresponding multiplicity whose every element can only be defined positively.  We must speak of ‘castration’ in the same way we speak of oedipalization, whose crowning moment it is:  castration designates the operation by which psychoanalysis castrates the unconscious, injects castration into the unconscious” (Deleuze and Guattari 60)

women’s liberation movements

in institutional analysis, group fantasy replaces individual fantasy; all fantasy is group fantasy; attempts to trace a path between the repressiveness of the hospital and the hypocritical nature of contractual analysis

“And above all, what brings about our sickness?  Schizophrenia itself, as a process?  Or is it brought about by the frantic neuroticization to which we have been delivered, and for which psychoanalysis has invented new means — Oedipus and castration?” (Deleuze and Guattari 67-68)

3.  The Connective Synthesis of Production

“In contrast to the alternative of the ‘either/or’ exclusions, there is the ‘either…or… or’ of the combinations and permutations where differences amount to the same without ceasing to be differences” (Deleuze and Guattari 69-70)

two uses of connective synthesis:  global and specific, and partial and nonspecific

4.  The Disjunctive Synthesis of Recording

two uses of disjunctive synthesis:  exclusive and restrictive vs. inclusive and non restrictive; immanent vs. transcendent

the Oedipal double-bind; “The possibility of living beyond the father’s law, beyond all law, is perhaps the most essential possibility brought forth by Freudian psychoanalysis.  But paradoxically, and perhaps because of Freud, everything leads us to conclude that this release, made possible by psychoanalysis, will be achieved, is already being achieved, outside it” (Deleuze and Guattari 81)

but “the problem is not resolved until we do away with both the problem and the solution” (Deleuze and Guattari 81)

“The true difference in nature is not between the Symbolic and the Imaginary, but between the real machinic (machinique) element, which constitutes desiring-production, and the structural whole of the Imaginary and the Symbolic, which merely forms a myth and its variants” (Deleuze and Guattari 83)

5.  The Conjunctive Synthesis of Consumption-Consummation

segregative and biunivocal vs. nomadic and polyvocal

“The first things to be distributed on the body without organs are races, cultures, and their gods” (Deleuze and Guattari 85)

members of supposedly oedipalized triangle are in fact “at grips with, and coupled to, the elements of the political and historical situation” (Deleuze and Guattari 97); “The family does not engender its own ruptures.  Families are filled with gaps and transected by breaks that are not familial” (Deleuze and Guattari 97)

“Schizoanalysis therefore does not hide the fact that it is a political and social psychoanalysis, a militant analysis:  not because it would go about generalizing Oedipus in culture, under the ridiculous conditions that have been the norm until now.  It is a militant analysis, on the contrary, because it proposes to demonstrate the existence of an unconscious libidinal investment of sociohistorical production, distinct from the conscious investments coexisting with it” (Deleuze and Guattari 98)

“the goal of schizoanalysis:  to analyze the specific nature of the libidinal investments in the economic and political spheres, and thereby to show how, in the subject who desires, desire can be made to desire its own repression” (Deleuze and Guattari 105)

“For reading a text is never a scholarly exercise in search of what is signified, still less a highly textual exercise in search of a signifier.  Rather it is a productive use of the literary machine, a montage of desiring-machines, a schizoid exercise that extracts from the text its revolutionary force” (Deleuze and Guattari 106)

6.  A Recapitulation of the Three Syntheses

“Schizoanalysis is at once a transcendental and a materialist analysis.  It is critical in the sense that it leads the criticism of Oedipus, or leads Oedipus, to the point of its own self-criticism.  It sets out to explore a transcendental unconscious, rather than a metaphysical one; an unconscious that is material rather than ideological; schizophrenic rather than Oedipal; nonfigurative rather than imaginary; real rather than symbolic; machinic rather than structural — an unconscious, finally, that is molecular, microphysical, and micrological rather than molar or gregarious; productive rather than expressive” (Deleuze and Guattari 109-110)

7.  Social Repression and Psychic Repression

psychic repression is unconscious, both in operation and in result, thus differentiating it from social repression — but not really independent

8.  Neurosis and Psychosis

Freud’s distinction far too simple; two categories cannot be effectively distinguished; desiring-production as cause of both

9.  The Process

is psychosis the process, or an interruption of the process?

“Schizophrenia as process is desiring-production, but it is this production as it functions at the end, as the limit of social production determined by the conditions of capitalism.  It is our very own ‘malady,’ modern man’s sickness” (Deleuze and Guattari 130)

III.  Savages, Barbarians, Civilized Men

1.  The Inscribing Socius

“universal history is the history of contingencies, and not the history of necessity.  Ruptures and limits, and not continuity” (Deleuze and Guattari 140); “universal history is not only retrospective, it is also contingent, singular, ironic, and critical” (Deleuze and Guattari 140)

distinction between technical machines, which have nonhuman elements that extend human strength, and the social machine, which “has men for its parts” (141); “The same machine can be both technical and social, but only when viewed from different perspectives:  for example, the clock as a technical machine for measuring uniform time, and as a social machine for reproducing canonic hours and for assuring order in the city” (Deleuze and Guattari 141)

2.  The Primitive Territorial Machine

filiation v. alliance; kinship rules

3.  The Problem of Oedipus

early kinship rules preventing incest not about incest but about exchange; Oedipus’s foundation in incest therefore misguided

4.  Psychoanalysis and Ethnology

connection of Oedipus and colonialism:  “Oedipus is euthanasia within ethnocide” (Deleuze and Guattari 169)

“Culturalists and ethnologists have demonstrated that institutions are primary in relation to affects and structures.  For structures are not mental, they are present in things (elles sont dans les choses), in the forms of social production and reproduction” (Deleuze and Guattari 173) — but one of those institutions is the family, and thus this kind of analysis is susceptible to Oedipalism

5.  Territorial Representation

representation is always a social and psychic repression; system of repression comprises three elements:  the repressed representative, the repressing representation, and the displaced represented

social inscription as agent of repression; society not exchangist, but inscriptive, “not exchanging but marking bodies” (Deleuze and Guattari 185); debt as consequence of territorial inscription

end of territorial machine comes in uprising of barbarian

6.  The Barbarian Despotic Machine

despot as paranoiac; “every time the categories of new alliance and direct filiantion are mobilized, we are talking about the imperial barbarian formation or the despotic machine” (Deleuze and Guattari 193)

associated with Marx’s definition of “Asiatic” production (?)

money as a means of “rendering the debt infinite.  And that is what is concealed in the two acts of the State:  the residence or territoriality of the State inaugurates the great movement of deterritorialization that subordinates all the primitive filiations to the despotic machine (the agrarian problem); the abolition of debts or the accountable transformation initiates the duty of an interminable service to the State that subordinates all the primitive alliances to itself (the problem of debts)” (Deleuze and Guattari 197)

7.  Barbarian or Imperial Representation

despot’s privileged access to incest; as incest was never really the desire, but rather its displaced represented, “the royal barbarian incest is merely the means to overcode the flows of desire, certainly not a means to liberate them.” (Deleuze and Guattari 201-202)
