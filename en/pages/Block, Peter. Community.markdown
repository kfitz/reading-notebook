# Block, Peter. Community

Block, Peter. _Community: The Structure of Belonging_. Berrett-Koehler, 2008.

## Welcome

“Community as used here is about the experience of belonging…. First and foremost, to belong is to be related to and a part of something.” (12/318)

“The second meaning of the word _belong_ has to do with being an owner: Something belongs to me.” (12)

“The work, then, is to seek in our communities a wider and deeper sense of emotional ownership; it means fostering among all of a community’s citizens a sense of ownership and accountability.” (12)

“Belonging can also be thought of as a longing to be…. Community is the container within which our longing to be is fulfilled.” (12)

“My intent in this book is to give definition to ways of structuring the experience of belonging” (13)

“The promise of what follows is to provide structural ways to create the experience of belonging, not only in places where people come just to be together socially, but especially in places where we least expect it. These include all the places where people come together to get something done — our meetings, dialogues, conferencces, planning processes, all those gatherings where we assemble to reflect on and decide the kind of future we want for ourselves.” (13)

## Introduction: The Fragmented Community and Its Transformation

“The essential challenge is to transform the isolation and self-interest within our communities into connectedness and caring for the whole…. We begin by shifting our attention from the problems of community to the possibility of community.” (15)

“Our communities are separated into silos; they are a collection of institutions and programs operating near one another but not overlapping or touching. This is important to understand because it is this dividedness that makes it so difficult to create a more positive or alternative future — especially in a culture that is much more interested in individuality and independence than in interdependence.” (16)

“The cost of our detachment and disconnection is not only our isolation, our loneliness, but also the fact that there are too many people in our communities whose gifts remain on the margin.” (17)

“Community offers the promise of belonging and calls for us to acknowledge our interdependence. To belong is to act as an investor, owner, and creator of this place. To be welcome, even if we are strangers…. To feel a sense of belonging is important because it will lead us from conversations about safety and comfort to other conversations, such as our relatedness and willingness to provide hospitality and generosity.” (17-18)

“generosity is an offer with no expectation of return” (18)

“I want to explore a way of thinking that creates an opening for authentic communities to exist and details what each of us can do to make that happen…. By thinking in terms of a structure of belonging, we begin to build the capacity to transform our communities into ones that work for all.” (18-19)

“We need ideas from a variety of places and disciplines to deal with the complexity of community. Then, acting as if these ideas are true, we must translate them into embarrassingly simple and concrete acts.” (19)

“We know a good deal about individual transformation, but our understanding about the transformation of human systems, such as our workplaces, neighborhoods, and towns, is primitive at best, and too often naive in the belief that if enough individuals awaken, and become intentional and compassionate beings, the shift in community will follow.” (19)

“the transformation of large numbers of individuals does not result in the transformation of communities. If we continue to invest in individuals as the primary target of change, we will spend our primary energy on this and never fully invest in communities.” (20)

“Social capital is about acting on and valuing our interdependence and sense of belonging. It is the extent to which we extend hospitality and affection to one another.” (21)

“If you look closely, you realize that the social fabric of our culture is more fragile than we imagine.” (22)

## Part One: The Fabric of Community

“What makes community building so complex is that it occurs in an infinite number of small steps, sometimes in quiet moments that we notice out of the corner of our eye.” (23)

“weaving and strengthening the fabric of community is a collective effort and starts from a shift in our mindset about our connectedness.” (24)

### Chapter 1: Insights into Transformation

other authors whose work has provided insight into the nature of community

John McKnight: “Communities are built from the assets and gifts of their citizens, not form the citizens’ needs or deficiencies. Organized, professionalized systems are capable of delivering services, but only associational life is capable of delivering care. Sustainable transformation is constructed in those places where citizens choose to come together to produce a desired future.” (28-29)

Werner Erhard: “a shift in speaking and listening is the essence of transformation” (29); “the way we function is powerfully impacted by our worldview” (30); “Possibility… is a declaration, a declaration of what we create in the world each time we show up. It is a condition, or value, that we want to occur in the world” (30-31); “it is the future that one lives into that shapes one’s being and action in the present… the reason it appears that it is the past that shapes one’s being and action in the present is that for most people the past lives in (shapes) their view of the future” (31)

Robert Putnam: “the one thing that distinguished the more successful from the less successful towns was the extent of social capital, or widespread relatedness that existed among its citizens” (32); distinguishes bonding social capital (inward-facing connections among the like-minded) and bridging social capital (outward-looking connections bringing together different types of people), emphasizing the importance of the latter

Christopher Alexander: importance of creating structures that have “a quality of aliveness,” which “grows out of a sense of wholeness” (34); “The task of transformation is to operate so that what we create grows organically, more concerned with the ‘quality of aliveness’ that gives us the experience of wholeness than with a predictable destination and the speed with which we can reach it.” (35-36)

Peter Koestenbaum: “It is the willingness to reframe, turn, and even invert a question that creates the depth and opening for authentic change” (37); key is “the search for human freedom — freedom being the choice to be a creator of our own experience and accept the unbearable responsibility that goes with that” (37); “freedom is what creates accountability” (37)

large group methodology: “means of creating the experience of democracy and high engagement” (38); gives several examples of the ways that practitioners approach conversations about change with large groups

“What we may once have relegated as useful but incidental little ‘training exercises’ now have a power beyond our imagination. They form a way of thinking and operating in community that, when matched with the philosophical insights of the others, give us the structure of belonging we seek.” (41)

“people will be accountable and committed to what they have a hand in creating.” (41); “This insight is an argument for collective intelligence and an argument against expensive studies and specialized expertise” (41); “all voices need to be heard, but not necessarily all at one time or by everybody… peer-to-peer interaction is where most learning takes place” (42); “transformation hinges on changing the structure of how we engage each other” (42)

David Bornstein: “Changes that begin on a large scale, are initiated or imposed from the top, and are driven to produce quick wins inevitably produce few lasting results” (43); “sustainable changes in community occur locally on a small scale, happen slowly, and are initiated at a grassroots level” (44)

Allan Cohen: “effective change strategies obviously begin with a strong sense of purpose plus a commitment to bring something new into the world. // The key is what you do after that.” (44); “take modest steps to impact the conversations and relationships that are shaping the direction of change inherent in the organization. Watch what emerges, pause, reflect, and course correct — then watch what emerges again” (44)

### Chapter 2: Shifting the Context for Community

“The context that restores community is one of possibility, generosity, and gifts, rather than one of problem solving, fear, and retribution.” (47)

“The following are the shift in context that owuld signal a transformation into authentic community:
- We are a community of possibilities, not a community of problems.
- Community exists for the sake of belonging and takes its identity from the gifts, generosity, and accountability of its citizens. It is not defined by its fears, its isolation, or its penchant for retribution.
- We currently have all the capacity, expertise, programs, leaders, regulations, and wealth required to end unnecessary suffering and create an alternative future.” (47-48)

principles of strategy: “The essential work is to build social fabric, both for its own sake and to enable chosen accountability among citizens…. Care and accountability create a healthy community” (48); “Strong associational life is essential and central. Associational life is the volitional aspect of community. It is how citizens choose to build connections for their own sake, usually for common purpose” (48-49); “Citizens who use their power to convene other citizens are what create an alternative future…. A shift in the thinking and actions of citizens is more vital than a shift in the thinking and action of institutions and formal leaders” (49); “The small group is the unit of transformation… we must set aside our concern for scale and our concern for speed” (49); “All transformation is linguistic, which means that we can think of community as essentially a conversation…. The shift in conversation is from one of problems, fear, and retribution to one of possibility, generosity, and restoration” (49-50)

“We believe that defining, analyzing, and studying problems is the way to make a better world. It is the dominant mindset of western culture.” (51) And the dominant mindset of academic culture, where we believe that critique is the path toward greater insight; what if we were to change the conversation to one about generosity and possibility?

“Community-as-problems-to-be-solved has some benefits. It values the ability to implement, is big on doing, has a certain honesty about it, and worships tangible results as the ultimate blessing.” (52)

“Safety, jobs, housing, and the rest are symptoms of the unreconciled and fragmented nature of the community — what Lopez calls the breakdown of community… trying to solve the symptoms only sustains them.” (53)

“At every level of society, we live in the landscape of retribution. The retributive community is sustained by several aspects of the modern community conversation, which I will expand on throughout the book: the marketing of fear and fault, gravitation toward more laws and oversight, an obsession with romanticized leadership, marginalizing hope and possibility, and devaluing associational life to the point of invisibility.” (53-54)

on telling our story: “We need to distinguish between the stories that give meaning to our lives and help us find our voice, and those that limit our possibility.” (54)

“Limiting stories are the ones that present themselves as if they were true. Facts…. The decision to tell those stories over and over again as if they were defining truths creates the limitation against an alternative future.” (55)

### Chapter 3: The Stuck Community

“To create a new story, we first need to come to terms with the current one.” (57)

“The marketing of fear is not just for profit; it also holds a political agenda. Fear justifies the retributive agenda, fundamentalist in the extreme, that has been on the rise for some time. The retributive agenda believes that a just and civil society is one that gives priority to restraints, consequences, and control, and underlines the importance of rules.” (58)

“In addition to marketing fear, the stuck community markets fault.” (59)

“Out of the decision to dwell on fear and fault, the community is stuck in a context that holds the following:
- We are a community of problems to be solved…
- The future is defined by the interplay of self-interests, dependent on the accountability of leaders, and controlled by a small number of wealthy and powerful people…
- Community action is aimed at eliminating the sources of our fear” (59)

“The political agenda of the stuck community says that citizens and employees are incapable of monitoring themselves and controlling each other, and that more careful oversight, institutionally mandated and installed, will build community and provide for the common good.” (61)

“We are fascinated with our leaders. We speak endlessly, both in the public conversation and privately, about the rise and fall of leaders. The agenda this sustains is that leaders are cause and all others are effect. That all that counts is what leaders do…. This is a deeply patriarchal agenda” (61)

“Decide that all the news fit to print is about problems, and that is what you get. In the retributive culture, cynicism is the norm and becomes the lead story. Cynicism justifies retribution. Retribution is fueled by cynicism.” (63)

possibility is dismissed as “a ‘human interest’ piece” when reported in the news (63) or as “optimism” (64); “But possibility is not a prediction, or a goal; it is a choice to bring a certain quality into our lives.” (64)

“All that does not confirm the prevailing mindset is made marginal and cute.” (64)

John McKnight has argued that “community is built most powerfully by what he calls ‘associational life,’ referring to the myriad ways citizens come together to do good work and serve the public interest” (64)

“‘Not for profit’ means that service and generosity are defined by what it is not. What kind of identity and esteem does this establish for the choice for service and care for community?” (65)

“Associations are under constant pressure to be more corporate: to merge, become more efficient, submit to external oversight, measure harder, and submit to greater accountability” (65-66)

“Retribution by its nature serves to fragment community and reduce social capital. The side effect is that each citizen’s accountability for the well-being of community is reduced.” (67)

“The media’s power is the power to name the public debate. Or, in other words, the power to name ‘reality.’ This is true for the mainstream as well as online media. // The point is this: Citizens have the capacity to change the community story, to reclaim the power to name what is worth talking about, to bring a new context into being.” (69)

### Chapter 4: The Restorative Community

“Restoration comes from the choice to value possibility and relatedness over problems, self-interest, and the rest of the stuck community’s agenda. It hinges on the accountability chosen by citizens and their willingness to connect with each other around promises they make to each other…. Shifting the context from retribution to restoration will occur through language that moves in the following directions: from problems to possibility; from fear and fault to gifts, generosity, and abundance; from law and oversight to social fabric and chosen accountability; from corporation and systems to associational life; and from leaders to citizens.” (70)

“the essential aspect of the restoration of community is a context in which each citizen chooses to be accountable rather than entitled.” (71)

“Accountability is the willingness to care for the whole…. It means we have conversations of what we can do to create the future. Entitlement is a conversation about what others can or need to do to create the future for us.” (71)

“This question of what we can create together is at the intersection of possibility and accountability. Possibility without accountability results in a wishful thinking. Accountability without possibility creates despair” (72)

“The intent of restoration in the criminal justice system is to provide a more healing path for both the offender and the victim of a crime” (76)

“A possibility, when declared publicly, heard and witnessed by others with whom we have a common interest, at a moment when something is at stake, is a critical element of communal transformation. This public conversation creates a larger relatedness and transcends a simply individual transformation.” (78)

### Chapter 5: Taking Back Our Projections

“The reason the retributive context cannot improve the conditions it tries to heal is that it talks a lot about accountability but does not embody it.” (80)

“We are constantly being sold the fear curriculum so that, in time, we begin to think the context of fear is for good cause and data based… the dominant fear conversation is as much a result of marketing and product promotion as it is a response to facts” (81)

“One payoff for believing that the problems and the suffering in our cities are the inevitably products of modern life and culture is that it lets us off the hook” (82)

“Projection denies the fact that my view of the ‘other’ is my creation, and this is especially true with how we view our communities and the people in them” (83)

“It is not that the people we project onto do not have some of the qualities we see; it is that the meaning we give to what we see — in this case, the label and categorization — is just projection.” (83)

“When we believe that the ‘other’ is the problem and that transformation is required of them and not of us, we become the beneficiaries of their suffering in the world. Some of us make a living off their deficiencies.” (84)

“In our philanthropy, this mindset that the ‘other’ is the problem means that we need to wait for them to change before the change we want in the world can come to pass…. If we saw others as another aspect of ourselves, we would welcome them into our midst.” (84)

“When we stay isolated, there is no way to take back the communal projection…. Projection sustains itself in the absence of relatedness, in places where we have no sense of belonging…. Communal transformation, taking back our communal projections, occurs when people get connected to those who were previously strangers, and when we invite people into conversations that ask them to act as creators or owners of community.” (86)

### Chapter 6: What It Means to Be a Citizen

“a citizen is one who is willing to be accountable for and committed to the well-being of the whole” (89)

“The antithesis of being a citizen is the choice to be a consumer or a client…. Consumers give power away. They believe that their own needs can best be satisfied by the actions of thers…. Consumers also allow others to define their needs.” (89-90)

“The step from thinking of ourselves as effect to thinking of ourselves as cause is the act of inversion that creates a culture of citizen accountability.” (93)

“I will be accountable for only that which I have had a hand in creating, my life and community included.” (97)

“The weakness in the dominant view of accountability is that it thinks people can be _held_ accountable. That we can force people to be accountable…. This illusion is what creates entitlement — and worse, it drives us apart; it does not bring us together.” (99)

### Chapter 7: The Transforming Community

“A shift in community benefits from shifts in individual consciousness but needs a communal connectedness as well, a communal structure of belonging that produces the foundation for the whole system to move.” (102)

“The role of leaders is not to be better role models or to drive change; their role is to create the structures and experiences that bring citizens together to identify and solve their own issues.” (103)

“it is in those moments when citizens engage one another, in communion and the witness of others, that something collective shifts” (103)

“The primary questions for community transformation are ‘How do we choose to be together?’ and ‘What do we want to create together?’” (104)

“Belonging requires the courage to set aside our usual notions of action and measuring success by the numbers touched. It also means that while we keep our own point of view, we leave our self-interest at the door and show up to learn rather than to advocate.” (104)

“Our typical way of creating a future is by specifying the vision, the goals, and then defining a blueprint to achieve it. This is called a destination strategy for solving problems.” (105)

“We still believe that in building a community, we are in effect building and operating a clock.” (107)

“While visions, plans, and committed top leadership are important, even essential, no clear vision, nor detailed plan, nor committed group leaders have the power to bring this image of the future into existence without the continued engagement and involvement of citizens.” (108)

“the challenge for every community is not so much to have a vision of what it wants to become, or a plan, or specific timetables. The real challenge is to discover and create the means for engaging citizens that brings a new possibility into being.” (108)

## Part Two: The Alchemy of Belonging

“Up to this point, we have said that transformation occurs when we shift context and value possibility, and this grows from a sense of belonging. We can now be specific about the means for making this happen.” (113)

### Chapter 8: Leadership is Convening

“Communal transformation requires a certain kind of leadership, one that creates conditions where context shifts:
- From a place of fear and fault to one of gifts, generosity, and abundance
- From a belief in more laws and oversight to a belief in social fabric and chosen accountability
- From the corporation and systems as central, to associational life as central
- From a focus on leaders to a focus on citizens
- From problems to possibility
For this shift in context to occur, we need leadership that supports a restorative path.” (115)

“In communal transformation, leadership is about intention, convening, valuing relatedness, and presenting choices.” (115)

“The search for great leadership is a prime example of how we too often take something that does not work and try harder at it.” (116)

“the core task of leaders is to create the conditions for civic or institutional engagement. They do this through the power they have to name the debate and design gatherings” (116)

“Leadership begins with understanding that every gathering is an opportunity to deepend accountability and commitment through engagement. It doesn’t matter what the stated purpose of the gathering is.” (117)

“Listening may be the single most powerful action the leader can take. Leaders will always be under pressure to speak, but if building social fabric is important, and sustained transformation is the goal, then listening becomes the greater service.” (119)

“The customer model, in which elected officials exist to satisfy citizen demands, is a disservice to community, even though citizens love it. Elected officials are partners with citizens, not suppliers. The most useful role that elected officials can perform is to bring citizens together.” (122)

### Chapter 9: The Small Group Is the Unit of Transformation

“Small groups have the most leverage when they meet as part of a larger gathering. At these moments, citizens experience the intimacy of the small circle and are simultaneously aware that they are part of a larger whole that shares their concerns.” (125)

“We have conversations where the focus is on the communal possibility and there is a shift of ownership of this place, even though others are in charge. We structure these conversations so that diversity of thinking and dissent are given space, commitments are made without barter, and the gifts of each person and our community are acknowledged and valued.” (125)

“One conventional structure for meeting is described in _Robert’s Rules of Order_. It is good at efficiency and containing conflict; it is also good at dampening energy…. For community building, we want to give as much or more attention to that which creates energy as we give to the content, which usually exhausts energy.” (126)

“The small group also offers a self-correcting quality when things are not going well. There are always times in any gathering when we become stuck. Energy is low, perhaps there is anger or cynicism in the room, or simply confusion, and we are unsure what to do. The best path in nearly every situation is to put our faith in citizens to identify and name what is occurring. Simply request people to form small groups of three or four and ask them to discuss what is going on and report back in ten minutes.” (128)

“every large group meeting needs to use small groups to create connection and move the action forward” (128)

### Chapter 10: Questions Are More Transforming Than Answers

“How we frame the questions is decisive. They need to be ambiguous, personal, and stressful. The way we introduce the questions also matters. We name the distinction the question addresses by stating what is different and unique about this conversation. We give permission for unpopular answers, and inoculate people against advice and help. Advice is replaced by curiosity.” (133)

“_The conversation is not so much about the future for the community, but is the future itself._” (134); parallel to yoga practice, in which the point is the practice itself, not the future benefits that it might provide

“Powerful questions are those that, in the answering, evoke a choice for accountability and commitment. They are questions that take us to requests, offers, declarations, forgiveness, confession, gratitude, and welcome, all of which are memorable and have a transformative power.” (136)

on the usual kinds of questions we ask: “The hidden agenda in these questions is to maintain dominance and to be right. They urge us to raise standards, measure more closely, and return to basics, purportedly to create accountability. They are not really about returning to basics, they are about returning to what got us here. These questions have no power; they only carry force.” (138)

“Powerful questions are the ones that cause you to become an actor as soon as you answer them.” (139)

“A great question has three qualities: // It is ambiguous…. It is personal…. It evokes anxiety.” (139-40)

Four elements to setting up the conversation: “Name the distinctions. Give permission for unpopular answers. Avoid advice and replace it with curiosity. Precisely name the question.” (141)

on naming the distinctions: “How valuable an experience do you _plan_ to have in this event?” (142); “To ask what kind of experience we _plan_ to have places the ownership of that experience clearly in our hands. The language of what we plan requires us to be accountable.” (142)

“When people are asked a question, they are conditioned to seek the right answer to feel good, or to fit in for the sake of belonging. Encourage them to answer honestly, by naming possible unpopular answers and supporting their expression.” (143)

“We need to tell people not to be helpful. Trying to be helpful and giving advice are really ways to control others…. In community building, we want to substitute curiosity for advice.” (143)

## Midterm Review

“Here are conversations that produce something more than just talk:
- Invitation
- Possibility
- Ownership
- Dissent
- Commitment
- Gifts” (147)

### Chapter 11: Invitation

“the six elements of a powerful invitation: naming the possibility about which we are convening, being clear about whom we invite, emphasizing freedom of choice in showing up, specifying what is required of each should they choose to attend, making a clear request, and making the invitation as personal as possible.” (149)

“In an authentic community, citizens decide anew every single time whether to show up.” (151)

“The anxiety of invitation is that if we give them a choice, they might not show up.” (151)

“The patriarchal fear is that without restraints, incentives, and the use of acceptable force, nothing will get done.” (152)

“Genuine invitation changes our relationship with others, for we come to them as an equal. I must be willing to take no for an answer” (153)

“Barter or coercion seems necessary when we have little faith in citizens’ desire and capacity to operate out of idealism.” (154)

“the invitation is a request not only to show up but to engage. It declares, ‘We want you to come, but if you do, something will be required from you.’” (155)

“We have to let go of our story about the past. This means you keep inviting those who have not been in the conversation. Even if people say no, that act itself is important and counts for something.” (156)

“Eventually those who do show up always have the task of decision whom to invite next.” (156)

“We choose to have faith that there are good reasons for others not attending what is important to us. Let them know that even if they say no now, they will always be welcome in the future.” (158)

### Chapter 12: The Possibility, Ownership, Dissent, Commitment, and Gifts Conversations

Conversation Two: Possibility
- “The challenge with possibility is it gets confused with goals, prediction, and optimism…. Goals, prediction, and optimism don’t create anything; they just might make things a little better and cheer us up in the process…. Possibility creates something new. It is a declaration of a future that has the quality of being and aliveness that we choose to live into.” (163)
- Questions: 
	- “What is the crossroads where you find yourself at this stage of your life or work or in the project around which we are assembled?” (165)
	- “What declaration of possibility can you make that has the power to transform the community and inspire you?” (165)

Conversation Three: Ownership
- “A subtle denial of ownership is innocence and indifference. The future is denied with the response, ‘It doesn’t matter to me — whatever you want to do is fine.’” (167)
- “The key distinction for the conversation is between ownership and blame (a form of entitlement).” (167)
- Early questions:
	- (on a scale of 1 to 7) “How valuable an experience (or project, or community) do you plan for this to be?” (168)
	- “How much risk are you willing to take?” (169)
	- “How participative do you plan to be?” (169)
	- “To what extent are you invested in the well-being of the whole?” (169)
- Other questions:
	- on guilt: “What have I done to contribute to the very thing I complain about or want to change?” (169)
	- on story: “What is the story about this community or organization that you hear yourself most often telling?… What are the payoffs you receive from holding onto this story?… What is your attachment to this story costing you?” (170)

Conversation Four: Dissent
- “Inviting dissent into the conversation is how we show respect for a wide range of beliefs.” (171)
- “A critical task of leadership is to protect space for the expression of people’s doubts. The act of surfacing doubts and dissent does not deflect the communal intention to create something new… leaders do not have to respond to each person’s doubts. None of us do…. When we think we have to answer people’s doubts and defend ourselves, then the space for dissent closes down.” (171)
- “Listening is the action step that replaces defending ourselves. Listening, understanding at a deeper level than is being expressed, is the action that creates a restorative community.” (172)
- “‘No’ is the beginning of the conversation for commitment. This is critical: that dissent is followed by the other conversations.” (173)
- “The fear is that we will make people more negative by making room for refusal…. We will let go of only those doubts that we have given voice to.” (173)
- “There is a vital difference between authentic dissent and inauthentic dissent, which we can call false refusal…. Denial means we act as if the present is good enough…. Rebellion is more complex. It lives in reaction to the world…. Resignation is the ultimate act of powerlessness and a stance against possibility. It is a passive form of control. It is born of our cynicism and loss of faith.” (174-76)
- Questions:
	- “What doubts and reservations do you have?
	- What is the no, or refusal, that you keep postponing?
	- What have you said yes to, that you no longer really mean?
	- What is a commitment or decision that you have changed your mind about?” (177)

Conversation Five: Commitment
- “Commitment is a promise made with no expectation of return. It is the willingness to make a promise independent of either approval or reciprocity from other people…. A bargained future is not an alternative future; it is more of the past brought forward.” (178)
- “Nothing kills democracy or transformation faster than lip service.” (178)
- “We can move forward with refusal; we cannot move forward with maybe.” (179)
- Questions:
	- “What promises am I willing to make?
	- What measures have meaning to me?
	- What price am I willing to pay?
	- What is the cost to others for me to keep my commitments, or to fail in my commitments?
	- What is the promise I’m willing to make that constitutes a risk or major shift for me?
	- What is the promise I am postponing?
	- What is the promise or commitment I am unwilling to make?” (180-81)

Conversation Six: Gifts
- “The focus on gifts confronts people with their essential core, that which has the potential to make the difference and change lives for the good.” (182)
- “The gifts conversation boils down to our willingness to stop telling people about
	- what they need to improve
	- what didn’t go well
	- how they should do it differently next time” (183)
- Questions:
	- “What gift have you received from another in this room?” (184)
	- “What has someone in your small group done today that has touched you or moved you or been of value to you?” (184)
	- “In what way did a particular person engage you in a way that had meaning?” (184)
	- “What is the gift you currently hold in exile?
	- What is it about you that no one knows about?
	- What are you grateful for that has gone unspoken?
	- What is the positive feedback you receive that still surprises you?
	- What is the gift you have that you do not fully acknowledge?” (186)

### Chapter 13: Bringing Hospitality into the World

“Greet people at the door; welcome them personally and help them get seated. People enter in isolation. Reduce the isolation they came with; let them know they came to the right place and are not alone.” (189)

“After the welcome, begin with a statement of why you are there. Declare the possibility that led to the invitation.” (190)

early on, create connection (not icebreakers; questions about why & how attendees are present)

acknowledge late arrivals and early departures; have healthy food

### Chapter 14: Designing Physical Space That Supports Community

“Every room we occupy serves as a metaphor for the larger community that we want to create. This is true socially and physically…. If the future does not exist in this room, today, then it will never occur tomorrow. This is what is meant by ‘Change the room, change the culture.’” (196)

effects of design of traditional spaces: conference rooms, auditoriums, classrooms, reception areas, hallways, cafeterias

“Alienated and retributive cultures will create alienated and unfriendly buildings and public spaces. Patriarchal institutions will create physical space that glorifies those who lead them and the designers they choose, and they will be indifferent, in the name of cost, to the space dedicated to workers and citizens.” (205)

### Chapter 15: The End of Unnecessary Suffering

“Human suffering is the pain that is inherent in being alive: isolation, loneliness, illness, abandonment, loss of meaning, sadness, and finally (I think) death. These are unavoidable; they are going to happen to each of us, and try as we may, there is nothing we can do to prevent them.” (211-12)

“The other kind of pain is political suffering. This is avoidable and unnecessary suffering…. I am calling this political suffering because I believe it grows out of human choice.” (212)

“The political suffering will decrease as we collectively choose to be together in a way that creates a space for something new to occur. What is needed is for us to choose over and over to more widely distribute ownership and accountability.” (213)
