Davidson, Cathy. “Towards a History of Books and Readers.” American Quarterly 40.1 (March 1988): 7-17.


"A book exists, simultaneously, as a physical object, a sign system, the end product of diverse arts and labors, and the starting point for intercultural and intracultural communication. To understand what books are and do in the societies that create them (societies that are, in turn, influenced by books) requires the most dextrous kind of scholarship -- scholarship firmly rooted in the details of book morphology and printing history (the usual terrain of the textual scholar and the analytical bibliographer) but scholarship innovative enough to raise speculative questions about the private and communal interactions between texts and readers (the territory of the intellectual historian and the literary theorist)." (Davidson 7)

"one concern of book historians has been the relationship between the dissemination of books and the larger institutional structures of a society. It should be noted that book historians, too, work within such structures, and, in America, at least some of the inspiration for the present interest in book history must be attributed to the establishment of two important centers for book research in the U.S. In 1979 the Library of Congress established its Center for the Book as both a locus for scholarly activity (hosting conferences as well as publishing numerous books and pamphlets on subjects ranging from copyright law to the history of literacy) and a public outreach program which, in the words of Daniel Boorstin, is designed 'to organize, focus, and dramatize our nation's interest and attention on the book, to marshal the nation's support -- spiritual, physical, and fiscal -- for the book.'" (Davidson 9, quoting Boorstin, quoted in Carter[!])

"Just who could, in fact, read at any particular time is one of the most basic questions in any study of the influence of printing and it is one of the most difficult to answer. The illiterate rarely leave historical traces nor can contemporaneous assessments of literacy be entirely trusted. John Adams, for example, liked to boast that 'a native American who cannot read and write is as rare as a comet or an earthquake.' Yet slaves in John Adams' America were explicitly forbidden literacy and even Abigail Adams complained about the lamentable state of women's literacy levels in her era. Moreover, literacy itself is never a simple 'rate' but embodies an ideology, a philosophy of education, of who should be educated, at what public cost, and to what end." (Davidson 10)

"Who could read merges into the question of who did read, which itself merges into the inescapable economic questions of who could afford access to books, what forms that access took, and what meaning that access had in individual lives and communities." (Davidson 11)

"German historian Rolf Engelsing, who coined the term 'Leserrevolution,' has argued that the reading process itself -- as individual action and community interaction -- changed as a result of the new availability of books. In an earlier more restricted print world, Engelsing maintains, readers read 'intensively,' rereading over the course of a lifetime the same few precious books and incorporating those books into life's most intimate and portentous activities (as seen, totemically, in the action of recording births, christenings, marriages, and deaths on the end leaves of the family Bible). By contrast, in the modern world of mass production, readers read 'extensively,' rapidly consuming more and more books while placing increasingly less significance on the books they read. There is a moral and social implication embedded in Engelsing's vivid description of postindustrial reading. More is definitely less; books dwindle to commodities; formerly engaged readers become passive consumers." (Davidson 12)

"within one society (pre- or postindustrial) there can exist many different and often overlapping reading communities and many kinds of readers. An individual can participate in more than one reading community and can have different reading strategies and purposes in different situations (the professional paleographer, for example, might also be a detective mystery addict or a closet reader of Harlequin romances -- an extreme but perhaps not inapplicable example for readers of this journal)." (Davidson 12)

"As Janice A. Radway has argued persuasively, the consumption metaphor of reading is a false one because it reduces a complex interaction between a reader and a text to a simple, passive process of "ingestion." As Radway observes, 'by focusing on social process -- that is, on what people do with texts and objects rather than on those texts and objects themselves -- we should begin to see that people do not ingest mass culture whole but often remake it into something they can use.'" (Davidson 12, quoting Radway, "Reading Is Not Eating")

"Zboray shows how the same technologies that could make more books available than ever before to some Americans also displaced another class of readers -- primarily the artisans in the older printing shop. His essay explores the relationships between the technological aspects of book production (printing, publishing) and the life of the mind, but also shows that technological innovation can have a dramatically different impact on different social groups or classes or in different regions of the nation." (Davidson 13, referring to Ronald Zboray, "Antebellum Reading and the Ironies of Technological Innovation")

"When a prosperous and largely literate nation tolerates and even promotes pockets of both poverty and illiteracy, the history of the book must also address the political, social, and moral implications of that denial, both for those who perpetrated it and for those who endured it." (Davidson 14)

"Books cannot be understood apart from the society that creates them, and, conversely, no literate society can be understood without some study of the books it produces. At least since Gutenberg, 'books' and 'history' have been inseparably intertwined. Although relatively new as a distinct field of study, the history of the book explores that long-standing double complicity." (Davidson 15)
