# Austin, J.L.  *How to Do Things with Words*.  Cambridge, MA:  Harvard University Press:  1962.


## Lecture I

mistaken assumption of philosophers that "statements" are only descriptive or factual; grammarians understand that not all "sentences" are "statements"

Kant:  many statements are nonsense, though grammatically correct

others, however, masquerade as statements

"To overlook these possibilities in the way once common is called the 'descriptive' fallacy; but perhaps this is not a good name, as 'descriptive' itself is special.  Not all true or false statements are descriptions, and for this reason I prefer to use the word 'Constative'" (Austin 3).

Performative utterances:  "A.  they do not 'describe' or 'report' or constate anything at all, are not 'true or false'; and / B.  the uttering of the sentence is, or is a part of, the doing of an action, which again would not normally be described as saying something" (Austin 5).

"The uttering of the words is, indeed, usually a, or even the, leading incident in the performance of the act (of betting or whatnot), the performance of which is also the object of the utterance, but it is far from being usually, even if it is ever, the sole thing necessary if the act is to be deemed to have been performed.  Speaking generally, it is always necessary that the circumstances in which the words are uttered should be in some way, or ways, appropriate, and it is very commonly necessary that either the speaker himself or other persons should also perform certain other actions, whether 'physical' or 'mental' actions or even acts of uttering further words" (Austin 8).

performatives are not "true" or "false," but performed in good or bad faith, successful or unsuccessful

## Lecture II

"It is worth of note that, as I am told, in the American law of evidence, a report of what someone else said is admitted as evidence if what he said is an utterance of our performative kind:  because this is regarded as a report not so much of something he said, as which it would be hear-say and not admissible as evidence, but rather as something he did, an action of his" (Austin 13).

things that can go wrong with performatives:  "the doctrine of the Infelicities" (Austin 14)

misfires v. abuses -- in misfires, the performative fails; in abuses, it succeeds, but is taken in bad faith

misfires may be divided into misinvocations, misapplications, misexecutions

"the more we consider a statement not as a sentence (or proposition) but as an act of speech (out of which the others are logical constructions) the more we are studying the whole thing as an act" (Austin 20).

various infelicities not exhaustive or mutually exclusive

## Lecture III

examples of various infelicities

is it necessary for the person being ordered to do something to agree with the order?  "This is, of course, one of the uncertainties -- and a purely general one really -- which underlie the debate when we discuss in political theory whether there is or is not or should be a social contract" (Austin 29).

implicit or "primitive" performatives in addition to explicit ones

## Lecture IV

other infelicities -- insincerities, lies

three (of many) ways that the truth of a statement implies the truth of other statements:  entails, implies, presupposes

entails:  if p entails q, then \~q entails \~p; implies: contradiction suggests insincerity; presupposes:  contradiction is meaningless -- like performative infelicities

"in order to explain what can go wrong with statements we cannot just concentrate on the proposition involved (whatever that is) as has been done traditionally.  We must consider the total situation in which the utterance is issued -- the total speech-act -- if we are to see the parallel between statements and performative utterances, and how each can go wrong.  Perhaps indeed there is no great distinction between statements and performative utterances" (Austin 52).

## Lecture V

is there some grammatical way to absolutely distinguish the performative from the constative?  or is it a question of vocabulary?

"We said that the idea of a performative utterance was that it was to be (or to be included as part of) the performance of an action.  Actions can only be performed by persons, and obviously in our cases the utterer must be the performer:  hence our justifiable feeling -- which we wrongly cast into purely grammatical mould -- in favor of the 'first person', who must come in, being mentioned or referred to; moreover, if the utterer is acting, he must be doing something -- hence our perhaps ill-expressed favouring of the grammatical present and grammatical active of the verb.  There is something which is at the moment of uttering being done by the person uttering" (Austin 60). -- and yet -- two of the non-first person examples he gives are signs; there, the signs and their readers produce the utterance, not the utterer... (claims such examples are "reducible" to the first person)

## Lecture VI

distinction between "explicit performative" and "primary performative"; "I promise that I shall be there" versus "I shall be there."

the explicit performative as a later development of language than the primary?

"sophistication and development of social forms and procedures will necessitate clarification" (Austin 72)

can all performatives be put into the explicit?

## Lecture VII

but even apparently explicit performatives often aren't purely performative

behabitives:  "a kind of performative connected roughly with reactions to behavior and with behavior toward others and designed to exhibit attitudes and feelings" (Austin 83)

expositives:  "expositional performatives.  Here the main body of the utterance has generally or often the straight-forward form of a 'statement,' but there is an explicit performative verb at its head which shows how the 'statement' is to be fitted into the context of conversation, interlocution, dialogue, or in general of exposition" (Austin 85).

verdictives:  "if you are a judge and say 'I hold that..."' then to say you hold is to hold; with less official persons it is not so clearly so:  it may be merely descriptive of a state of mind" (Austin 88).

clarification of what it is to "issue an utterance"; in the linguistic sense, to say anything is always to do something

## Lecture VIII

saying anything is "the performance of a locutionary act" (Austin 94)

phonetic act (uttering certain noises); phatic act (uttering certain vocables or words, belonging to a vocabulary and a grammar); rhetic act (uttering vocables with sense and reference)

"He said 'The cat is on the mat'" reports a phatic act; "He said that the cat is on the mat" reports a rhetic act (indirect speech)

one can perform a phonetic act that is not a phatic act, but not vice versa; one can perform a phatic act that is not a rhetic act, but not vice versa

"To perform a locutionary act is in general, we may say, also and eo ipso to perform an illocutionary act, as I propose to call it" (Austin 98)

illocutionary act:  "performance of an act in saying something as opposed to performance of an act of saying something" (Austin 99)

perlocutionary act:  speech acts that have consequences that are not direct effects

## Lecture IX

distinguishing between illocutionary and perlocutionary acts

exploration of consequences and causality

## Lecture X

generally, in illocutionary acts, one does something in saying something; in perlocutionary acts, one does something by saying something

## Lecture XI

are "statements" prone to the same kind of infelicities as performatives?  If so, is every speech act a performative?

"The truth or falsity of a statement depends not merely on the meanings of the words but on what act you were performing in what circumstances" (Austin 144).

constatives and performatives as poles on a spectrum of speech acts?

or perhaps a historical development?

## Lecture XII

need to consider "the total speech act in the total speech situation" (Austin 147)

attempt to list the illocutionary forces of an utterance

five general classes of speech acts:  verdictives, exercitives, commissives, behabitives, expositives

verdictives are the giving of a verdict or judgement; exercitives are the exercising of powers; commissives are promising or otherwise committing to something; behabitives involve attitudes and social behavior; expositives clarify how our utterances fit into a conversation or argument

many overlaps and connections among classes
