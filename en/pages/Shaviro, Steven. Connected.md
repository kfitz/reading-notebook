Shaviro, Steven.  Connected:  Or What It Means to Live in the Network Society.  Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2003.

Preface

Haraway:  "the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion" (qtd on Shaviro ix)

world being transformed into science fiction, "or at least into a virtual-reality game" (Shaviro ix)

mode of book is to "try to write cultural theory as science fiction to come to grips with a world that itself seems on the verge of being absorbed into the play of science fiction novels and films" (Shaviro ix)

"Philosophy is like science fiction in that it deals with concepts that have not yet been worked out" (Shaviro ix)

"In a different way, Carl Freedman argues, in his book _Critical Theory and Science Fiction_, that 'theory' and 'science fiction' have a privileged relationship.  Both of these sorts of writing seek to grasp the social world not by representing it mimetically but be performing a kind of 'cognitive estrangement' upon it (a term that Freedman borrows from Darko Suvin), so that the structures and assumptions that we take for granted, and that undergird our own social reality, may be seen in their full contingency and historicity.  This means that science fiction is the privileged genre (literary, cinematic, televisual, and digital) for contemporary critical theory, in much the same way that the nineteenth-century realist novel was the privileged genre for the early twentieth-century Marxist criticsm of Georg Lukács and others." (Shaviro x)

term "network society" drawn from Manuel Castells

book is "not an empirical study but a speculative exercise in cultural theory" (Shaviro x)

"Science fiction is always written in the future tense -- conceptually, if not grammatically.  Not only is it about what has not yet happened, but its very structure is that of the not-yet-happened.  It addresses events in their potentiality, which is something vaster and more mysterious -- more perturbingly *other
-- than any actual outcome could ever be....  In this way, science fiction conjures the invisible forces -- technological, social, economic, affective, and political -- that surround us.  It makes those forces visible and palpable, and brings us face to face with them, however frightening and untoward they may be.  It is only by writing cultural theory as science fiction that I can hope for my work to be (in Lenin's famous phrase) 'as radical as reality itself.'" (Shaviro xi)

Connected

Only Connect:  "Every connection has its price; the one thing you can be sure of is that, sooner or later, you will have to pay." (Shaviro 3); what do we really want out of all this connection?

Song of the Jungle:  everything today looks like a network; network as "almost too perfect a metaphor" (Shaviro 4); Kevin Kelly and corporate 'hive mind'; economic implications; "Such is the soft fascism of the corporate network: it reconciles the conflicting imperatives of aggressive predation on the one hand, and unquestioning obedience and conformity on the other." (Shaviro 4)

Stop the World, I Want to Get Off:  "you will never get television out of your life simply by turning it off and throwing away your set.  It will follow you anyway, because the entire world exists only in order to be televised" (Shaviro 4); "You cannot opt out of the network entirely, but at the very least, you can try to be connected a little less.  You can provide your own negative feedback.  You can regulate your own contributions to the system that is regulating you." (Shaviro 5)

Medium Cool:  McLuhan on TV; TV doesn't brainwash us; "Much more subtly and insidiously, TV draws us into discourse, absorbs us into the network.... We may say of television what Foucault says more generally about postmodern power:  it doesn't constrain us or repress us, so much as 'it incited, it induces, it seduces.'" (Shaviro 6)

The Body and the Screen:  "The Internet is even cooler than television" (Shaviro 6); posture requirement; "the hand becomes an extension of the eye: I reach right into the screen and travel through its iconic, hyperlinked space" (Shaviro 7); space on net as "haptic"; times as flexible; fragmentation and multiplication of attention

Distraction:  Bruce Sterling novel, /Distraction/; character's dual attention (referred to here, apparently unironically, as "double consciousness"?)

Come to Daddy:  video for "Come to Daddy" by Aphex Twin; horror

The Integrated Circuit:  cybernetic theory; network as "self-generating, self-organizing, self-sustaining system" that "works through multiple feedback loops" (Shaviro 10); "What seems like noise, waste, chance, or mere redundancy from the point of view of any given system turns out to be meaningful and functional in the context of the next, higher-level system" (Shaviro 10)

The Algebra of Need:  Burroughs, /Naked Lunch/; algebra of need underwrites consumer culture:  "Total need guarantees total participation; and total participation means total subjection" (Shaviro 11); connection to networks:  "the logic of networks tends toward the algebra of need because the addiction process is facilitated and accelerated when materiality is replaced by information" (Shaviro 11); information has no cost for the supplier, but demand is infinite

Fractals and Viruses:  network as shaped like fractal; reversal of McLuhan on network as extension of CNS:  "every individual brain is a miniaturized replica of the global communications network" (Shaviro 12); Deleuze on subjectivity as a fold:  " it is 'an interiorization of the outside... a redoubling of the Other... a repetition of the Different... It resembles exactly the invagination of a tissue in embryology'" (Shaviro 12); "The crucial point is that the network induces mass replication on a miniaturized scale and that I myself am only an effect of this miniaturizing process" (Shaviro 13)

Viral Marketing:  "The idea is to send out an advertisement that 'spreads like a disease'.... This is supposed to be more than just a metaphor.  The viral message is composed of memes in the same way that a biological virus is composed of genes." (Shaviro 13); "It's even better than having a slave who works for free: the customer actually pays for the opportunity to be your shill.  This sort of viral infection, and interiorization, is the final step in the algebra of need: now the entire network is miniaturized and implanted directly into the brain of every individual consumer" (Shaviro 14)

The Selfish Meme:  Dawkins' theory of natural selection of genes; if genes/memes engage in struggle for survival, then there is "an almost Manichean duality... an irreducible gap between replicator and vehicle, between genotype and phenotype... in short, between the ideality of a repeating informational pattern, and the contingency of any particular material embodiment." (Shaviro 15)

A Universal History of Parasitism:  "Genes and memes are helpless without their hosts.  They need to be instantiated in flesh, or at least in matter....  We cannot think of information as just a pattern imprinted indifferently in one or another physical medium.  For information is also an event.  It isn't just the content of a given message but all the things that happen when the message gets transmitted." (Shaviro 16); "The individual organism is only a transitory by-product of the multiple processes running through this network." (Shaviro 16)

Bloodchild:  Octavia Butler, "Bloodchild"; "ambivalent relations between a parasite and its host" (Shaviro 17)

My Vocabulary Did This to Me:  Jack Spicer on poetry as parasite; "The poem is written in the poet's own language; it is made out of his or her own memories, ideas, desires, and obsessions.  But the message composed with these material is not anything the poet wants to say." (Shaviro 18)

Language Is a Virus:  Beat poet Lew Welch, writer of Raid slogan

Everything Is True, Everything Is Permitted:  Burroughs, Cities of the Red Night

Possible Worlds:  Ken MacLeod, "Fall Revolution" series; "The network is never neutral and never merely technical.  Rather, it is political to the core.  Its development is largely driven by economic and ideological forces.  It is both a weapon and a stake in ongoing political struggles." (Shaviro 21); "market-crazed society"

Media Saturation:  comic book series /Transmetropolitan/; "the delirium of advanced technology has been entirely woven into the texture of everyday life.  This is what a fully networked, 'posthuman' existence might be like.  Could we really endure such a condition?" (Shaviro 23)

The Message Is the Medium:  swarms of email messages, "blurbflies"; the "insect pests" of the media ecology (Shaviro 24); "Foucault argued that there is no such thing as Language; there is only a multitude of particular statements, each of which is more an action than a signification.  The accumulation of these statements over time leaves behind traces and contours that we retrospectively construe as 'regularities of discourse.'  Similarly, the network is not a disembodied information pattern nor a system of frictionless pathways over which any message whatsoever can be neutrally conveyed.  Rather, the force of all the messages, as they accrete over time, determines the very shape of the network." (Shaviro 24)

Buy Me:  /Transmetropolitan/'s "buybombs," ads that invade dreams; "The really important thing about dreaming is this:  it is the most antisocial activity I ever engage in." (Shaviro 25); "My dreams are so many proofs of my singularity; they cannot be redeemed, or substituted for, or exchanged." (Shaviro 25)

Arms Race:  people's resistance to and avoidance of ads met with newer more insidious techniques, leading to an arms race between advertisers and consumers;  "In the age of cinematic, mechanical reproduction, filmmakers were always upping the anti, in terms of the shocks with which they assaulted the audience.  In turn, audiences responded to these shocks by becoming habituated to them and by cultivating an ever greater sense of distraction.... In our current, cooler and more intimate, media atmosphere, the process is more one of insinuation than of shock:  the ads irritate me like an itch on an intimate body part that I am unable to scratch." (Shaviro 27)

Rumble in the Bronx:  hip-hop album, Infesticons v. Majesticons

Monadology:  "What does it mean to be a node in the network?" (Shaviro 28); we are Leibnizian monads, "simultaneously connected and alone" (Shaviro 29)

Are You Experienced?:  the Experience Music Project, in which visitors are totally wired in and behave totally as monads

From Surveillance to Control:  "In a totally networked world, where every point communicates directly with every other point, power is no longer faceless and invisible.  Instead, it works in plain sight.  Its smiley face is always there to greet us." (Shaviro 31);  "No more need for classified FBI files and secret police reports; discreetly and intimately, the network takes care of everything." (Shaviro 32)

The Politics of Confinement:  Foucault, panopticon, and disciplinary documentation

The Politics of Performance:  "The network does not need any sort of a priori transcendental regulation.  Instead, it is immanently self-organizing" (Shaviro 33); "Surveillance records are no longer about anyone or anything.  They are performative instead of constative; it is not what they say that matters, but what they do" (Shaviro 34)

More Stately Mansions:  "it's not that Bill Gates is scheming to oppress us; it's just that our oppression and subjugation is an unavoidable consequence of his own self-glorification" (Shaviro 35)

Video on Demand:  "The purpose of video surveillance is not to record crimes and other dangerous events so much as to prevent these events from happening in the first place" (Shaviro 36)

Street Theater:  Surveillance Camera Players (SCP); "By giving the surveillance apparatus something to look at, they contaminate and parasitize the network" (Shaviro 38)

No Privacy:  "the very techniques that were initially used to protect privacy are now being used as weapons against it" (Shaviro 38); "Encryption and digital watermarking are indeed quite useful, if you want to protect monopolistic property rights.  But that is not the same as privacy" (Shaviro 39)

Transparency:  "It is futile to try to protect privacy by encrypting personal data or by otherwise placing limits on the flow of information, for the network tears down all barriers in its path" (Shaviro 39); calls for "reciprocal transparency" as only protection for the vulnerable in the network

Irrational Exuberance:  Castells, the market no longer bears any relationship to reality; "Stocks do not represent values that exist in the real world; rather, financial speculation itself is what generates all those real-world values in the first place" (Shaviro 41)

Zeroes and Ones:  'information wants to be free' is a naive formulation; "the greater the amount of information that is gathered, the more correlations and cross-references it potentially contains; and consequently, the more each new bit of information is worth" (Shaviro 42); court rulings over sampling; "Such stringent restrictions might seem to contradict the extravagant promise of digital technology.  But in fact, they follow quite logically from it.  For the massive accumulation of digital data is also an act of appropriation.  Turning the heterogeneous contents of the world into zeroes and ones, uniform bits of information, is a way of claiming ownership of those contents." (Shaviro 43); the tragedy of the commons

Codes for the Cataclysm:  /Deltron 3030/, science fiction concept hip-hop album; "What really makes a difference is the distribution of information rather than its mere quantity: power consists in controlling access to the best databases, and extracting payment for their use" (Shaviro 44)

Rhythm Warfare:  hip-hop as "an art of recombination.... Hip-hop is a kind of linguistic and cultural hacking.  Its experiments are, at one and the same time, interventions in digital code, and analog movements in and through physical space" (Shaviro 45)

Not a Bang, but a Whimper:  censorship doesn't work well in the age of the network; "A subtler method of information control is therefore needed, one that goes along with digital technology, instead of making futile attempts to block it.  That is why the future lies with Digital Rights Management:  encryption and registration schemes, and proprietary standards.  Information itself is the best tool for regulating information" (Shaviro 46); the point is to "channel and direct" the flow of information "by embedding surveillance and control mechanisms within it" (Shaviro 46)

From Statute to Contract:  "The American entertainment industry is well on its way to obtaining a more thorough control over speech and expression than Stalin or Ceausescu ever dreamed of" (Shaviro 47); "It is no longer possible to make the old distinction between ideas (which cannot be copyrighted) and specific expressions of those ideas (which can).  Everything is code, or specific expression" (Shaviro 47)

Oxygen:  is information like air?  should it be treated like a natural resource, or regulated by the market?

Your Money or Your Life:  Singapore and restricted speech via libel suits

Corporate Free Speech:  Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other forms of "the drive to define the content of speech as private property" (Shaviro 50);  "Spending one's own money is thus enshrined as the purest form of expression.  And any speech not backed up by money is precisely worthless" (Shaviro 51)

The Real Meaning of Intellectual Property (I):  Columbia Records's use of anti-establishment ad slogan

The Real Meaning of Intellectual Property (II):  Beyonce Knowles's hopes "to do more product endorsements" (Shaviro 51)

Sic Semper Tyrannis:  the death penalty for copyright violators?  or Barlow's utopian desire to get rid of intellectual property law and give all digital content away free

Better Off Dead:  in Jeter's /Noir/, information pirates are condemned to "a lingering life-in-death" (Shaviro 54)

Pirate Utopia:  the heyday of Napster; "In such a climate, I came to believe that sharing files with strangers was a virtuous act; even more, that circumventing copyright law was a high moral imperative" (Shaviro 56)

The Bottom Line:  so Jeter has a point (!); "Anything less ruthless and violent is unlikely to work" (Shaviro 57)

A General Theory of Evil:  Jeter, copyright violation driven by hatred of the artist?  "To love a work of art is to be consumed with rage against that work's creator" (Shaviro 58); see Bloom, /The Anxiety of Influence/

The Pleasure of the Text:  Roland Barthes, the death of the author; "When readers, listeners, and viewers download works for free, they are just taking the logic of Barthes's aesthetics to its fatal conclusion... all texts are already doing implicitly what postmodern works (from hip-hop tracks to novels by Kathy Acker) do explicitly and overtly:  they sample, they appropriate, they hybridize, they distort, they remix and recombine, the already-existing detritus of culture.  For Barthes, this is a joyous and wholly affirmative process, one that he describes in rapturously sexual terms.  But one man's /jouissance/ is another man's poison" (Shaviro 59); "But copyright piracy cannot possibly be creative; it's a pure expression of negativity and hatred, of what Freud calls the death instinct, and Nietzsche, /ressentiment/" (Shaviro 59-60); "For the sake of his very survival as an author, Jeter is compelled to wage war against his own readers" (Shaviro 60)

The Gift-Based Economy:  "Open-source free software and texts in the public domain are obscene.... The question is precisely one of /worth/.  In the globalized network society, the 'free market' is the sole arbiter of value; there is no standard of worth, other than the economic one" (Shaviro 61)

Immutable Laws:  Jeter points out that "the question of intellectual property is not merely a technological one.  It is political and economic, first of all" (Shaviro 62); "For Barlow, technology determines how we define private property.  For Jeter, to the contrary, it is struggles over property that determine which technologies we develop in the first place.  Unlimited copying is now technically possible, but so is a system of tracking so precise, and so extensive, that not a single byte, in any machine, anywhere, will escape being identified and accounted for" (Shaviro 62)

House Rules:  "In our heavily networked society, private individuals do not have the same rights as multinational corporations.  Each individual may be a node in the network, but the corporation is the network itself.  The more corporations are recognized as persons, as has increasingly been the case under United States law, the less unincorporated individuals are able to be so recognized" (Shaviro 63)

The Mediasphere:  electronic media = contemporary "nature"; "Sampling is the best way, and perhaps the /only/ way, for art to come to terms with a world of brand names, corporate logos, and simulacra" (Shaviro 64); "The law of copyright, as it is currently evolving, means that only large corporations, or artists 'for hire' in their employ, will be able to pay for the samples that they need" (Shaviro 65)

Deconstructing Beck:  Illegal Art CD; "In terms of both its production and its distribution, /Deconstructing Beck/ thus asks basic questions about ownership and copyright.  Who owns the images and sounds that are all around us?  What does it mean to own a sound or image anyway?..." (Shaviro 66); commentary on Beck's own uses of sampling:  "Of course, Beck can only do this because his samples are paid for by Geffen Records.... And it's this privilege that /Deconstructing Beck/ seeks to expose, by translating his music into more dissonant and abrasive forms" (Shaviro 67)

The Cut-Up:  different meanings of sampling; "At one extreme, appropriation can be seen as a kind of complacent submission to the dominant form of the commodity.... At the other extreme, appropriation can be seen to work as a disruptive act of 'culture jamming' or of what the Situationists called /détournement/" (Shaviro 67)

The Politics of Sampling:  role of sampling in hip-hop culture; "Appropriation in hip-hop is neither subversive nor conformist; it neither challenges the commodity form nor complacently celebrates it.  Rather, hip-hop sampling is an affirmative practice, an exuberant act of reclamation and reconstruction" (Shaviro 69)

Blond Ambition:  "Beck complicates, and raises to a higher power, the old story according to which white artists have so often ripped off black artists, getting rich by imitating the latter's musical innovations.  In contrast to, say, Mick Jagger, Beck exculpates himself by freely admitting that he is stealing" (Shaviro 69)

Beyond the Society of the Spectacle:  Debord on spectacle as "a global phenomenon of alienation and mystification" (Shaviro 70); "But isn't it actually Debord himself who is deluded?  There never was a time when life was 'directly lived,' instead of being diverted into representations" (Shaviro 70); there is no totalizing spectacle in the age of the Internet, but instead "a plethora of tiny spectacles, each of which calls explicit attention to its own status of merely being a spectacle" (Shaviro 71)

In Memory of My Feelings:  the waning of affect, deplored by Jameson, but celebrated by Warhol; "With the television on, no problem is desperate or urgent any longer.  Whatever it is, it's just part of the flow" (Shaviro 72)

Fascination:  "The exchange between this vampiric gaze and this zombified body is the play of fascination.  Such is the postmodern, or posthuman, equivalent of love" (Shaviro 73)

Even Better Than the Real Thing:  the mystique of celebrity; "To be is to be perceived" (Shaviro 74); "We used to think that beautiful looks and surfaces existed on their own and that they were only later reflected in the mirror of the media.  But now we know that there is no such reflection.  For the surface of things and the surface of the media mirror are already one and the same.  And beauty is the effect of this identity, not its cause" (Shaviro 74)

Fifteen Minutes:  Warhol & celebrity; "genuinely democratic" sentiment (Shaviro 75)

Almost Famous:  "It's hard to 'speak truth to power' when your very act of speaking is being marketed as entertainment" (Shaviro 76-77)

Exposure:  the first webcam, monitoring a coffee pot at Cambridge; JenniCam; "what the JenniCam shows is unimportant, compared to the sheer fact that it is always on, so that Jenni's life is presented to the world in its sheer ordinariness" (Shaviro 78)

Don't Look Now:  proliferation of webcams; "It is not a question, therefore, of Panoptical surveillance, but rather of an over-the-top performative exhibitionism" (Shaviro 79)

Family Values:  Stuart Tiros III; "This is American suburban family life in all its vapidity.  But the banality of everyday existence resists being made public.  You cannot observe someone's intimate experience without violating it.... Stuart Tiros's photos are disturbing, then, less because of what they tell us than simply because of the sheer fact that they are online.  For the Web site is Stuart's sole proof and verification of his own existence:  I have a home page, therefore I am" (Shaviro 81)

Prosthetic:  except that Tiros is fictional, "part of a multimedia installation /Prosthetic/ by William Scarbrough" (Shaviro 81); "Yet in this context, fictional need not mean unreal.... It is just that the virtual realm seems to operate according to a logic of infinite regress.  There is no pregiven, natural reference point, no first or final term.  Everything virtual is a hyperlink; everything else is a reference to, or a prosthesis for, something else" (Shaviro 82)

Esse Is Percipi:  George Berkeley on 'to be is to be perceived'; "Cognitive scientists start from the assumption, not that computers should be understood by comparison to human minds, but rather than human minds themselves can already be understood in terms of computers... cognitive scientists conceive minds, on the model of digital computers, as information processors that work by performing logical operations upon internal representations of external phenomena" (Shaviro 83); can use Berkeley to say that "our experience is always already virtual" (Shaviro 83)

Eyes Wide Shut:  consequences of Berkeley's assertion that things are only real because we perceive them do not include their ceasing to exist when we stop looking; "To be online is already to be perceived.  Even if no one ever visits your Web site, you are still visible to the network itself.  For the network is God, the unsleeping omni-voyeur.  The /cogito/ of virtual reality therefore reads:  I am connected, therefore I exist" (Shaviro 85)

Saving the Appearances:  Berkeley's claim that his argument has "no pragmatic consequences" (Shaviro 85); "In an immaterial world -- or what is the same, a virtual world -- nothing is hidden, and everything is precisely what it seems" (Shaviro 86)

What Is Mind?  No Matter:  Barlow's early celebrations of cyberspace; "What's crucial here is the separation of transactions and relationships from the bodies that give rise to them and that enter into them" (Shaviro 87); too idealist

What Is Matter?  Never Mind:  "We get uneasy, and suspicious, when we learn that so many things are simulations.  Disney's California AdventureTM is a simulation of the State of California, but isn't California itself already a simulation of the American Dream, which in turn is itself a simulation?" (Shaviro 88); The Matrix doesn't go far enough, as Zizek suggests -- it's not just that the spoon doesn't exist, but that the subject doesn't, either

The Ghost in the Machine:  "How does the network control us?... The problem is less that we are in prison than that we do not realize that we are" (Shaviro 89); "By definition, othing that we can do /within/ the simulation is of any consequence.  Freedom can only mean that we reject virtual reality altogether" (Shaviro 90); "But this is where the film tries to have it both ways.  It wants to condemn simulation and at the same time profit from it.... We might do well to say, updating Nietzsche: 'I fear we are not getting rid of the Matrix because we still believe in special effects'" (Shaviro 90)

The Big Picture:  Burroughs, /Cities of the Red Night/; enslavement by the Real; "it is not the prison of the mind that we have to fear, but far worse -- the prison of the body" (Shaviro 91)

Body and Soul:  Foucault's claim that "the soul is the prison of the body"; "The soul determines -- and enforces -- the limits of what the imprisoned body can do....  My soul is the virtual portion of my being: the set of all constraints, and conditions of possibility, that come together to make me who I am" (Shaviro 92); "the soul whose powers I unfurl, and whose dictates I fulfill, is not really anything of mine.  It just 'inhabits' me, and animates me, like a viral infection or a demonic possession" (Shaviro 92)

Ontology of the Virtual:  novels of Philip K. Dick, and "paradoxes of shifting levels of reality" (Shaviro 92); sometimes seems like the protagonists are going crazy, but sometimes much more than that; "Dick is commonly said to be asking questions about what is real, what is authentically human, and how we can ever know for certain about such things.  The most acute readings... ask metaquestions about these more basic questions" (Shaviro 93); "I would like to suggest that Dick's concerns are ontological before they are epistemological or hermeneutical.  That is to say, Dick's novels are primarily about the /being/ of simulation and virtual reality" (Shaviro 93-94)

Money Is a Kind of Poetry:  Dick, /Ubik/; household objects are sentient and have legal status as subjects; money as index of reality

Half-Life:  /Ubik/ -- is character dead?; Ubik = aerosol spray can; character's world as "half-life" simulation

Only Apparently Real:  the "full-life world" turns out to be another "half-life" simulation; instability of appearances

The Simulacral Body:  "In the contemporary imagination, virtual reality is often equated with disembodiment" (Shaviro 99); see /Neuromancer/; long history of hatred of the body in Western culture; materiality of simulacra in ancient thought

The Visions Became Flesh:  the process of 'coming to body' of virtual systems in Gibson's /All Tomorrow's Parties/

The Erotic Life of Machines:  video for Bjork's "All Is Full of Love," reimagining of the android, suggesting "that robots might well be more sensitive than we are.  They might have more exquisite perceptions than we have.  They might respond, more delicately than we do, to subtler gradations of change.  And they might have a higher tolerance for ambiguity" (Shaviro 103)

Birth of the Cool:  def. of cyborg includes sense in which body has been "taken over" by technology, implying "at the very least, a prosthetic replacement, if not an all-out viral invasion" (Shaviro 103); McLuhan on technologies as extensions of the human body; "Each time we extend ourselves technologically, some part of the real gives way to the virtual.  This is why every cultural innovation is attended by an ambivalent sense of loss.  And this is also why we tend to equate /virtual/ with /disembodied/, even though it would be more accurate to use it as an equivalent for /prosthetic/" (Shaviro 104); Haraway's cyborg as the figure of the permeability of the borders between human/animal, biological/machine, physical/nonphysical

Dancing with the Virtual Dervish:  experience of VR installation

Inside Out:  virtual space of /Dervish/ is the inside of the artist's body, based on an MRI

Gravity:  vertigo produced by VR experience, "the well-known /simulation sickness/:  the incoherence between the virtual sensory input one receives and the sensations that one continues to get from one's surroundings becomes too much for the body to handle" (Shaviro 107); demonstrates that "Simulations are effective because they address our embodied senses and not because they would somehow allow us to escape form the body" (Shaviro 108)

The Wedge:  Jeter's /Noir/, virtual zone known as "the Wedge"

Now or Never:  "In /Noir/, the virtual is the realm of memory, and the actual is what takes place in the immediate moment.  But of course, this means that the virtual is nearly everything" (Shaviro 110)

Supplemental:  "Virtuality is both the cause of the world's incompleteness and the remedy for it" (Shaviro 111); from the Baudrillardian perspective, the problem with the virtual is that "it is both too little and too much.  It is flimsy and superficial, devoid of real depth or serious content.  But this very deficiency leads to its alarming capacity for viral proliferation" (Shaviro 112); on the other hand, "virtuality is the one saving grace that makes up for the world's otherwise chronic unreality" (Shaviro 112); both necessary and frivolous

Virtual Light:  mutual dependence of the actual and the virtual, "something like the [relation] between hardware and software" (Shaviro 113); Kurzweil on downloading the self, as though self were software only; "the brain's 'handling of information' is itself a 'life process' that depends upon, and in turn affects, the 'structural integrity' of the neurons" (Shaviro 114)

Preemptive Multitasking:  "it might be best to forget about running the same software on many pieces of hardware and focus instead upon the converse idea of running multiple software programs at once on a single pieces of hardware.  Why worry about transporting myself into another body when I still haven't realized how many selves are present in this body that I already have?" (Shaviro 114-15); relative normality of such multipleness:  "You cannot be one without being at least two" (Shaviro 115); "The point is not to eliminate these multiple identities, ut rather to get them to talk to one another and to find ways for them to continue cohabiting with each other, in their one shared body, without too much distress or conflict" (Shaviro 115)

The Turing Test:  illusionary quality of computer multitasking:  "a computer's operations are /actually/ linear and sequential, but /virtually/ they are multiple and synchronous" (Shaviro 116); relationship to consciousness:  "Consciousness is not thought itself, but an easily accessible simulation of thought.  The brain's operations are /actually/ multiple and synchronous, but /virtually/, they are linear and sequential" (Shaviro 116); argues that "the question of whether the brain actually is a Turing Machine and the question of whether the brain can be simulated by a Turing Machine are entirely separate issues.  Second, if there does turn out to be some sort of brain activity that cannot be simulated by a computer, then this activity will turn out to be unconscious as well, and indeed radically inaccessible to consciousness" (Shaviro 117)

Deus Ex Machina:  artificial intelligence, hive mind; Kevin Kelly, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Hans Moravec, Ray Kurzweil; relationship of AIs to gods

Posthuman Politics:  Ken MacLeod, /The Stone Canal/

The Singularity:  "Vernor Vinge seems to have been the first to have announced the coming Singularity:  the moment at which the creation of a superhuman, machine-based intelligence will result in 'a regime as radically different from our human past as we humans are from the lower animals...From the human point of view this change will be a throwing away of all the previous rules, perhaps in the blink of an eye, an exponential runaway beyond any hope of control'" (Shaviro 120); those who do not 'get with the program' will be totally left behind

I'll Teach You Differences:  Kurzweil on singularity

On the Paralogisms of Virtual Reason:  Nietzsche's /Übermensch/; "The problems with [Vinge and Kurzweil's] speculations about the Singularity is not that they see the future as being different from, and radically discontinuous with, the past.  The problem is rather that they translate this difference into something like a necessary and continual upward progression to a state of transcendence" (Shaviro 122); "Kurzweil's reasoning is based on what Kany called a 'transcendental paralogism': a syllogism that is formally incorrect, because it claims to deduce positive concepts from a proposition that in itself is only a logical form devoid of any particular content" (Shaviro 123)

The Rapture for Nerds:  MacLeod on the singularity and its politics

The Lady or the Tiger:  the dangers of the beauty of the posthuman

Foglets:  nanobots used to simulate objects of desire

Wetware:  squeamishness of AI enthusiasts "when it comes to the actual messiness of biological 'wetware,' or anything else that isn't dry as dust and silicon chips" (Shaviro 127); the "merger of biology and information processing" (Shaviro 127) in genome projects

The Culture of Real Virtuality:  relationship of virtual reality to money:  "Money at once grounds and volatilizes virtual reality" (Shaviro 128); money makes it happen, but money is itself increasingly virtual; see studies of reorganization of capital from David Harvey, Manuel Castells; Castells on the "novelty and importance, not of information per se, but of technologies that actually use information as their 'raw material'" (Shaviro 129); "Financial speculation and the electronic media are thus locked together in a mutually reinforcing, positive feedback loop" (Shaviro 129)

Out of Time and into Space:  Castells on 'space of flows' versus 'space of places'; privileging of space over time in postmodern; emergence of 'timeless time,' "characterized by the negation of duration" (Shaviro 130), assists in the "overall subordination of time to space" (Shaviro 131)

Space Is the Place:  Jameson and 'hyperspace'; "The predominant form of human interaction in this space is /networking/" (Shaviro 131), now freed from physical proximity and flourishing globally; the logic of the space of flows; "The space of places is often looked back upon nostalgically as a site of 'community,' where everyone helped their neighbors, and nobody was reduced to the fate of 'bowling alone.'  This is rather a dubious idealization: old-time, small-town communities were just as often characterized by bitter enmities, malicious gossip, and the heavy-handed imposition of censorious, bigoted 'community standards'" (Shaviro 132); what is crucial, however, about the space of places is *contact*; "The space of places is less that of nostalgically idealized traditional communities than that of turbulent urban modernity.  It is the space o the urban /flâneur/, memorably evoked by Walter Benjamin.  And one of the big questions today, facing artists, thinkers, and activists alike, is how to find a twenty-first century equivalent, within the space of flows, for Benjaminian /flâneurie/ and Delaneyesque contact" (Shaviro 132-33)

The Trinity Formula:  three material layers of the space of flows:  the hardware and software; the geography of the network; the space of the financial and political elite

Eden-Olympia:  J. G. Ballard, /Super-Cannes/; the privatization of public life, as well as personal lives

The Power Elite:  Castells on corporate rulers as 'managerial elites'; "their power is not founded /directly/ upon ownership of the means of production.  Rather, it is mediated by their having privileged access to global networks of financial transactions and flexible, lateral connections" (Shaviro 136); this freedom, however, requires that work subsume everything:  'Work is the new leisure'

Rest and Recreation:  "vigilante street sweeps" as tension-reducers in Eden-Olympia; "In the new network economy, such controlled outbursts of ritual violence are the motor of personal growth and corporate innovation alike" (Shaviro 138)

Big Pimpin':  management style based on pimping, keeping employees insecure

Go with the Flow:  "Castells sardonically remarks that the ruling elites of the network society live and work comfortably in the space of flows, but they 'do not want [to] and cannot become flows themselves'" (Shaviro 139)

Overload:  disorientation of networks; fictional representations of information-overload diseases "are consequences of Landauer's Principle:  the strange fact that, while no energy is needed to create and transmit information, some energy is needed to destroy it" (Shaviro 141)

Out of the Past:  /Noir/ and McNihil's film noir overlay as a doomed attempt to escape network society

Dark, Annihilating Beauty:  why do we love noir?  "Bill Beard suggests that the allure of today's retro noir stylization is that it makes even the most intolerable situations bearable precisely by aestheticizing them, by making them beautiful" (Shaviro 144)

Time Out of Mind:  end of history and Jamesonian sense of the dilation of culture to efface all else; but why noir?  "The myth of noir... is really the myth of an autonomous (masculine) self.  And the experience of being betrayed is the test, and the proof, of that self's authenticity" (Shaviro 146)

A Desperate Fantasy:  noir used as "bulwark against postmodern emptiness and inauthenticity" (Shaviro 146), but "in fact, noir is less an alternative to postmodern simulation than it is itself already an example of it" (Shaviro 147); Pynchon, /Gravity's Rainbow/

The Pseudoromantic Mystique of Film Noir:  "built-in obsolescence" of noir, which was always already past (Shaviro 148); /Blade Runner/; "Mourning the supposed loss of the real (as Baudrillard and /Blade Runner/ both do) is actually a way of preserving it unquestioned" (Shaviro 149)

New Rose Hotel:  noir in Gibson; zaibatsus as hive entities

The Edge:  the idea of genius as cultural myth, and "basic myth of capitalism" (Shaviro 152); individualist myth but always reabsorbed by network

/Delectatio Morosa/:  film version of "New Rose Hotel"

What Do Women Want?:  femme fatale and the gendered nature of noir mythology

You Can't Put Your Arm around a Memory:  uses of memory/flashback in film version of "New Rose Hotel"

The Dead Man:  noir's relationship to betrayal; "It's precisely because the noir hero's self has so little actual substance that it needs to be validated, and made concrete, through betrayal.  But in the 'radical disillusion' of the network society, where everyone connects everyone else, even betrayal isn't enough.  It is too commonplace; everybody does it" (Shaviro 158)

Indeadted:  "In the network society, where every human transaction is instantly monetized and commodified, indebtedness is what makes it all work.  You are only as good as your line of credit" (Shaviro 159); "There's no longer any need to lock me up in order to regulate my behavior; I can be controlled much more easily through my financial records -- which have the added advantage of tagging along with me, no matter where I go" (Shaviro 159); Octavia Butler, /Parable/, and debt slavery; in /Noir/, the indeadted are zombified until they pay off their debts

Debt and Death:  traditional relationship between debt and death, in which latter in some sense pays off the former

Life-in-Death:  "But in the network society, the relationship between debt and death is inverted.  Rather than death resolving and canceling debt, debt extends the moment of death interminably" (Shaviro 161)

I Can't Go On, I'll Go On:  "In the network society, you are what you owe, instead of what you eat" (Shaviro 162); Deleuze on the control society (as opposed to the disciplinary society); debt as key aspect of control society

Children of Production:  "the ways that monsters are intrinsic to the ordinary, everyday reality of capitalism itself" (Shaviro 164), esp. vampires and zombies; D&G: 'the myth of the zombie, of the living dead, is a work myth and not a war myth'

The Tendential Fall of the Rate of Profit:  zombies and labor; devaluing labor is a "short term solution that, in the longer term, only worsens the problem, for the dead weight of accumulated zombie labor acts as a sort of brake on the continued valorization of capital" (Shaviro 165)

The Call of Cthulhu:  aristocratic nature of the vampire produces its obsolescence; "Vampires today are popular commodities, probably more popular than ever, but they are not really terrifying any longer.  Rather, they feed our native hunger for a safe dose of exoticism" (Shaviro 167-68); Cthulhu as better model for capitalism than vampire

Slake-Moths:  Miéville, /Perdido Street Station/, and its configuration of vampire and zombie as slake-moth and victim; zombie not as alienated worker, but an exhausted source of value

Capitalism with an Inhuman Face:  inhumanness of slake-moths; "in their rapacity and insatiability -- and indeed, in their very presence in the air over the city -- the slake-moths are an expression, or better an /exudation/ (to use a word Miéville favors), of the self-valorizing movements of capital" (Shaviro 170); "the crucial point about such a cancerous pathology is that it is nothing more than a monstrous intensification of the 'normal' functioning of the system infected by it" (Shaviro 170-71)

Dawn of the Dead:  zombies as "the 'human face' of capitalist monstrosity" (Shaviro 171)

Snow Crash:  the moment of system crash can come in the form of a virus, but also a prototype Information Bomb

Bliss:  only way out of life's pain in /Noir/: male fantasy of being implanted in uterus

Switched Off:  "there is no outside to the space of flows" (Shaviro 175); argues that the digital divide is not one of connected the network vs. those not (yet) connected, but that "these people and places have been actively /disconnected/ from the network" (Shaviro 176)

All That Is Solid Melts into Air:  Jeter's vision of Seattle, and the fusion of bodies into one another

Fade Away and Radiate:  "Time and again, activists have invented all sorts of creative and subversive ways to manipulate the very media that have been manipulating them.  But they have never been able to erase the fact that, precisely because of ubiquitous mediatization, their resistance is always compromised from the outset" (Shaviro 179-80)

The Whole World Is Watching:  "If the network is full of desperate exhibitionists, each of them presenting the spectacle of his or her life in a Web cam broadcast that nobody else watches, then the life of the silent [disconnected] masses is precisely the reverse:  collectively, they present a spectacle that is watched by everyone else but of which they themselves remain blissfully unaware" (Shaviro 181)

Red Spider, White Web:  Misha novel set in Ded Tek

Living Metal:  more on Ded Tek

The Day the World Turned Day-Glo:  touchy-feely Ecstasy-like Mickey-san

Remix/Remodel:  drugs as media, in McLuhanesque sense, extensions of the self; drugs act "as agonists or antagonists of the various neurotransmitter receptors.... Taking drugs is thus a kind of biological engineering" (Shaviro 186); drugs as remixing consciousness

The Antinomy of Psychedelic Reason:  "The psychedelic experience short-circuits the distinction between the observing self (the self as transcendental subject, or subject of enunciation) and the observed self (the self as empirical entity, or subject of statements)" (Shaviro 186); "the psychedelic experience lies at the heart of the Kantian antinomy that structures our contemporary understanding of consciousness.  On the one hand, we reduce mind to a mere series of biochemical effects; on the other hand, we inflate it into a principle of authenticity" (Shaviro 187)

Homage to Psychedelia:  "Psychedelic drugs and electronic technologies affect the sensorium in strikingly similar ways... psychedelics are the drugs that resonate most powerfully with the space of flows" (Shaviro 188); "by overflowing the limits of representation, LSD mimics, and coincides with, the flows of the network itself.  LSD doesn't 'represent' the space of multinational capital, but it doubles that space, accompanying each of its folks and convolutions and miming each of its convulsions" (Shaviro 189)

Before and after Science:  "LSD is to organic psychedelics... as a flight in a Sopwith Camel (in which 'you could hear the air shrieking over the control surfaces and feel the wind blasting your face') is to a voyage on the space shuttle" (Shaviro 189-90) -- interestingly, both described in terms of technology; "in our electronically networked society, the 'archaic revival' can only take the form of an audioanimatronic simulation" (Shaviro 191)

Contentless and Abrasive:  LSD as psychic Drano; LSD as "universal equivalent and translator for affect, just as money is for commodities, as DNA is for living bodies, and as digitized information is for all the media of expression" (192); such equivalents are at first simple mediums of exchange, but later take on lives of their own, no longer 'representing' objects but instead becoming their "animating principle" (Shaviro 192)

Me and My Shadow:  how are multiple flows (commodities, expression, embodiment, affect) of the postmodern interrelated? via the flow of thought, or affect, which "parallels the flows of all the other attributes, but with an infinitesimal delay, like an echo.  And this gap, this echo or shadow, is where subjectivity is born" (Shaviro 194)

Babylon Babies:  "What mutations, what transformations, might emerge from the space of flows?  And how might psychedelic consciousness facilitate these transformations?" (Shaviro 194-95); Dantec's /Babylon Babies/ and nonliner, embodied posthumanism

Embrace the Serpent:  the 'neuromatrix' and schizoanalysis

Cocaine:  "In certain ways, it might seem that cocaine, rather than LSD, is the symptomatic drug of the world-wide marketplace" (Shaviro 197); testimony of a cocaine addict

A Syringe Full of Manhood:  Actually, that testimony is from Andrew Sullivan, "rhapsodizing over the wonders of testosterone" (Shaviro 198)

Sense and Antisense:  "The delirium of LSD and other psychedelics marks the outer limit of the space of flows, its point of maximum expansion.  Conversely, the delirium of testoterone, or of cocaine, marks its inner limit, its point of maximum contraction.  On the one side, an ecstatic, self-dissolving embrace of the cosmos and all its flows, a swooning abandonment that has all too often been stereotyped as feminine; on the other, a will to master the flows (or to die trying) in the name of masculine self-affirmation" (Shaviro 200); feminizing psychedelics broaden consciousness; masculinizing stimulants sharpen it; but both compromise subjectivity:  "whether I take on the 'feminine' role or the 'masculine' one, whether I give myself over to the flows, or try to appropriate them to myself, I still must acknowledge that they were here first, and that my very being is predicated upon them" (Shaviro 201)

Vegetable Mind:  imagining "something like a plant intelligence, slow-moving by animal standards, but vast and deep" (Shaviro 202)

In the Company of Mushrooms:  networks of fungi mycelia, which with "animal neurons, and Internet cables can join together to create highly distributed and massively parallel systems of information retrieval, computation, and communication" (Shaviro 204); connections to psychedelic effec of psilocybin mushroom

Just-So Stories:  because "there is scarcely any empirical evidence about how human language and consciousness evolved" (Shaviro 205), any explanations thereof are what Gould dismisses as "just-so stories"; "Even if a given adaptation is plausible and consistent, this does not guarantee that it is actually true" (Shaviro 205); problem with rhetoric of evolutionary thinkers such as Pinker, which "amounts to asserting that /any/ minimally coherent explanation is better than none at all" (Shaviro 206)

Reverse Engineering:  problematic use of metaphor in scientific discourse, esp. metaphor of goal

Purposiveness without a Purpose:  "we can and should use the idea of a purpose regulatively, as a guide to help us make sense of how an organism functions and how its features might have evolved.  It is scarcely possible for us to understand organisms in any other way.  But we should always keep in mind that such a purpose is not constitutive:  it is not the actual inner principle of the organism's functioning, nor is it actually present in the history of how the organism evolved... the idea of purpose is a kind of necessary fiction.  It is necessary, because it alone allows us to organize vast quantities of empirical data.  But it is a fiction, because it is not immanent to the field of data thus organized" (Shaviro 209)

Feedback:  "One reason that Kant sees /purpose/ as a regulative fiction, and not an empirical fact, is that any explanation of a thing in terms of the purpose it serves leads to a disturbing reversal of causality" (Shaviro 210); oddness of Pinker's comparison of human goals to feedback mechanism of thermostat; "Pinker's arguments about goal and purpose are both circular and inconsistent.  They fall into the paralogisms and antinomies that must result from any attempt to use the idea of purpose constitutively instead of regulatively" (Shaviro 212)

Efficiency:  "The theories of evolutionary biology and free-market economics are similar in many ways" (Shaviro 212); "But these two theories are more than just structurally equivalent.  There is also a deep affinity between them, in terms of style and affect.  Practitioners of both tend to be obsessed with questions of efficiency and utility.  They reject the idea that anything found in nature or society could ever by arbitrary, meaningless, or irrational" (Shaviro 213); "Everything is permitted, except for a failure of rationality" (Shaviro 213)

Money for Nothing:  the waste of the long-tailed bird of paradise:  "a self-crippling extravagance that ... works as a signal of desirability as a mate.... Waste and inefficiency turn out to have a second order utility after all" (Shaviro 214)

Ostentatious Waste:  "Extravagance is only a problem in conditions of scarcity.  If organisms are competing for limited resources, then waste is not just something that needs to be explained; it is something that positively must be explained away.  But under conditions of abundance, waste and extravagance are only to be expected" (Shaviro 215); connection of capitalist obsession with scarcity (and thus with efficiency) to Max Weber's protestant ethic; "In our postmodern, globally networked world, the motor of capitalist accumulation is not carefully controlled reinvestment, but manic consumer spending, and even more manic financial speculation" (Shaviro 216); "isn't the real problem with capitalism rather that it is never truly extravagant, never wasteful or useless enough?  Everything still comes down to the bottom line:  the need for profit, and immediate, short-term profit at that" (Shaviro 216)

Unproductive Expenditure:  Bataille on the useless and wasteful:  "Such activities as 'luxury, mourning, war, cults, the construction of sumptuary monuments, games, spectacles, arts, perverse sexual activity' serve no useful, economic purpose; rather 'the accent is placed on a /loss/ that must be as great as possible in order for that activity to take on its true meaning'" (Shaviro 216); "the infinite prodigality of the sun" (Shaviro 217); "Neither in the biosphere nor in the human economic sphere is scarcity given in advance.  Rather, scarcity is something that always needs to be produced and imposed" (Shaviro 217-18)

Potlatch:  Bataille on potlatch economies; ambiguity: "On the one hand, such ceremonies involve ostentatious expenditure... In this manner, they affirm life's exuberance, celebrating the extravagance of loss.  But on the other hand, these ceremonies are anything but gratuitous, in terms of their purposes and outcomes.  They are vehicles both for creating alliances and for waging war symbolically" (Shaviro 218-19); cannot be explained via economic rationality

As Shameful as Belching:  "The great paradox of capitalism is the reverse of the one that haunts archaic economies.  What needs to be explained is no longer the fact that spontaneous acts of expenditure, like sacrifices and gifts, also turn out to serve useful purposes for the people who perform them, but rather the fact that an economy entirely given over to utilitarian calculation, or to 'rational choice,' still continues to express -- if only underhandedly, and by inversion -- the delirious logic of unproductive expenditure" (Shaviro 220-21); "In short, even as it produces greater material wealth than every before in human history, capitalism also continually manufactures scarcity and want" (Shaviro 221)

Explosion:  capitalism was "the first economic system to dissimulate the process of expenditure that fuels it and turn that process back upon itself" (Shaviro 221), reinvesting in its reproduction and expansion; "But this strategy of intensification only works up to a certain point.  Its very success leads it to the brink.... The point of total saturation is eventually reached.  Capitalism is strangled by its own luxuriant growth.  It is no longer able to consume its own excess" (Shaviro 222); "Marxists have hoped for well over a century to see capitalism collapse from its self-generated crises, which is to say from its internal contradications.  But the trouble is that these very crises and contradictions are /also/ what keep capitalism alive" (Shaviro 222)

A Postmodern Metaphysics:  "Modernity sought to eradicate all metaphysics, but it discovered, in spite of itself, that this is impossible" (Shaviro 223); "Metaphysics is not about objects in the world, in their presence and positivity.  It is rather about the spaces between things, their zones of fuzziness and indiscernibility" (Shaviro 223); "The Marxist idea of crisis, Bataille's notion of expenditure, and Deleuze and Guattari's concept of undecidability, are all ways of walking inbetween -- of invoking /extrabeing/ -- in order to oppose the solidity, the inertia, and the seeming self-evidence of the actual.  They are ways of finding ambiguous points of potential, gaps in the linear chain of causality, unexpected openings to new, emergent processes" (Shaviro 224)

Crisis Energy:  crisis theory in Miéville's /Perdido Street Station/

Biological Exuberance:  "The events of natural history, like those of human history, can be narrated in many different ways.  They can be explained from a perspective of scarcity and need, but also from one of 'fruitless prodigality' and exuberance" (Shaviro 227)

I Want to Believe:  how to explain the existence of religion and our desire to believe?  "Orthodox sociobiologists tend to argue that the propensity for religious belief is somehow hardwired into our genes.  It must have some adaptive value for humanity -- or at least, it must have had such value in the past.... Dawkins, however, will have none of this.  He argues that 'the mental virus of faith' had no adaptive value for us whatsoever.  Just like biological and computer viruses, it is a parasite that promotes its own replication at our expense.  Belief is only advantageous for the religious meme itself, not for the human bodies and brains that are its host" (Shaviro 228)

Nature and Culture:  difference between memes and genes lies in the fact that there is no distinction in memes between the germ plasm that does the reproducing and the rest of the body, which has important consequences:  "First, Lamarckian inheritance -- the passing on of acquired traits -- is the rule for memes, whereas it is impossible for genes.  Second, group selection is a much more plausible mechanism for memes than it is for genes.  Third, memetic variations are not culled as ruthlessly by the forces of natural selection as are genetic differences.  And finally, memes do not spread by descent, as genes do; rather, memes are propagated laterally by a sort of contagion, or better, by a process of virulent imitation.  The result of all these differences is that memes vary much more widely, and change much more rapidly, than genes do" (Shaviro 229); "For this reason, we can say that culture inclines more to prodigality and excess, while nature inclines more to Malthusian scarcity, even if both sorts of processes are at work in both realms" (Shaviro 230)

Virulent Imitation:  Susan Blackmore on memetics; contagious propagation and differences between animal and human 'social learning'; human drive toward imitation produces not just copying but also competition

Funkentelechy versus the Placebo Syndrome:  Blackmore uses memes "to explain precisely those aspects of human culture that sociobiology cannot well account for" (Shaviro 232)

Trust the Force:  Dawkins's distinction between replicators and vehicles; Blackmore undermines by suggesting that the self is no more than a memeplex

Cyberspace versus Homunculus:  oppositions abound -- network/self, sampling/copyright, LSD/cocaine; artificial intelligence/human emotions, marketplace/flesh, replicators/vehicles, expenditure/utility, space of flows/space of places, vampire-capital/zombie-consumption; "the battle of Cyberspace versus Homunculus.  On one hand, the seamlessness and 'unthinkable complexity' of the system of posthuman, virtual existence; on the other hand, a stunted and shrunked residue of humanity, possibly monstrous" (Shaviro 235); but the terms are interrelated, "the first term is logically on a metalevel in relation to the second" (Shaviro 235); "The conflict, then, is not between two systems, or two sets of rules, but rather between a system and one of its own terms, or between a rule and one of its implementations" (Shaviro 236)

All Politics Is Local:  Samuel Delany's /Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand/ and universalization

Visible and Invisible Persons Distributed in Space:  "the vector of universalization... is the continual, networked flow of information" (Shaviro 238); the Web; "In short, the price of universalization is differential access and imposed scarcity.  Information is always /about/ particular localities, and even its distribution varies locally.  It is only the actual /flow/ of information -- the process by which it is disseminated, but also homogenized and filtered -- that can be described as universal, rather than local" (Shaviro 239)

General Information:  problems of translation and of controlling the use of information; "the Web does not -- and indeed cannot -- directly determine this additional process of signification and subjectification.  Other forces -- forces of interpretation and selection -- necessarily come into play.  And these other forces are intrinsically local; they stubbornly resist the pull of any system of universal equivalences (Shaviro 240)

Family and Sygn:  conflict between rival epistemologies in novel, "between an approach that phobically rejects difference and one that actively embraces it" (Shaviro 241)

The Dream of a Common Language:  fundamentalism as postmodern phenomenon, not a return to past systems of belief but a reaction against the present, a nostalgia for a past that never existed; suggests that Family and Sygn aren't so much opposed as mutually co-implicated; both ways of articulating local with universal; both take info economy for granted

Cultural Fugue:  in novel, point of technological complexity at which the population self-destructs; apocalyptic sense of danger as "a defining condition of life in the network society" (Shaviro 243)

Worklessness:  connection of Cultural Fugue to 'worklessness,' a "voracious appetite without a real object" (Shaviro 244); "What is most troubling about Cultural Fugue, in other words, is not annihilation per se, so much as the lack of finality, the /meaninglessness/ and gratuitousness, of this annihilation" (Shaviro 244-45)

Reverse Causality:  "When 'the Universe is overdetermined,' and every person, object, and point in space is a node in the network, then linear causality  no longer obtains" (Shaviro 245); cultural fugue is both a crisis of indeterminacy and massively overdetermined, at once

The Lineaments of Gratified Desire:  "Marq's and Rat Korga's desire is /extrabeing/, something that has no place in the totality of a world of information.  It is as extravagant and beyond representation, as impalpable and yet as overwhelming in its presence, in its sheer materiality, as Cultural Fugue itself.  Which may be why the two seem so strangely intertwined and cannot be completely disentangled from one another.  Cultural Fugue is the uncanny double, the dark shadow, the destructive inversion, of gratified desire" (Shaviro 247)

I Fought the Law, and the Law Won:  is there no way out of the network society, except through?  "The 'pirate utopia' of freewheeling experimentation gives way to a carefully ordered regime of capital accumulation.  Mega-corporations... are thereby able to gather all the products of social innovation in order to sell them back to us at a profit.  And that is the point at which we are all connected, unable to live without the network" (Shaviro 248-49)

What It Means to Live in the Network Society:  you can have anything, but you must pay the price -- both monetary and informational; but "what you get is never quite what you paid for.  It's always just a tiny bit less" (Shaviro 249)

The Theme Park of Desires:  Jeter -- 'the big happy theme park of desires that are always at the brink of satisfaction but somehow never get there'

Connected:  is it all just SF?  "science fiction does not claim to be reportage, just as it does not claim to be prophecy... it involves both the present and the future, while being reducible to neither.  For science fiction is about the shadow that the future casts upon the present.  It shows us how profoundly we are /haunted/ by the ghosts of what has not yet happened" (Shaviro 250)
