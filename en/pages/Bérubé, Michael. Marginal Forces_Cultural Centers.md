Introduction

"At no point in history has it been a simple enterprise to examine the cultural position and practices of academic literary study.  Though we speak often and obsessively of the present crisis in the profession (whatever we imagine this crisis to be), we do so in the knowledge that ours is a profession constituted in part by its sense of perpetual crisis…" (Bérubé 1)

"As we question the institutional practices by which literary canons are constructed and maintained, we also question, more broadly, the university's role as producer of knowledge and as reproducer of a social order in which knowledge is power and information is commodity.  We question the relation of critical intellectuals to popular culture, as well as the relation between intellectuals and their institutional matrices of power." (Bérubé 1)

can no longer speak about "the function of criticism," as it is clearly multiple and variable; discussing instead "the relation of institutional criticism to the work and critical reception of two writers who are nearly at the extremes of contemporary academic discourse:  Melvin Tolson and Thomas Pynchon" (Bérubé 2).

study of "how canonization works, or fails to work, for writers in the age of institutional criticism" (Bérubé 3)

two writers seen as a "marginal figure who wanted  nothing more than to be central; a newly central figure who apparently would like nothing better than marginality.  Yet within this complementarity lies a still deeper symmetry:  in the work and in the reception of both authors, we find invoked to widely different ends the post-Romantic construction of 'marginality' as the source of authorial authority.  That is, this idea of 'marginality' as empowerment is central both to the procedures by which we deconstruct the very notion of the canon (or the university, the museum, the archive) and to the demands of underrepresented groups that they be admitted to the canon.  Yet depending on the specific construction of the 'margin,' the empowerment enabled by marginality consists in access to (for Tolson) or refusal of (for Pynchon) the authority conferred by institutionalization." (Bérubé 3)

must problematize notion of marginality:  "It is easy to claim here, for instance, that the academic delineation of an 'avant-garde' constitutes a central culture's absorption and recuperation of the marginal forces that threaten and oppose it" (Bérubé 3)

Marxist reading of cultural processes:  "It is guaranteed, however, that in our present stage of capitalist and artistic production, no artifact can exist apart from its consumption and commodification; indeed, because any text's consumption is also its reproduction, we may say that consumption and reproduction constitute the existence of texts" (Bérubé 4)

"canons are at once the location, the index, and the record of the struggle for cultural representation; like any other hegemonic formation, they must be continually reproduced anew and are continually contested." (Bérubé 4-5)

"I want to examine the rhetoric of cultural marginality and the uses to which it is put by disparately positioned writers and critics." (Bérubé 5)

"It is possible to make academic canons less exclusive, more polymorphic — even, to some extent, more 'democratic'; but it is not possible for academic critics to forgo their roles as gatekeepers" (Bérubé 8)

"neither reader-response criticism nor reception theory had paid sufficient attention to the means by which writers structure and emplot their institutional readers and receptions, how interpretive communities and their cultural norms and values are located both within and by textual, rhetorical, and professional strategies specific to 'authorship' as practice and as sign." (Bérubé 9)

act of critical reading (especially "close reading") is an academic conferral of value upon a text

"it is by now axiomatic to post-Romantic thought that the rhetoric of marginality can be a powerful enabling device, even though marginality itself is synonymous with disempowerment:  to claim to speak from the margin is paradoxically to claim to speak from the position of authority, and to describe a margin is to describe an authoritative challenge to hegemony.  My challenge to this rhetoric of marginality takes two forms:  demystification, whereby I argue that Pynchon's putative 'margin' is not always as marginal as it appears; and negotiation, whereby I seek to demonstrate Tolson's importance without making the knee-jerk argument that he is important solely because he had been marginalized.  Margins are real, but they are always relational." (Bérubé 16-17)

Chapter 1:  Institutional Authorizations

"Put most bluntly, the question that faces us here is whether academicization is the life or death of 'culture.'  Is institutional literary study a means to the preservation of culture(s), or does it mark the death-by-assimilation of vibrant, challenging writers, movements, and modes of thought?  Of course, to put the question in this way is to muddy and falsify it, since 'life' and 'death' can be construed as variously as a Rorschach blot — even so as to be equivalent states.  On the side of 'life,' for instance, we have the argument that the function of the university is 'transmission of the cultural heritage,' an argument that has come in the last decade to involve an entire battery of keywords such as 'excellence,' 'legacy,' and 'value.'  Such 'transmission' turns out to be a profoundly passive enterprise whereby universities teach a central core of classical texts in the Western tradition, texts whose 'classic' and 'central' status has been enhanced in this century by their very presence in 'central' university curricula.  Thus, if we mean by 'preservation of culture' an intellectual and patriarchal embalming process for passing on to our students what our fathers passed on to us, then institutional 'life,' in my question above, is as ideologically suspect a code word for critical intellectuals as it is for advocates of women's reproductive rights." (Bérubé 18-19)

on the "professionalization" of literary study and the purposes of the academy (see PO entry 1.12.04)

canon revision as highest purpose of literary study?:  "I do think it is finally inadequate to generate 'new ways of reading' without also expanding our range of historical reading materials" (Bérubé 33)

"the dichotomy between changing texts and changing 'structures of thinking' is not comprehensible as a dichotomy.  For where did our newly canonical works come from if not from revised structures of thinking or, to use the term I prefer, revised reading practices?" (Bérubé 33)

on Pynchon and Tolson:  "When the two are read against each other, each becomes the other's foil:  Tolson's academic aspirations are mocked by Pynchon, but Pynchon's ignorance or dismissal of his academic reception is mocked by Tolson; Pynchon's reception demonstrates that canons are made, not born, that reception is less a matter of 'time' than of serious reviews in influential intellectual journals; Tolson's reception responds that Pynchon's vaunted 'marginality' is a highly privileged affair, the stance of a writer who can well afford not to cooperate in his commodification and canonization." (Bérubé 37)
