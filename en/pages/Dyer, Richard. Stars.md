Dyer, Richard.  Stars.  London: BFI Publishing, 1979.


INTRODUCTION

reasons for studying film stars: sociological/semiotic
part one: stars as a social phenomenon (why do stars signify?)
part two: stars as images (what do stars signify?)
part three: stars as signs (how do stars signify?)
ideology — Althusserian definition?

I. STARS AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON

1. Condition for Stardom

2. Production:Consumption

origins of stardom
stars as a phenomenon of production
economics; manipulation (Boorstin: star as pseudo-event); fashion, the nature of the medium; magic and talent
stars as a phenomenon of consumption
needs, dreams, and the collective unconscious

3. Ideology (ideological effect)

star versus character
life as theatre
a historical paradigm — from gods to mortals
stars and the status quo
reinforcement of values under threat
displacement of values
compensation
charisma

II. STARS AS IMAGES

“Star images function crucially in relation to contradictions within and between ideologies, which they seek variously to ‘manage’ or resolve.” (Dyer 38)

1. Stars as Stars

consumption (conspicuous and otherwise)
ordinariness — are stars different?
the dream soured
love

2. Stars as Types

the notion of social type
alternative or subversive types

3. Stars as Specific Images

promotion, publicity, films, criticism and commentaries (media texts which make a star image)
a specific image: Jane Fonda

III. STARS AS SIGNS

1. Stars and “Character”

the notion of character
the cultural-historical specificity of notions of character
the novelistic conception of character
alternative conceptions of character
the construction of character
signs of character
problems of character construction in film
stars as characters in films

2. Stars and Performance

trends in the study of performance
performance signs

3.  A Note on Authorship

who is the author of a film? who is the author of a star?
