Johnston, John.  Information Multiplicity:  American Fiction in the Age of Media Saturation.  Baltimore:  Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998.

Introduction

information theory and cybernetics assist in “the immense techno-scientific transformation of the world into coded bits of ‘information’ and ‘machinic’ assemblages.” (Johnston 1)

transformation of processes into information helps create new “lingua franca of control” (Johnston 1)

instrumentalist definitions of information give way to new visions of complexity, emergence, chaos theory; information now refers even colloquially to multiple orders

“what most distinguishes information at the human level is its viral power, its tendency to proliferate” (Johnston 2); “But information theory and cybernetics have also made possible new ways of thinking about basic concepts such as control, organization, machines, and life itself.  Thus, while information has led to a new medium of control, it has also generated something that always exceeds control.” (Johnston 2)

“information multiplicity” — “profoundly corrosive of older cultural forms and identities, dissolving subjects and objects alike into systems, processes, and nodes in the circuits and flow of information exchange” (Johnston 3)

“Contemporary culture — or more specifically, what is called postmodern techno- or cyberculture — is a restructuring process that can be similarly  described:  as an artifactual space created when information restructures modern or traditional culture in order to make it a better habitat for information.” (Johnston 3)

novels from 1973 to 1991; two kinds:  novels of information multiplicity and novels of media assemblages

between, a shift in conditions of mediality:  “Where the novel of information multiplicity defines and even constitutes an always excessive and polysemic information field in which the uncertainty and ambiguity of information are both problem and solution, truth and  method, the novel of media assemblages evolves from the former when information becomes fully quantified and digitalized (or is assumed to be so) and no longer carried its former viral and semantic potential.” (Johnston 4)

Part 1:  Writing (in) the Machinic Universe

1.  The Literary Assemblage:  Writing Machines and Late Capitalism

novel of information multiplicity “works both within and against the whole apparatus of information proliferation and control which, since the 1970s, has come to typify ‘late-capitalist’ American culture” (Johnston 11)

“in a culture in which events are created or usurped in advance by their mass-media simulations, contemporary writers can no longer rely upon strategies defined by a stable opposition between the fictional and the real” (Johnston 12); uncertainty of information itself becomes crucial issue

novel of information multiplicity = “a fictional assemblage produced by a writing machine” (Johnston 13)

novel “responds to the new cultural and technological context in two interrelated ways:  first, through writing strategies that not only register information in all its contradictory semantic aspects but reenact the logic of its proliferation; and second, through a fundamental interest in how that information is received, recorded, and disseminated in relation to new information technologies, on the one hand, and new subjects, on the other.”  (Johnston 13)

viral proliferation of information:  “Only a literary form that is machinic, therefore, and which takes the form of an assemblage, can fully register how various information systems, including the mass media, function as part of a larger apparatus of information production and control, while at the same time participating in processes that always exceed them.” (Johnston 14)

assemblage:  from D&G: “a multiplicity made up of heterogeneous terms and functions that work together in a symbiosis, or sympathy…. An assemblage, therefore, constitutes not a structural unity or totality but only a functional consistency or ‘jelling together’ of diverse parts and processes.  In short, it is nothing more than a functional arrangement of material and semiotic flows, and it has no other meaning than that ‘it works’.” (Johnston 14)

two kinds of assemblage:  machinic assemblage of desire and collective assemblage of enunciation; “a reciprocally determinant arrangement of bodies and words” (Johnston 15)

writing as assemblage — rhizomatic; writing as “always a writing with” (Johnston 15) as part of an assemblage; writing serves to map the flows of desire

all novels as potentially multiplicitous, but most reigned in to unity by convention

D&G:  “the writing machine” — “the assemblage that certain writers have invented in order to make a multiplicity ‘outside’ pass into writing” (Johnston 16-17) — explored in Kafka:  Towards a Minor Literature

“whereas Kafka’s writing machine involves a particular setup between typewriter and bureaucracy, two essential components of the agency, or agencement, through which the night thoughts of a solitary individual are routed, American writing machines function within a configuration that includes a much wider range of storage and transmission media, not only typewriter, film, and sound recording but also television, computer, and the global communications aggregate usually referred to as the Net or the Web.  Necessarily, then, the writing machines that produce American fiction of information multiplicity are concerned not simply with other media but with their own mediality.” (Johnston 19)

desire no longer regulated by disciplinary structures (Foucault), but instead “dispersed throughout a corporate space of continuous modulation and variation without interruption and within which access to information (even simple cash machines) requires the insertion of special codes into global communications networks that are nowhere fully materialized” (Johnston 19) — shift from a disciplinary society to a society of control

word and image as viral, important not in that they mean, but in that they reproduce

Naked Lunch as body/text:  “The body is a certain kind of text, written by genetic and biologic codes, and the text is also formed of bodies (or words as viral bodies)” (Johnston 22)

mass media as “only the most visible result” of larger shifts in “both the form and material, and therefore the distribution and communication networks, of the exchange processes that define contemporary social and economic organizations” (Johnston 25)

D&G’s analysis of capitalism:  machinic enslavement v. social subjection; in cybernetic regime, both enslavement and subjection are incorporated, producing a society of control — see D&G on TV:  A Thousand Plateaus p. 458

“capitalism can function only because it is constantly  exceeding itself and producing more flow than it can possibly reclaim and recode, or recontain through the imposition of new codes” (Johnston 28) — information functions in similar manner to capitalist axiomatic

“the writing machines that generate the novel of information multiplicity define and are defined by the double movement of the information axiomatic: a machinic inscription of information, but one that in turn yields a multiplicity since the inscription itself causes more information to proliferate and brings the various sense of information into play, and both at once.” (Johnston 30)

2.  Information and Mediality:  The Novel as Psychic Apparatus

Daniel Dennett, Consciousness Explained:  consciousness not “stream of,” because not centralized, but instead in multiple channels — de-centered

information theory and cybernetics (see Shannon and Wiener) both define information in strictly machinic terms

Kittler:  consciousness as “the interiorized reflection of the current standards of technical media” (Johnston 33); if consciousness had to be redefined in terms of cinema in the early twentieth century, “today that insight must be expanded to include all technical media.” (Johnston 33)

COL49, information, entropy; Shannon and von Neumann argue that entropy and information are the same thing

modernist reading of COL49 raises epistemological uncertainty about which of the 4 options is true; postmodernist reading instead focuses on ontology, in which all 4 options are true, as 4 worlds simultaneously exist; “the simultaneous copresence of incompossible worlds arises from something inherent in the historically specific environment of California in the 1960s:  the omnipresence of communications media” (Johnston 44)

“It is not simply that the entire landscape, and Oedipa’s affective relationship to it, is always mediated by communications technology, although that is certainly true.  Rather, it is as if the spaces across which these communications transpire were haunted by invisible presences or powers that the novel as psychic apparatus can register but which cannot be integrated into an individual character’s meaningful ‘experience’.” (Johnston 45) — gap = Tristero

Niklas Luhmann: dissolve of subject into systems; modern society as self-referential systems; excluded others (like Tristero) as emergent sub-system

“if the uncanny moments in Oedipa’s experience are triggered by her recurrent failures to integrate perception and memory — such failures always occurring in spaces mediated by technological devices — why are they figured specifically by an underground postal system, and one that may even appear archaic in contrast to the technical media of the contemporary world?” (Johnston 48-49); Derrida, The Post Card

end of COL49 forces jump from hermeneutic to medial perspective; interpretation of meaning no longer useful; instead, must read effects of mediation

Derrida, “Freud and the Scene of Writing”:  structure of psychic apparatus represented by writing machine; “since psychic processes cannot be conceived apart from or exterior to a certain ‘scene of writing,’ technological devices can no longer serve as mere metaphors” (Johnston 53)

“the multiplicities that define and are defined by the contemporary novel of information multiplicity are predicated on the realization that language no longer enjoys a position of sovereignty but is now only one medium among many.” (Johnston 58) — yes, and yet this “realization” is not neutral for the postmodern novelist, who is still confined to that linguistic medium for his own production

Part II:  The Novel of Information Multiplicity

3.  Rocket-State Assemblage:  Gravity’s Rainbow

work of Turing, Wiener, von Neumann, Shannon, etc., undertaken “under the dark auspices of World War II and the ensuing Cold War” (Johnston 62) — government/military as primary support/instigator for scientific research “shredded and stripped away the illusion that science is apolitical” (Johnston 62)

GR: confirmed the sixties counterculture position that “paranoia no longer designated a mental disorder but rather a critical method of information retrieval” (Johnston 62)

Deleuzian distinction between author (who expresses or signifies with language) and writer (who invents assemblages from the assemblages that invented him) — Pynchon as writer in Deleuzian sense

striking parallel between Pynchon and D&G, especially Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus, on the relationship between capitalism and schizophrenia

“Putting into question relations of cause and effect, this enigmatic coincidence [of Slothrop’s map and the distribution of rocket-falls] brings under critical scrutiny a number of agencies and technologies by which Western culture attempts to define and control reality (most obviously:  through behaviorism, missile guidance systems, the cinema, and psychic communication with ‘the other side’).” (Johnston 66-67)

“the dominant impression or effect created by Pynchon’s use of film and the cinematic apparatus in Gravity’s Rainbow is to erode completely any possibility of a fixed or stable opposition between the world on film and the world unmediated by it.” (Johnston 76)

“The Zone itself figures as the crucible necessary for the meltdown and dissolution of outdated territories, languages, and filiations, of all boundaries, forms, and even human identities impeding the installation of a new order that will take cybernetics as the model in its remaking of the world as a pure instrumentality.” (Johnston 80) — but isn’t the critical desire to explore the represented world solely through these technologies assisting in the instrumentalization of the world, at the expense of human social identities, which persist even in the cybernetic age?

D&G’s four signifying regimes:  pre-signifying (primitive; mythological); signifying or semiotic (barbaric or despotic; paranoid); counter-signifying (nomadic, marginal; multiplicitous); post-signifying (modern; betrayal of semiotic and simultaneous doubling modes of subjectivity)

4.  Narration, Delirium, Machinic Consciousness:  Lookout Cartridge

Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene; Daniel Dennett, Consciousness Explained

potential Lacanian reading, via Kittler:  Kittler’s “insistence on the convergence of the ‘methodological distinctions of modern psychoanalysis and technical distinctions of the modern media landscape’ are therefore essential for understanding the significance of Lacanian theory as it might be applied to McElroy’s novel” (Johnston 119)

Jameson’s insistence that representations of networks figure multi-national capital ignores what McElroy sees:  “how our experience, and hence our awareness of contemporary events, cannot be assumed to exist apart from the technologies, scriptive and otherwise, by which those events are registered[;] but also how those technologies always extend experience beyond their intended end, and therefore beyond the ends for which those technologies were presumably designed.” (Johnston 121-122)

5.  Capitalism and Entropic Flow:  JR

Raymond Williams’ notions of television and “flow”

“This compulsion to make capital flow and circulate through every sector of human being and social life not only defines objects primarily in relation to their sign or information value but also calls for a new form of operational subject.  Such a subject functions not as a centered and autonomous agent, engaging other agents in a scene of dramatic action, but as a screen, interface, terminal, or switching node within multiple networks and relay systems.” (Johnston 126)

desiring-machines, “as Deleuze and Guattari call the coupling of an energy-producing machine or one that produces flow (of any material whatsoever) with another that breaks, cuts into, or siphons off part of that flow.” (Johnston 128)

Part III:  The Novel of Media Assemblages

6.  Fictions of the Culture Medium:  The Novels of Don DeLillo

DeLillo’s “use of genre as a framing device corresponds directly to the increased importance of the mass media” (Johnston 165)

“the difference between separable media and a syncretic medium produced by the mass media accounts for many of the most distinctive features of DeLillo’s writing” (Johnston 166)

evolution of the media assemblage across DeLillo’s novels is “marked by the way in which word and image, film and televisual effects are reconfigured as aspects of an englobing media assemblage, or multiplicity, within which the ‘de-multiplication’ of human identity and the collusion of agencies and institutions are the most striking consequences” (Johnston 168)

“What interests DeLillo the writer is not simply the influence of cinema and the image per se but a new mode of perception which might be called postcinematic, in that it assumes a totalizing omnipresence of cinema and hence the transformation of the world itself into a universe of interacting images.” (Johnston 173)

Deleuzian reading of cinema, in which “not only the world but also its perceivers can be defined as interacting images” (Johnston 173)

7.  An American Book of the Dead:  Media and Spectral Life in Vineland

“Rather than concentrating on the effects of this [culture] medium, it holds up for scrutiny how various media — particularly film, television, and computer — provide the basic terms in which the characters attempt to make sense of their lives.” (Johnston 206)

“The co-presence but lack of integration among these partially connected media systems goes a certain way toward explaining Vineland’s heterogeneity, its polyphony of voices and mixed universes of reference, its shifting topography of alternate worlds.  But it also accounts for the novel’s complex temporality and the multiple times that inhere in its ‘present’.  Since the time of information is not instantaneous (i.e., various incompatible media allow or require different rhythms of access), time is the issue not only of but also in Vineland’s narrative.” (Johnston 207)

“Vineland as a whole, however, doesn’t fully support Isaiah Two Four’s negative view of television and suggests that even tubal mindlessness can have its subversive appeal.”  (Johnston 210) — I think this misses the point; it’s not that Isaiah is negative about TV, but that Zoyd’s generation was naïve about it — Zoyd’s generation being that which has been displaced (obsolesced) by these newer technologies

D&G and decoding and recoding, with regard to television — not the Stuart Hall semantic sense:  “Because media harbor a potential for radical, schizophrenic deterritorialization, or flight, they can also operate as a powerful apparatus of social control.  Although both delivered and authorized by the media as a control network, or site where capitalism attempts to recode the flows it unleashes, the structures of meaning (redundancy) necessary for recoding and overcoding are never sufficient or complete.  Decoded flows (not just of capital, but of sounds, images, and texts) ceaselessly engender new flows that inevitably escape, providing take off points along lines of flight for the characters, however momentary and short-lasting.” (Johnston 228)

8.  The Disappearance of Media:  Cyberspace in Neuromancer

“what Gibson imagined in 1984 — the year of Neuromancer’s publication — actually points to a new becoming on the technological horizon:  a totalized, global information economy in which information and the digital ‘dance of biz’ do not simply extend capital and its logic of commodification (capital and information already being nearly indistinguishable) but effectuate a conjunction of human being and silicon.” (Johnston 233)

information has here lost its cognitive value; instead, it has only exchange value

simstim v. cyberspace:  “while simstim is passive and anodyne [read: feminine], a vicarious experience, cyberspace is interactive and dangerous [i.e., masculine], requiring the intense focus of a disembodied consciousness” (Johnston 240)

in Gibson, no longer dealing with separate media; in fact, with their final unification, media have disappeared
Coda.  “Change for the Machines”:  The Complexity of Bodies in Synners

“Even as it explores a near futuristic, high-tech world, however, Synners reasserts the importance of gender, the pain and difficulty of human relationships, the values of a circumambient if marginal community, and above all the emotional needs and claims of the desiring body.  This is not to suggest that, in contrast to Neuromancer, Synners brings back and re-centers the ‘properly’ human drama exiled behind the backdrop of high-tech surfaces and communication networks.  On the contrary, Synners can be said to push beyond Neuromancer precisely because it explores a wider range of forms of intelligence and will — benign and malignant, human and nonhuman — as they are directly imbricated in or respond to technological assemblages.” (Johnston 257-58)

“What Synners offers, then, is a continuum of subjectivities inseparable from but not reducible to the workings of a new technological assemblage.” (Johnston 265)
