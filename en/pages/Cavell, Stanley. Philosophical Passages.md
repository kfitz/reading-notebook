Preface

shifts in literary studies in last decades; not just expanding the canon to account for diversity of subject positions, but also to include philosophical, psychoanalytical, historical, and other texts previously treated as “background” — the “theoretical revolution” (viii)

“Many practicing writers and teachers of literature, however, see recent developments in literary theory as dangerous and anti-humanistic.  They would insist that displacement of centrality of the word, claims for the ‘death of the author,’ emphasis upon gaps and incapacities in language, and indiscriminate opening of the canon threaten to marginalize literature itself.” (viii)

Introduction (Michael Payne)

Cavell’s Voices and Derrida’s Grammatology

Cavell’s “What Did Derrida Want of Austin?” is response to Derrida’s “Signature Event Context”

John Searle, author of Speech Acts, responds to Derrida; brouhaha ensues

“Although Austin considers speech acts as communication, his distinction between constantive utterances (true or false descriptions of facts) and performative utterances (utterances that accomplish something through speech itself) opens up the category of communication to what is other than the transmission of thought-content.  Performative utterances do not have ‘outside’ referents; they rather transmit force, as Nietzsche seemed to anticipate.  Austin’s achievement then, in Derrida’s view, was to shatter the classical concept of communication, but he limited his argument too soon.  For performative utterances to be felicitous, they must occur within certain contextual conventions.  But Derrida points out that there are also intrinsic conventions to language; that the possibility of infelicity is inescapable; that what Austin calls parasitic in language excludes more than citation, which actually may be the sine qua non of performatives; that Austin excludes drama, poetry, and writing.  In order to fend off infelicity and parasitical utterances, Austin invokes present, conscious intention as a defining context.  To this, Derrida opposes his concept of différance the irreducible absence of intention which is inescapable in all language, even in the word communication.  Derrida concludes that Austin requires the source of the utterance as a continuing presence, or at least as secured by a signature.  But signatures are susceptible (as Derrida argues in Part Four) to the problems of all language:  absence, iterability, detachedness from their event, and independence of context.  Like all forms and structures, they invite deconstruction, or perform it in advance of being detected.” (8-9)

“What Did Derrida Want of Austin?”

encounters between Austin, Derrida, and Searle have “done more harm than good” in interactions between philosophy and literary studies (44)

impressions of Austin too ruled in literary circles by the few citations Derrida selected; “This has helped perpetuate the thought that Austin underwrites some idea that language contains a general, unified dimension of effect that can be called one of performance, and that he advances a general contrast between ordinary language and literary language.” (44-45)

Cavell’s original defense of Austin, “Must We Mean What We Say?” (1957)

Austin and Wittgenstein are original in their defense of the ordinary over against Continental philosophy’s obsession with metaphysics

Austin and Derrida both:  “1. share the object of dismantling the metaphysics of Western philosophy;
2. find philosophical procedures that are neither those of commentary nor of interpretation nor of refutation, but one of what Derrida calls going through texts; and specifically
3. going through exemplary texts, exemplary of their respective traditions, in order
4. to produce an exemplary text in response; and specifically one meant
5. to show how to think in the aftermath of some destruction of thinking.” (47-48)

“Given these intersections, I ask:  How is it that Derrida misses the extent of Austin’s differences from the classical and/or academic philosophers with whom Austin, as much as Derrida, is at odds?” (48)

Austin, like Derrida, is fighting logocentrism in How to Do Things with Words; demolishing the philosophical notion that statements are about knowledge of facts

Cavell finds a Nietzschean line in Austin, but a different one from that proposed by Derrida

“what Austin ‘substitutes’ at the place of a concept of truth is not force but ‘felicity.’ ” (51) — Austin as anti-positivist

“Misplacing the role of ‘force,’ Derrida takes the role of ‘felicity’ and ‘infelicity’ to be one of determining failures of language as external to language rather than as conditions of language’s possibility — an insight he thinks Austin misses.” (52)

“It seems to make no sense to say that deliberately superficial, witty, mocking Austin, would be inscribing the relation of his work on performative utterances to the realm of the tragic.” (53)

role of excuses in Austin’s view of human action; “To experience Austin’s meticulous journey through his world of concrete examples of these qualification — and scores of others — is momentarily to put aside all question of how we know such things, or whether to know them is philosophy.  Excuses betoken, we might say, the incessant, unending vulnerability of human action, its exposure to the independence of the world and the preoocupation of the mind.” (53)

“Excuses mark out the region of tragedy, mark it as the beyond of the excusable, the justifiable, the explainable, (the sociable?).” (54)

this tragic sense of the “unbearableness” (54) of human action is the connection to Nietzsche

Derrida’s second complaint about Austin is his refusal of the failures of language — but Austin considers this through the doctrine of insincerity

“…what it betokens about utterance or about action that they can suffer, say, imitation (to take that title for the iterative).  It betokens, roughly, that human utterances are essentially vulnerable to insincerity (you may say false consciousness) and that the realization that we may never know whether others are sincere or genuine (I do not exclude the first person) is apt to become unbearable.” (58)

problem, for Cavell, is Austin’s “rejection of the threat of skepticism” (58)

Austin and Wittgenstein “understand skepticism and metaphysics as forms of intellectual tragedy” (61)

Seminar on “What Did Derrida Want of Austin?”

nothing of relevance to Austin, particularly, except the rehash of the lecture
