Guillory, John. "How Scholars Read." ADE Bulletin 146 (Fall 2008): 8-17.


"The stubbornly empirical question of how fast scholars read is at the center of my concern here; from this question a host of other questions radiate outward, questions about the mutually determining relation between how scholars write and how scholars read. The mutual determination of writing and reading also bears directly on the history of academic publication, which is formed and deformed by the demand on scholars to publish their research." (9)

"it would be a mistake to identify scholarly modes of reading as simply the effect of new genres of scholarly writing. In fact, scholarship was of great interest to lay readers for much of the period between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries and was produced in styles of writing that solicited lay reading." (9)

"The most crucial as well as the most disputed argument concerning the history of lay reading was proposed by Rolf Engelsing in 1974 with reference to research he conducted in Germany and on which he based his famous distinction between 'intensive' and 'extensive' reading." (10)

"in fact the world of early modern reading retained too much of the character of earlier reading practices — even the practice of memorization — to fall on the near side of a hypothetical 'reading revolution,' defined by the emergence of extensive reading. It was only with the explosion of new print matter in the later eighteenth century, especially periodicals and novels, that reading was supposed to have definitively speeded up." (10)

"Guglielmo Cavallo and Roger Chartier argue in their introduction to *History of Reading in the West* that modes of intensive reading survived the so-called reading revolution of the later eighteenth century and that even novels were 'read and reread, memorized, cited and recited' (25)." (10)

"Engelsing’s distinction is crude but might be calibrated more precisely to define differences between reading practices specific to different forms of writing." (10)

"Literary scholars read novels intensively, though in a manner unlike that of earlier readers of scripture. Intensive reading in the scholarly context is defined by the practice of rereading, or, in the discipline’s favorite term of art, 'close reading.' Scholars may find that as a result of this procedure, they come to know certain texts or passages by heart, but memorization is rarely the intention of close reading." (11)

"The humanist’s 'extensive' reading rather entailed a special kind of attention. This activity — what we now call research — has its pleasures, to be sure, but these pleasures are not like those of novel reading, best indicated by the notion of the page-turner." (11)

"For the modern scholar, reading in the conduct of research can be pleasurable, but it might also be painful, intensive because laborious." (12)

"for this kind of text to become the object of study, the scholar must first, so to speak, alienate her or his own practice of lay reading by deliberately decelerating its rapid, or inattentive, pace. This is a complex process indeed, because it assumes that lay reading is the very condition of scholarly reading, that practice against which scholarly reading defines itself. For this reason scholarly reading can be said to preserve within it an encysted form of lay reading, a necessary recollection of the pleasure and rapidity of lay reading." (12)

"interpretation has now been relegated to the literary professoriat, and strongly resisted by the laity as an encroachment on the pleasure of its extensive reading. At the same time, scholarly reading is defined by the explicit exhibition of its interpretive reading, as writing and as publication." (12)

"That scholarship is read mainly by scholars is an expression of the same division of labor and differentiation of social spheres that characterizes modernity as such. The more problematic fact is that scholarship is not often read very enthusiastically or intensively by scholars themselves" (12)

"When we turn to the scholarly reading of scholarship, a new set of problems and questions arise. Here too we face the problem of a virtual infinity of texts and therefore the necessity of extensive reading. But whereas the archive seems to reward our cognitive limitations by allowing us to see something differently than it was seen before, the quantity of scholarly writing presses upon us with more ambiguous effect. In part, this is the result of an accumulation that now defies mastery and necessitates increasing specialization as a way of reducing the volume of scholarship one needs to read in order to assert mastery in a given field." (13)

"The best scholarship is often produced at the interface between self-limited mastery and the most far-fetched reading." (13)

"Much scholarship is read in a default mode that is distinct from scanning and can be called simply *skimming*, again a term we must borrow from common usage. This technique is not inherently objectionable; but if the recourse to skimming is a necessary response to the accumulation of scholarship, it also gestures toward the many works we have no time to read at all." (13)

"Scholarship might be said to propagate scholarship, by provoking response and further inquiry. But this generative principle does not entirely explain the accumulation of books that may be unread or read by very few." (14)

"The expansion of the postwar university was driven by investment in science, which entailed the reduction of teaching commitments for scientists to permit more time for research. In the interest of equity, university administrations extended this reduction to humanities professors. university administrations understood this reduction contractually, as the right to demand more publication from humanities professors in exchange for reduced teaching loads. Thus was born our current tenure and promotion system, which in most universities and many colleges demands more publication than in the previous history of American education." (14)

"Scholarly books are often read from the peripheral matter inward, from the table of contents, the index, the notes, the introduction and conclusion, then to the chapters themselves, some of which might be read closely, others scanned, others skipped altogether. Scholarly books are pulled apart like the Sunday paper." (14)

"The reality of how scholars read, however, raises the question of whether the writing of scholarship might be retroengineered from the endpoint of the reading situation. Such a transformation is already occurring with online venues, although without as yet any effect on the bureaucratic demand for the production of paper monographs. Let me hasten to say that I am not arguing here for the abolition of the scholarly book in favor of an electronic alternative. On the contrary, I would rather see a diverse system of scholarly publication that preserves as one of its possibilities the book that solicits an intensive reading, no matter how difficult its prose and no matter how long it happens to be. But that possibility is just what the tendency of academic publication is militating against." (14)

"Perhaps the greater harm in the proliferation of unread or casually read scholarship, however, is the devaluation of teaching, both as the means for transmission of long-standing knowledge and as the first venue for disseminating new knowledge. Would it perhaps be healthier in some ways if we scholars taught more and wrote less? When I have tendered this immodest proposal to colleagues, I have been greeted with the stunned silence reserved for the most intolerable social impropriety." (15)

"Those of us who teach graduate students know that the conceptualization of a dissertation project is constrained not by the imagination of the student but by the requisites of a job market that ruthlessly rejects scholarship that does not conform to current models of organization and address current topics." (15)
