Bolter, Jay David, and Grusin, Richard.  Remediation:  Understanding New Media.  Cambridge, Mass.:  MIT Press, 1999.

Introduction

the "double logic of remediation.  Our culture wants both to multiply its media and to erase all traces of mediation:  ideally, it wants to erase its media in the very act of multiplying them." (Bolter and Grusin 5) -- immediacy and hypermediacy

"Older electronic and print media are seeking to reaffirm their status within our culture as digital media challenge that status.  Both new and old media are invoking the twin logics of immediacy and hypermediacy in their efforts to remake themselves and each other." (Bolter and Grusin 5)

two logics are not merely contradictory but interdependent

"Our primary concern will be with visual technologies, such as computer graphics and the World Wide Web.  We will argue that these new media are doing exactly what their predecessors have done:  presenting themselves as refashioned and improved versions of other media.  Digital visual media can best be understood through the ways in which they honor, rival and revise linear-perspective painting, photography, film, television, and print.  No medium today, and certainly no single media event, seems to do its cultural work in isolation form other media, any more than it works in isolation from other social and economic forces.  What is new about new media comes from the particular ways in which they refashion older media and the ways in which older media refashion themselves to answer the challenges of new media."  (Bolter and Grusin 14-15)

Theory
1.  Immediacy, Hypermediacy, and Remediation

genealogy of two logics of remediation; not claiming them as universal aesthetic truths, but specific historical practices of specific groups

thus Foucauldian analysis, but less interested in relations of power than in "relations of cultural power and prestige" (Bolter and Grusin 21, fn1)

the logic of transparent immediacy: "The transparent interface is one more manifestation of the need to deny the mediated character of digital technology altogether.  To believe that with digital technology we have passed beyond mediation is also to assert the uniqueness of our present technological moment."  (Bolter and Grusin 24)

examination of the ways that techniques like perspective, erasure, and automaticity attempt to create immediacy in painting, photography, film, and television

"Computer programs may ultimately be human products, in the sense that they embody algorithms devised by human programmers, but once the program is written and loaded, the machine can operate without human intervention.  Programming, then, employs erasure or effacement" (Bolter and Grusin 27)

the logic of hypermediacy: windowed style of interface

logic of immediacy has been dominant since Renaissance; in modernism, hypermediacy moves to forefront -- technology now seen as "second nature"; transparency now contradicts authenticity

remediation: the presentation of one medium in another; a defining characteristic of new digital media

because of remediation, print will not die in the digital age:  "The very act of remediation… ensures that the older medium cannot be entirely effaced; the new medium remains dependent on the older one in acknowledged or unacknowledged ways." (Bolter and Grusin 47)

tv and WWW are "engaged in an unacknowledged competition in which each now seeks to remediate the other" (Bolter and Grusin 47-48)

remediation is not a transitional step, as Holtzman argues about repurposing, but rather a constant dialectic

2.  Mediation and Remediation

"Hypermedia and transparent media are opposite manifestations of the same desire:  the desire to get past the limits of representation and to achieve the real." (Bolter and Grusin 53) -- the real is here not a metaphysical real but rather the real of the viewer's experience

remediation can function in different ways:  as the mediation of mediation; as the inseparability of mediation and reality; as reform

"Postmodern theory errs in trying to isolate language as a cultural force, for it fails to appreciate how language interacts with other media, other technologies, and other cultural artifacts." (Bolter and Grusin 57)

"Newer media do not necessarily supersede older media because the process of reform and refashioning is mutual." (Bolter and Grusin 59, fn. 9)

"Each new medium is justified because it fills a lack or repairs a fault in its predecessor, because it fulfills the unkept promise of an older medium.  (Typically, of course, users did not realize that the older medium had failed in its promise until the new one appeared.)" (Bolter and Grusin 60)

3.  Networks of Remediation

what is a medium?  "a medium is that which remediates." (Bolter and Grusin 65)

remediation has material, economic, social, and technological dimensions, which cannot be considered separately

remediation & Benjamin:  not the naïve optimism of Rheingold & Barlow; complex dynamic of immediacy (the removal of aura) and hypermediacy (the visibility of the machine)

"The work of art today seems to offer ‘an aspect of reality which cannot be freed from mediation or remediation,' at the same time that new media seek to present us precisely with ‘an aspect of reality which is free from all mediation.'  Thus remediation does not destroy the aura of a work of art; instead it always refashions that aura in another media form." (Bolter and Grusin 75)

technological determinism: see argument between Williams & McLuhan

the remediation of the gendered gaze:  Durer woodcut "suggests the possibility that technologies of transparent immediacy based on linear perspective, such as perspective painting, photography, and film, or computer graphics and virtual reality, may all be enacting the so-called male gaze, excluding women from full participation as subjects and maintaining them as objects." (Bolter and Grusin 79)

psychosexual reading of immediacy/hypermediacy -- linear (i.e. straight) v. polymorphous(ly perverse)

Media
4.  Computer Games

computer games as a remediation of computing power; visually complex games also remediate film and television

Myst's allegory remediates the book:  "the book as a text should be replaced by the book as a window onto a visually realized world" (Bolter and Grusin 96) -- player who "loses" is trapped in book

pornography as one of first uses of new media forms

5.  Digital Photography

"At first, then, there seems to be a simple dichotomy:  digital photography is hypermediated, while analog photography is transparent.  Digital photography appears to complicate and even to mock the desire for immediacy that traditional photography promises to satisfy.  On the other hand, because a digital photograph can sometimes be regarded as transparent, it too can express our desire for immediacy." (Bolter and Grusin 111)

6.  Photorealistic Graphics

7.  Digital Art

digital art often photorealistic in style, but fantastic in content

use of allegory in digital art; "remediation through parody" (Bolter and Grusin 142)

electronic art v. computer art

8.  Film

in Toy Story, computer graphics remediate film, but film also remediates computer graphics

in the Hollywood style, transparency is the status quo; "hypermediacy is equated with dreams, mental disorder, or insanity" (Bolter and Grusin 152); experimental or avant-garde film has always been hypermediated

9.  Virtual Reality

VR as clearest example of transparent immediacy; "the medium that best expresses the contemporary definition of the self as a roving point of view" (Bolter and Grusin 161); cultural metaphor for the ideal of perfect mediation

AI (computer as symbol manipulator) replaced by VR (computer as graphics engine)

VR as remediation of the subjective style of film

10.  Mediated Spaces

Disney and the remediation of the amusement park; Disneyland as the ground on which film and television could meet

the city as mediated space; malls as repurposed television, celebrating hypermediacy

nonplaces -- places that are pure mediation (malls, waiting areas, etc.)

cyberspace as nonplace:  "Cyberspace is a shopping mall in the ether" (Bolter and Grusin 179)

the theology of cyberspace leads to utopian descriptions that ignore the material limitations; rejection of material world and human body

11.  Television

primary target of remediation is film; tv has always been open about mediation, but nonetheless has immediate styles (reality programming)

hypermediacy in news programming (windowed style of CNN)

television's remediation of the real

12.  The World Wide Web

ability to transmit graphics created large web audience; also allowed web to refashion larger group of older media forms

web's archival function:  "Perhaps developers of these web sites and our popular culture at large are inclined to be respectful precisely because these media are regarded as played out and therefore not likely to threaten the new digital media." (Bolter and Grusin 201-202)

web apps refashion newer perceptual media (radio, tv, telephone) more aggressively than older forms; hypermediacy dominates

13.  Ubiquitous Computing

telepresence; augmented reality

"Where virtual reality invites the user to become part of a world beyond mediation, ubiquitous computing offers the user a world in which everything is a medium, because everything is or contains a computing device." (Bolter and Grusin 217)

14.  Convergence

"Convergence is remediation under another name, and the remediation is mutual:  the Internet refashions television even as television refashions the Internet." (Bolter and Grusin 224)

Self
15.  The Remediated Self

we see ourselves in media -- "This is not to say that our identity is fully determined by media, but rather that we employ media as vehicles for defining both personal and cultural identity." (Bolter and Grusin 231)

two versions of contemporary mediated self:  "When we are faced with media that operate primarily under the logic of transparent immediacy…, we see ourselves as a point of view immersed in an apparently seamless visual environment…. At the same time, the logic of hypermediacy…suggests a definition of self whose key quality is not so much ‘being immersed' as ‘being interrelated or connected.' " (Bolter and Grusin 232)

two visions of the self as complementary rather than contradictory -- both assume the authentic self can be achieved through media

William James and the "empirical self"; sum of material, social, spiritual

hypermediated self becomes necessary because true immediacy is impossible

desire for immediacy as male desire?  denial of mediation as denial of body; recent feminist theory (Haraway, Balsamo, Stone, etc.) insists on embodiment of self and complex relationship between body and technology

16.  The Virtual Self

virtual adoption of alternate points of view as training for liberal empathy

does VR tend toward disembodiment and thus reinforce the Cartesian dualism, or is it anti-Cartesian in its attempts to relocate the body? Both.

"Those who insist that the body plays an undeniable part in the definition of the contemporary self should be prepared to recognize the mediations of the body that must also be part of that definition." (Bolter and Grusin 254)

17.  The Networked Self

MUD participants clear about their mediated status

gender simultaneously erased and inscribed

18.  Conclusion

endless enthusiasm in West for new media developments; apparently "a medium must be new in order to be significant" (Bolter and Grusin 270); all new developments must be revolutions, but all are in fact remediations
