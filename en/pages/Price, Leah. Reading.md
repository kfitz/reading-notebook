on the solitary and impenetrable nature of book-reading: "What's 'alien' here is not simply the relation of readers to illiterates (human or canine), but also one reader's relation to another." (Price 304)

"For all the polemics that have shaped the field -- about extensive reading, about technological determinism, about whether to determine the texts read by a particular demographic group or to define the audience reached by an individual text -- historians seem united in the urge to contest James's characterization of reading as a literally 'senseless' act." (Price 304)

"different scholars have understood the term to encompass enterprises as various as the social history of education, the quantitative study of the distribution of printed matter, and the reception of texts or diffusion of ideas. Reading means something different to literary critics (for whom it tends to feed either into case studies focused on the reception of particular texts or into theories of hermeneutics) than to historians (for whom it can become a subset of social or intellectual history)." (Price 304)

"A critic as eminent as Tzvetan Todorov, for example, still cavalierly substitutes inscribed readers for empirical audiences, complaining (one hopes tongue in cheek) that 'One of the difficulties in studying reading is due to the fact that reading is so hard to observe: introspection is uncertain, psycho-sociological investigation is tedious. It is therefore with a kind of relief that we find the work of construction represented in fiction itself, a much more convenient place for study.'" (Price 305, quoting Todorov, "Reading as Construction" 78-79)

"Elizabeth Long’s unabashedly populist chapter, 'Textual Interpretation as Collective Action,' uses an analysis of contemporary reading groups to counterbalance the traditional trope of solitary reading. Empirical studies of mid-twentieth-century American adults have shown that reading correlates with social involvement: readers need others to set an example, to provide a sounding board for reactions to texts, to recommend and criticize and exchange books. Long's emphasis on the influence of oral and communal interactions on what's been imagined for several centuries as a silent and solitary activity thus inverts Natalie Davis's exhortation for critics to 'consider a printed book not merely a source for ideas and images, but a carrier of relationships.'" (Price 306, quoting Davis, _Society and Culture in Early Modern France_ 192)

"Where 'circulation' was once a metaphor for the transmission of ideas, recent books by James Raven, Priya Joshi, and Franco Moretti have conspired to remind us just how literally books circulate in space." (Price 308)

"Throughout we can see the places of reading change, from the open spaces of antiquity (gardens, porticoes, squares, streets) to the closed sites of the Middle Ages (churches, monks' cells, refectories, courts). But reading practices reshape those spaces in turn: silent reading carved out privacy within communal institutions such as the coffee shop, the public library, and the railway carriage. (Which of us has not used a newspaper, or a copy of _Book History_, as a shield?)" (Price 309-10)

"Social, but also sociable. David Henkin's _City Reading: Written Words and Public Spaces in Antebellum New York_ (Columbia University Press, 1998) deploys 'unobtrusive street signs, imposing commercial advertisements, incendiary political broadsides' as emblems of how little of the world's reading actually takes place in private. As Henkin points out, our own association of reading with privacy feeds into 'a cluster of myths, some of which romanticize the written word, others of which romanticize a preliterate world of oral communication'." (Price 310, quoting Henkin x, 6)

"Within literary criticism proper, the reception theory that flourished in the German-speaking world in the 1970s shifted the making of meaning from authors to readers; so did Stanley Fish’s interest in 'communities' that determine (or at least allow us to predict) readers' responses—but also, just as important, in the unfolding of a single reader’s response through time. Fish’s innovation was not simply to replace the author with the reader as a maker of meaning, but also, more subtly, to substitute a temporal act (reading) for a spatial object (the text)." (Price 310) -- this seems to me super-important, esp. for thinking about commentpress's interventions into digital publishing; it temporalizes the process of interacting with a text...

"Indeed, some of the most interesting recent work on nineteenth-century American women's reading -- that of Barbara Hochman and Mary Kelley, for example -- has stressed precisely the impossibility of separating individual reading practices from literary communities." (Price 314)

"The received wisdom has been replaced by received skepticism: literacy is not a single phenomenon that can be studied across different cultures; it does not in itself cause social progress or economic growth, or (at an individual level) social mobility or rationality; 'literates do not necessarily think differently from illiterates, and no Great Divide separates societies with writing from those without it.'" (Price 316, quoting Bowman and Woolf, "Literacy and Power in the Ancient World" 2-3)

"Peter Stallybrass's recent work on how early modern readers navigated the codex -- a history of reading encapsulated by the bookmark -- brings exotic gestures close to home. Redefining the book from a container of meaning to an occasion for operations both mental and manual, his analysis shows the intellectual implications of physical forms..." (Price 318, referring to Stallybrass, "Books and Scrolls: Navigating the Bible," in _Books and Readers in Early Modern England_, ed. Jennifer Andersen and Elizabeth Sauer [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002], 42–79)
