I.  The End

"It is not expected of critics as it is of poets that they should help us to make sense of our lives; they are bound only to attempt the lesser feat of making sense of the ways we try to make sense of our lives" (Kermode 3)

"I shall be talking not only about the persistence of fictions but about their truth, and also about their decay.  There is the question, also, of our growing suspicious of fictions in general.  But it seems that we still need them.  Our poverty -- to borrow that rich concept from Wallace Stevens -- is great enough, in a world which is not our own, to necessitate a continuous preoccupation with the current fiction" (Kermode 4)

"I shall begin by discussing fictions of the End -- about ways in which, under varying existential pressures, we have imagined the ends of the world.  This, I take it, will provide clues to the ways in which fictions, whose ends are consonant with origins, and in concord, however unexpected, with their precedents, satisfy our needs.  So we begin with Apocalypse, which ends, transforms, and in concordant" (Kermode 5)

"Broadly speaking, apocalyptic thought belongs to rectilinear rather than cyclical views of the world, though this is not a sharp distinction" (Kermode 5)

"In their general character our fictions have certainly moved away from the simplicity of the paradigm; they have become more 'open.'  But they still have, and so far as one is capable of prediction must continue to have, a real relation to simpler fictions about the world.  Apocalypse is a radical instance of such fictions and a source of others" (Kermode 6)

"Men, like poets, rush 'into the middest,' *in medias res*, when they are born; they also die *in mediis rebus*, and to make sense of their span they need fictive concords with origins and ends, such as give meaning to lives and to poems.  The End they imagine will reflect their irreducibly intermediate preoccupations.  They fear it, and as far as we can see have always done so; the End is a figure for their own deaths.  (So, perhaps, are all ends in fiction, even if represented, as they are for example by Kenneth Burke, as cathartic discharges)" (Kermode 7)

"what human need can be more profound than to humanize the common death?  When we survive, we make little images of moments which have seemed like ends; we thrive on epochs" (Kermode 7)

"We project ourselves -- a small, humble elect, perhaps -- past the End, so as to see the structure whole, a thing we cannot do from our spot of time in the middle" (Kermode 8)

"We may be sure that we can from our special point of vantage work out the divisions of history in accordance with these figures [from Revelations], and that we must be right, if only because the state of the world shows so clearly that the second coming is at hand, *donec finiatur mundus corruptionis*.  The great majority of interpretations of Apocalypse assume that the End is pretty near.  Consequently the historical allegory is always having to be revised; time discredits it.  And this is important.  Apocalypse can be disconfirmed without being discredited" (Kermode 8)

"The Terrors and Decadence are two of the recurring elements in the apocalyptic pattern; Decadence is usually associated with the hope of renovation" (Kermode 9)

"In fact the mythology of Empire and of Apocalypse are very closely related" (Kermode 10)

"Focillon's treatment of the year 1000 reflects his interest in the way not only the millennium but the century and other fundamentally arbitrary chronological divisions -- we might simply call them *saecula* -- are made to bear the weight of our anxieties and hopes; they are, as he remarks, 'intemporal,' but we project them onto history, making it 'a perpetual calendar of human anxiety'" (Kermode 11)

"the myth, if we can call it that, of Transition.  Before the End there is a period which does not properly belong either to the End or to the *saeculum* preceding it.  It has its own characteristics.  This period of Transition seems not to have been defined until the end of the twelfth century; but the definition then arrived at -- by Joachim of Flora -- has proved to be remarkably enduring" (Kermode 12)

"the ideology of National Socialism incorporated Joachite elements; 'the Third Reich' is itself a Joachite expression.  And the notion of an End-dominated age of transition has passed into our consciousness, and modified our attitudes toward historical pattern" (Kermode 13-14)

the "indifference to disconfirmation" on the part of those who predict apocalypse studied by Festinger (Kermode 16); "for most of the members of the sect disconfirmation was quickly followed by the invention of new end-fictions and new calculations.  Festinger had previously noted that such sects characteristically sought to restore the pattern of prophecy rather than to abandon it, and on this erects a general doctrine, very interesting in the present connection, of what he calls *consonance*" (Kermode 17)

"Men in the middest make considerable imaginative investments in coherent patters which, by the provision of an end, make possible a satisfying consonance with the origins and with the middle.  That is why the image of the end can never be *permanently* falsified" (Kermode 17)

"This has relevance to literary plots, images of the grand temporal consonance" (Kermode 17)

"The story that proceeded very simply to its obviously predestined end would be nearer myth than novel or drama.  Peripeteia, which has been called the equivalent, in narrative, of irony in rhetoric, is present in every story of the least structural sophistication.  Now peripeteia depends on our confidence of the end; it is a disconfirmation followed by a consonance" (Kermode 18)

"The more daring the peripeteia, the more we may feel that the work reflects our sense of reality; and the more certainly we shall feel that the fiction under consideration is one of those which, by upsetting the ordinary balance of our naive expectations, is finding something out for us, something *real*" (Kermode 18)

on Robbe-Grillet:  "He refuses to speak of his 'theory' of the novel; it is the old ones who talk about the need for plot, character, and so forth, who have the theories.  And without them one can achieve a new realism.... The new novel 'repeats itself, bisects itself, modifies itself, contradicts itself, without even accumulating enough bulk to constitute a past -- and thus a "story," in the traditional sense of the word'" (Kermode 19)

"We cannot, of course, be denied an end; it is one of the great charms of books that they have to end.  But unless we are extremely naive, as some apocalyptic sects still are, we do not ask that they progress towards that end precisely as we have been given to believe.  In fact we should expect only the most trivial work to conform to pre-existent types" (Kermode 23-24)

early Christians "abolished history in favour of eschatology; but it was a premature abolition" (Kermode 25)

"No longer imminent, the End is immanent.  So that it is not merely the remnant of time that has eschatological import; the whole of history, and the progress of the individual life, have it also, as a benefaction from the End, now immanent.  History and eschatology, as Collingwood observed, are then the same thing" (Kermode 25)

"apocalypse, which included and superceded prophecy, was itself to be included in tragedy; and tragedy lost its height and stateliness when the single unritualized death became the sole point of reference" (Kermode 25-26)

"Karl Popper, in a biting phrase, once called historicism the 'substitution of historical prophecy for conscience.'  But of modern eschatology one can say that it has done exactly the opposite, and substituted conscience, or something subtler, for historical prophecy" (Kermode 26)

"Death and election are individual matters and became so early enough in the story.  The disconfirmation of the primary eschatological predication threw the emphasis on personal death as well as on to the sacraments; it has been said that Christianity of all the great religions is the most anxious, is the one which has laid the most emphasis on the terror of death" (Kermode 27)

"The Joachite 'transition' is the historical ancestor of modern crisis; in so far as we claim to live now in a period of perpetual transition we have merely elevated the interstitial period into an 'age' or *saeculum* in its own right, and the age of perpetual transition in technological and artistic matters is understandably an age of perpetual crisis in morals and politics" (Kermode 28)

"The apocalyptic types -- empire, decadence and renovation, progress and catastrophe -- are fed by history and underlie our ways of making sense of the world from where we stand, in the middest. / But the more learned the cleric, whether theologian, poet, or novelist, the 'higher' the kind he practises, the more subtly are these types overlaid" (Kermode 29-30)

"the End itself, in modern literary plotting loses its downbeat, tonic-and-dominant finality, and we think of it, as the theologians think of Apocalypse, as immanent rather than imminent.  Thus, as we shall see, we think in terms of crisis rather than temporal ends; and make much of subtle disconfirmation and elaborate peripeteia" (Kermode 30)

"the artifice of eternity exists only for the dying generations; and since they choose, alter the shape of time, and die, the eternal artifice must change.  The golden bird will not always sing the same song, though a primeval pattern underlies its notes" (Kermode 31)


II.  Fictions

"there have been great changes, especially in recent times when our attitudes to fiction in general have grown so sophisticated; although it seems, at the same time, that in 'making sense' of the world we still feel a need, harder than ever to satisfy because of an accumulated scepticism, to experience that concordance of beginning, middle, and end which is the essence of our explanatory fictions, and especially when they belong to cultural traditions which treat historical time as primarily rectilinear rather than cyclic" (Kermode 35-36)

"If we think first of modern fictions, it can hardly be an accident that ever since Nietzsche generalized and developed the Kantian insights, literature has increasingly asserted its right to an arbitrary and private choice of fictional norms, just as historiography has become a discipline more devious and dubious because of our recognition that its methods depend to an unsuspected degree on myths and fictions" (Kermode 36)

"If literary fictions *are* related to all others, then it must be said that they have some dangerous relations" (Kermode 37); one who argues, as did Nietzsche, that the falsity of opinions does not matter, if they are "life-furthering," "may be encouraging people who hold the fictive view that death on a large scale is life-furthering and species-preserving" (Kermode 37)

"Hannah Arendt, who has written with clarity and passion on this issue, argues that the philosophical or anti-philosophical assumptions of the Nazis were not generically different from those of the scientist, or indeed of any of us in an age 'where man, wherever he goes, encounters only himself'" (Kermode 38)

"I think we have to admit that the consciously false apocalypse of the Third Reich and the consciously false apocalypse of _King Lear_ imply equally a recognition that it is ourselves we are encountering whenever we invent fictions.  There may even be a real relation between certain kinds of effectiveness in literature and totalitarianism in politics.  But although the fictions are alike ways of finding out about the human world, anti-Semitism is a fiction of escape which tells you nothing about death but projects it onto others; whereas _King Lear_ is a fiction that inescapably involves an encouter with oneself, and the image of one's end" (Kermode 38-39)

"Fictions can degenerate into myths whenever they are not consciously held to be fictive" (Kermode 39)

"Myth operates within the diagrams of ritual, which presupposes total and adequate explanations of things as they are and were; it is a sequence of radically unchangeable gestures.  Fictions are for finding things out, and they change as the needs of sense-making change.  Myths are the agents of stability, fictions the agents of change.  Myths call for absolute, fictions for conditional assent" (Kermode 39)

"So my suggestion is that literary fictions belong to Vaihinger's category of 'the consciously false.'  They are not subject, like hypotheses, to proof or disconfirmation, only, if they come to lose their operational effectiveness, to neglect" (Kermode 40)

"If we forget that fictions are fictive we regress to myth (as when the Not-Platonists forgot the fictiveness of Plato's fictions and Professor Frye forgets the fictiveness of *all* fictions)" (Kermode 41)

"What Vaihinger calls 'reunion with reality' and I call 'making sense' or 'making human sense' is something that literature acheives only so long as we remember the status of fictions.  They are not myths, and they are not hypotheses; you neither rearrange the world to suit them, nor test them by experiment, for instance in gas-chambers" (Kermode 41)

"World history, the imposition of a plot on time, is a substitute for myth, and the substitution of an anti-historicist criticism for it is another step in the direction of harder satisfactions, in the clerkly rejection of romantic tenements.  There is no history, says Karl Popper, only histories; an insight in which he was anticipated by novelists" (Kermode 43)

"The decline of paradigmatic history, and our growing consciousness of historiography's irreducible element of fiction, are, like the sophistication of literary plotting, contributions to what Wilde called 'the decay of lying'" (Kermode 43)

"At some very low level, we all share certain fictions about time, and they testify to the continuity of what is called human nature, however conscious some, as against others, may become of the fictive quality of these fictions" (Kermode 44)

"The clock's *tick-tock* I take to be a model of what we call a plot, an organization that humanizes time by giving it form; and the interval between *tock* and *tick* represents purely successive, disorganized time of the sort that we need to humanize.  Later I shall be asking whether, when *tick-tock* seems altogether too easily fictional, we do not produce plots containing a good deal of *tock-tick*; such a plot is that of _Ulysses_" (Kermode 45)

"All such plotting presupposes and requires that an end will bestow upon the whole duration and meaning.  To put it another way, the interval must be purged of simple chronicity, of the emptiness of *tock-tick*, humanly uninteresting successiveness.  It is required to be a significant season, *kairos* poised between beginning and end" (Kermode 46)

"Within this organization that which was conceived of as simply successive becomes charged with past and future:  what was *chronos* becomes *kairos*" (Kermode 46)

"Tillich uses *kairos* idiosyncratically, but basically he means by it 'moment of crisis,' or, more obscurely, 'the fate of time'; in any case he has firmly associated it with a specifically modern sense of living in an epoch when 'the foundations of life quake beneath our feet'" (Kermode 47)

"*chronos* is 'passing time' or 'waiting time' -- that which, according to Revelation, 'shall be no more' -- and *kairos* is the season, a point in time filled with significance, charged with a meaning derived from its relation to the end" (Kermode 47)

"Not only the Greeks but also the Hebrews lacked this antithesis; for Hebrew, according to Marsh, had no word for *chronos*, and so no contrast between time which is simply 'one damn thing after another' and time as concentrated in *kairoi*.  It is the New Testament that lays the foundation for both the modern sense of epoch" (Kermode 47-48)

"Even if their lexical methods are faulty, it is important that these modern theologians *want* these words to mean involved distinctions of the sort I have discussed.  They play, as Wittgenstein might have said, and make up the rules as they go along.  These rules are attractive; and they are so because we need, for our obscure cultural ends, to observe distinctions between mere chronicity and times which are concordant and full" (Kermode 49-50)

"Normally we associate 'reality' with *chronos*, and a fiction which entirely ignored this association we might think unserious or silly or mad; only the unconscious is intemporal, and the illusion that the world can be made to satisfy the unconscious is an illusion without a future. // Yet in every plot there is an escape from chronicity, and so, in some measure, a deviation from this norm of 'reality'" (Kermode 50)
 
"any novel, however 'realistic,' involves some degree of alienation from 'reality'" (Kermode 50)

"One implication of this argument is that the 'virtual' time of books -- to use Mrs. Langer's word -- is a kind of man-centred model of world-time.  And books are indeed world-models.  St. Augustine found that the best model he could find for our experience of past, present, and future was the recitation of a psalm.  Thus he anticipated all the modern critics who wonder how it can be that a book can simultaneously be present like a picture (though in a way a picture has also to be recited) and yet extended in time" (Kermode 52)

"Gombrich's argument is that we ignore these facts when we make a sharp *a priori* distinction between time and space; that in time our minds work in fashions that are not wholly and simply successive, while in spatial appreciations -- as when one looks at a painting -- there is a temporal element; one 'scans' the picture and could not do so without retinal persistence; one remembers what has passed, and has expectations about what is to come" (Kermode 53-54)

"So we may call books fictive models of the temporal world.  They will be humanly serviceable as models only if they pay adequate respect to what we think of as 'real' time, the chronicity of the waking moment" (Kermode 54)

"But of course temporal realism, and also the high organization of the *tick-tock* interval, belong to the modern novel, not to Homer or Greek romance or Elizabethan drama before Shakespeare.  The history of the novel shows an increasing attention to such organization, and to the balance of regressive pleasure and the sense of reality.  In other words, because the form requires that the realism of the ego, and the desires of the lower mind, be simultaneously satisfied, the novel has to modify the paradigms -- organize extensive middles in concordance with remote origins and predictable ends -- in such a way as to preserve its difference from dreaming or other fantasy gratifications" (Kermode 55-56)

"History, so considered, is a fictive substitute for authority and tradition, a maker of concords between past, present, and future, a provider of significance to mere chronicity.  Everything is relevant if its relevance can be invented, even the scattered informations of the morning newspaper.  The novel imitates historiography in this:  anything can take its important place in the concord, a beerpull in a Joycean pub, a long-legged Indian wasp.  The merely successive character of events has been exorcised; the synthesizing consciousness has done its work" (Kermode 56)

"It is characteristic of the stage we are now at, I think, that the question of how far this submission ought to go -- or, to put it the other way, how far one may cultivate fictional patterns or paradigms -- is one which is debated, under various forms, by existentialist philosophers, by novelists and anti-novelists, by all who condemn the myths of historiography.  It is a debate of fundamental interest, I think, and I shall discuss it in my fifth talk. // Certainly, it seems, there must, even when we have achieved a modern degree of clerical scepticism, be some submission to the fictive patterns.  For one thing, a systematic submission of this kind is almost another way of describing what we call 'form'" (Kermode 57)
 
"Biology and cultural adaptation require it; the End is a fact of life and a fact and a fact of the imagination, working out from the middle, the human crisis.  As the theologians say, we 'live from the End,' even if the world should be endless.  We need ends and *kairoi* and the *pleroma*, even now when the history of the world has so terribly and so untidily expanded its endless successiveness.  We re-create the horizons we have abolished, the structures that have collapsed; and we do so in terms of the old patterns, adapting them to our new worlds.  Ends, for example, become a matter of images, figures for what does not exist except humanly.  Our stories must recognize mere successiveness but not be merely successive" (Kermode 58)

"The show of satisfaction will only serve when there seems to be a degree of real compliance with reality as we, from time to time, imagine it" (Kermode 63)

"Our ways of filling the interval between the *tick* and *tock* must grow more difficult and more self-critical, as well as more various; the need we continue to feel is a need of concern, and we supply it by increasingly varied concord-fictions.  They change as the reality from which we, in the middest, seek a show of satisfactin, changes; because 'times change.'  The fictions by which we seek to find 'what will suffice' change also.  They change because we no longer live in a world with an historical *tick* which will certainly be consummated by a definitive *tock*" (Kermode 63-64)

"It is also why literary fictions die, lose their explanatory force; and why fictions which do not change never even begin to live but sink into myths and satisfy nobody but critics who lack the critic's first qualification, a scepticism, an interest in things as they are, in inhuman reality as well as in human justice" (Kermode 64)


III.  World Without End or Beginning

"It is worth remembering that the rise of what we call literary fiction happened at a time when the revealed, authenticated account of the beginning was losing its authority" (Kermode 67)

"There was a long-established opinion that the beginning was as described in Genesis, and that the end is to be as obscurely predicted in Revelation.  But what if this came to seem doubtful?  Supposing reason proved capable of a quite different account of the matter, an account contradicting that of faith?" (Kermode 67)

"The concept of *aevum* provides a way of talking about this unusual variety of duration -- neither temporal nor eternal, but, as Aquinas said, participating in both the temporal and the etermal.  It does not abolish time or spatialize it; it co-exists with time, and is a mode in which things can be perpetual without being eternal" (Kermode 72)

"*Aevum*, you might say, is the time-order of novels.  Characters in novels are independent of time and succession, but may and usually do seem to operate in time and succession; the *aevum* co-exists with temporal events at the moment of occurrence, being, it was said, like a stick in the river" (Kermode 72)

"If the world was not eternal -- and the thesis had been condemned more than once -- there was nevertheless quite recognizably a sort of immortality, a perpetuity, in certain aspects of life.  The fiction which provided a duration for angels, and later for the Platonic Ideas, which were also by some held to reside in the *aevum*, was brought down to earth and used to reconcile certain discordant observations concerning human life" (Kermode 73)

"Now one of the differences between doing philsophy and writing poetry is that in the former activity you defeat your object if you imitate the confusion inherent in an unsystematic view of your subject, whereas in the second you must in some measure imitate what is extreme and scattering bright, or else lose touch with that feeling of bright confusion" (Kermode 80-81)

"This is the tragedy of sempiternity; apocalypse is translated out of time into the *aevum*.  The world may, as Gloucester supposed, exhibit all the symptoms of decay and change, all the terrors of an approaching end, but when the end comes it is not an end, and both suffering and the need for patience are perpetual" (Kermode 82)

"Macbeth is saying that if an act could be without succession, without temporal consequence, one would welcome it out of a possible future into actuality; it would be like having *hurly* without *burly*.  But acts without 'success' are a property of the *aevum*.  Nothing in time can, in that sense be \*done, freed of consequence or equivocal aspects" (Kermode 86)

"What, then, can Shakespearean tragedy, on this brief view, tell us about human time in an eternal world?  It offers imagery of crisis, of futures equivocally offered, by prediction and by action, as actualities; as a confrontation of human time with other orders, and the disastrous attempt to impose limited designs upon the time of the world" (Kermode 88)

"The concords of past, present, and future towards which the soul extends itself are out of time, and belong to the duration which was invented for angels when it seemed difficult to deny that the world in which men suffer their ends is dissonant in being eternal.  To close that great gap we use fictions of complementarity.  They may now be novels or philosophical poems, as they once were tragedies, and before that, angels" (Kermode 89)


IV.  The Modern Apocalypse

"there must be a link between the forms of literature and other ways in which, to quote Eric Auerbach, 'we try to give some kind of order and design to the past, the present, and the future.'  One of these ways is crisis" (Kermode 93)

"It seems doubtful that our crisis, our relation to the future and to the past, is one of the important differences between us and our predecessors.  Many of them felt as we do.  If the evidence looks good to us, so it did to them.  Perhaps if we have a terrible privilege it is merely that we are alive and are going to die, all at once or one at a time" (Kermode 95)

"The moments we call crises are ends and beginnings" (Kermode 96)

"I suppose for most of us the best known outbreak of *fin de siècle* phenomena occurred at the end of the nineteenth century; at any rate, it was in that century that the expression became current.  Certainly there was a great deal of apocalyptic feeling at that time, not least in the revival of imperial mythologies both in England and Germany, in the 'decadence' which became a literary category, and which produced Nordau's book ('it is as though the morrow could not link itself with today.  Things as they are totter and plunge'), in the utopian renovationism of some political sects and the anarchism of others.  This large and interesting subject we must here forego, except to maintain that the whole occurrence of *fin de siècle* phenomena amply illustrates Focillon's thesis, that we project our existential anxieties on to history" (Kermode 96-97) -- see Pynchon, V.

"The mood of *fin de siècle* is confronted by a harsh historical *finis saeculi*.  There is something satisfying about it, some confirmation of the rightness of the patterns we impose.  But as Focillon observed, the anxiety reflected by the *fin de siècle* is perpetual, and people don't wait for centuries to end before they express it.  Any date can be justified on some calculation or other. // And of course we have it now, the sense of an ending.  It has not diminshed, and is as endemic to what we call modernism as apocalyptic utopianism is to political revolution." (Kermode 98)

"It is commonplace that our times do in fact suffer a more rapid rate of change technologically, and consequently in the increase of social mobility, than any before us.  There is nothing fictive about that, and its implications are clear in our own day-to-day lives.  What is interesting, though, is the way in which this knowledge is related to apocalypse, so that a mere celebratory figure for social mobility, like _On the Road_, acquires apocalyptic overtones and establishes the language of an elect; and the way in which writers, that is to say, clerks, are willing to go along, arguing that the rate of change implies revolution or schism, and that this is a perpetual requirement; that the stage of transition, like the whole of time in an earlier revolution, has become *endless*" (Kermode 101)

"Crisis is a way of thinking about one's moment, and not inherent in the moment itself" (Kermode 101)

"we find in early modernism a hint of the real treason of the clerks" (Kermode 109) -- the fascism of Yeats, Pound, Wyndham Lewis, Eliot

"The fictions of modernist literature were revolutionary, new, though affirming a relation of complementarity with the past.  These fictions were, I think it is clear, related to others, which helped to shape the diastrous history of our time.  Fictions, notably the fiction of apocalypse, turn easily into myths; people will live by that which was designed only to know by" (Kermode 112)

"Transition is now, as I've said, elevated to secular status.  The arts certainly seem to be, in Yeats's words, multiform and antithetical.  The succession of styles, as Wyndham Lewis said, may be seen, under one aspect, as a helpless mimicry of the technology.  There is no shortage of evidence that this is a difficult state of affairs for critics to work on; the New is not a workable critical concept if you will not give up the hope that there are other indications of value than novelty, and this is only symptomatic of the difficulties experienced by anybody who thinks it wrong to speak of new things in an old language.  That the new modernism should be hard to talk about is a sign that there is a gap between the elect and the rest, and that is only another of its apocalyptic aspects.  In fact, what distinguishes the new from the older modernism most sharply in this context is not that one is more apocalyptic than the other but that they have such different attitudes toward the past.  To the older it is a source of order; to the newer it is that which ought to be ignored" (Kermode 114-15)

"It may be that our presuppositions as to order, in the world and in books, can be radically changed; Mr. McLuhan is one who would say so.  But the act of writing fictions continues to imply a public of a certain kind, a public which cannot visualize the conditions which might obtain after its own extinction" (Kermode 118)

"On Eliot's view of literature, for instance, newness is a phenomenon that affects the whole of the past; nothing on its own can be new.  That along distinguishes his modernism from avant-gardism" (Kermode 120)

"To speak clearly on these issues is to attract the charge that one is simply no longer young enough or bright enough to grasp the exciting things that are going on.  If what is happening is not a continuation but a mutation, then everything I say is wholly wrong.  All these talks may be so much waste paper devoted to the obsolete notion that there is a humanly needed order which we call form" (Kermode 123)

"it remains to affirm also the continuity of apocalyptic postures.  In a world otherwise seen as lacking the form that an end implies, this may seem absurd; indeed it is called so, and highly valued for being so.  Apocalypse is a part of the modern Absurd.  This is testimony to its vitality, a vitality dependent upon its truth to the set of our fear and desire.  Acknowledge, qualified by the scepticism of the slerks, it is -- even when ironized, even when denied -- an essential element in the arts, a permanent feature of a permanent literature of crisis" (Kermode 123-24)


V.  Literary Fiction and Reality

"It happens that in our phase of civility, the novel is the central form of literary art.  It lends itself to explanations borrowed from any intellectual system of the university which seems at the time satisfactory" (Kermode 128)

"The extremest revolt against the customs or laws of fiction -- the anti-novels of Fielding or Jane Austen or Flaubert or Natalie Sarraute -- creates its new laws, in their turn to be broken" (Kermode 129)

"Whether, with Lukács, you think of the novel as peculiarly the resolution of the problem of the individual in an open society -- or as relating to that problem in respect of an utterly contingent world; or express this in terms of the modern French theorists and call its progress a necessary and 'unceasing movement from the known to the unknown'; or simply see the novel as resembling the other arts in that it cannot avoid creating new possibilities for its own future -- however you put it, the history of the novel is the history of forms rejected or modified, by parody, manifesto, neglect, as absurd" (Kermode 129-30)

on Iris Murdoch: she, as "a novelist, finds much difficulty in resisting what she calls 'the consolations of form' and in that degree damages the 'opacity,' as she calls if, or character.  A novel has this (and more) in common with love, that it is, so to speak, delighted with its own inventions of character, but must respect their uniqueness and their freedom.  It must do so without losing the formal qualities that make it a novel.  But the truly imaginative novelist has an unshakable 'respect for the contingent'; without it he sinks into fantasy, which is a way of deforming reality.  'Since reality is incomplete, art must not be too afraid of incompleteness,' says Miss Murdoch.  We must not falsify it with patterns too neat, too inclusive; there must be dissonance" (Kermode 130)

"What I have to do is simply to show that _La Nausée_ represents, in the work of one extremely importand and representative figure, a kind of crisis in the relation between fiction and reality, the tension or dissonance between paradigmatic form and contingent reality.  That the mood of Sartre has sometimes been appropriate to the modern demythologized apocalypse is something I shall take for granted; his is a philosophy of crisis, but his world has no beginning and no end.  The absurd dishonestly of all prefabricated patterns is cardinal to his beliefs" (Kermode 133)

"How can novels, by telling lies, convert existence into being?" (Kermode 134-35)

"Novels, says Sartre, are not life, but they owe our power upon us, as upon himself as an infant, to the fact that they are somehow like life" (Kermode 135)

"Change without potentiality in a novel is impossible, quite simply; though it is the hopeless aim of the cut-out writers, and the card-shuffle writers.  A novel which really implemented this policy would properly be called a chaos.  No novel can avoid being in some sense what Aristotle calls 'a completed action.'  This being so, all novels imitate a world of potentiality, even if this implies a philosophy disclaimed by their authors" (Kermode 138)

"Novels, then, have beginnings, ends, and potentiality, even if the world has not" (Kermode 138)

"the denial of all causal relation between disparate *kairoi*, which is after all basic to Sartre's treatment of time, makes form impossible, and it would never occur to us that a book written to such a recipe, a set of discontinuous epiphanies, should be called a novel.  Perhaps we could not even read it thus: the making of a novel is partly the achievement of readers as well as writers, and readers would constantly attempt to supply the very connections that the writer's programme suppresses" (Kermode 139)

"The novel, then, provides a reduction of the world different from that of the treatise.  It has to lie.  Words, thoughts, patterns of word and though, are enemies of truth, if you identify that with what may be had by phenomenological reductions" (Kermode 140)

"how do novelistic differ from existential fictions?  How far is it inevitable that a novel give a novel-shaped account of the world?" (Kermode 143)

Sartre:  "'the final aim of art is to reclaim the world by revealing it as it is, but as if it had its source in human liberty.'  This statement does two things.  First, it links the fictions of art with those of living and choosing.  Secondly, it means that the humanizing of the world's contingency cannot be achieved without a representation of that contingency.  This representation must be such that it induces the proper sense of horror at the utter difference, the utter shapelessness, and the utter inhumanity of what must be humanized.  And it has to occur simultaneously with the *as if*, the act of form, of humanization, which assuages the horror" (Kermode 145)

_La Nausée_ as "something of a model of the conflicts in the modern theory of the novel.  How to do justice to a chaotic, viscously contingent reality, and yet redeem it?  How to justify the fictive beginnings, crises, ends; the atavism of character, which we cannot prevent from growing, in Yeats's figure, like ash on a burning stick?  The novel will end; a full close may be avoided, but there will be a close; a fake fullstop" (Kermode 145)

"Sartre began _La Nausée_ as an episodic work, and Roquentin's practices reflect this; but the need for structure grew imperious; it is not enough to write *comme les petites filles*.  Something begins that must have a consonant end: *quelque chose commence pour finir*.  There will be order" (Kermode 146)

"The *as if* of the novel is not so easily to be applied to life.  In life there are no beginnings, those 'fanfares of trumpets' which imply structures 'whose outlines are lost in the mist.'  In a novel, the beginning implies the end:  if you seem to begin at the beginning, 'It was a fine evening in 1922.  I was a notary's clerk in Marommes,' you are in fact beginning at the end; all that seems fortuitous and contingent in what follows is in fact reserved for a later benefaction of significance in some concordant structure" (Kermode 148)

"What is radically characteristic in Sartre's general position is his treatment of fiction as deeply distrusted and yet humanly indispensable.  In the novel, where there is an inescapable element of the counterfeit, and an inescapable inheritance of eidetic images, this mistrust of the indispensable produces that continuous *recherche* of which the new theorists speak; the *recherche* itself is not new; though it has been speeded up it is a permanent feature of the genre, which has always been threatened on one side from the need to mime contingency and from the other by the power of form to console.  In short, the pressures which require its constant alteration are anguish and bad faith" (Kermode 150-51)


VI.  Solitary Confinement

"I have been talking about [Christopher] Burney in this discursive way so that we can, if we like, think of his book as a model of a more gneeral solitary confinement, of the fictions and interpretations of human beings 'doing time,' imagining ends and concords.  'Men die because they cannot join the beginning to the end,' but living is trying to do it.  We give ourselves meaning by inventing critical time" (Kermode 164)

"Perhaps the autonomy of forms, of which we hear so much in Romantic, Symbolist, and Post-Symbolist criticism, is another reminder of incarcertaion; perhaps the autonomous forms which are called researches into the autonomy of forms -- so much modern poetry, we complain, is about modern poetry, and the new novel is a research into novels -- reflect our consciousness that deep in the cell we are using the shadows only, because we have lost the kind of confidence that enabled us to be interested in the apparent facts as well as in the human concords" (Kermode 164-65)

"In so far as there is an art of the timeless prison, it is poetry.... Novels, however, no matter how much they shift time, put slices of it layer on layer in search of intemporal concord, are always in some way bound to what Sartre calls its 'manifest irreversibility.'  Their beginnings, middles, and ends, however refined, will always join it somewhere" (Kermode 174)

"Merely to give order to these perspectives is to provide consolation, as De Quincey's opium did; and simple fictions are the opium of the people.  But fictions too easy we call 'escapist;' we want them not only to console but to make discoveries of the hard truth here and now, in the middest.  We do not feel they are doing this if we cannot see the shadow of the gable, or hear the discoveries of dissonance, the word set against the word.  The books which seal off the long perspectives, which sever us from our losses, which represent the world of potency as a world of act, these are the books which, when the drug wears off, go on to the dump with the other empty bottles.  Those that continue to interest us move through time to an end, an end we must sense even if we cannot know it" (Kermode 179)


Epilogue

on the complaint that the apocalypticism of the Cold War was somehow real, as opposed to previous fantasies of apocalypse: "This argument seemed and still seems to me palpably wrong.  Who supposes that fantasies cannot be terrible?  Terror does not depend upon an accurate estimate of the threat.  That should be obvious to all who have experienced childhood fears; and of the fears that assail us later in life, some no doubt are real enough, but some, as we discover with relief, are groundless" (Kermode 182-83)
