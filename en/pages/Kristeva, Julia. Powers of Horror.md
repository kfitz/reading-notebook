1.  Approaching Abjection

"When I am beset by abjection, the twisted braid of affects and thoughts I call by such a name does not have, properly speaking, a definable *object*." (Kristeva 1)

"The abject has only one quality of the object -- that of being opposed to *I*." (Kristeva 1)

"what is *abject*, on the contrary, the jettisoned object, is radically excluded and draws me toward the place where meaning collapses" (Kristeva 2)

"A weight of meaninglessness, about which there is nothing insignificant, and which crushes me.  On the edge of non-existence and hallucination, of a reality that, if I acknowledge it, annihilates me.  There, abject and abjection are my safeguards.  The primers of my culture." (Kristeva 2)

"I expel *myself*, I spit *myself* out, I abject *myself* within the same motion through which 'I' claim to establish *myself*." (Kristeva 3)

"During that course in which 'I' become, I give birth to myself amid the violence of sobs, of vomit." (Kristeva 3)

"No, as in true theater, without makeup or masks, refuse and corpses *show me* what I permanently thrust aside in order to live.... Such wastes drop so that I might live, until, from loss to loss, nothing remains in me and my entire body falls beyond the limit -- *cadere*, cadaver." (Kristeva 3)

"The corpse, seen without God and outside of science, is the utmost of abjection.  It is death infecting life." (Kristeva 4)

"It is thus not lack of cleanliness or health that causes abjection but what disturbs identity, system, order.  What does not respect borders, positions, rules.  The in-between, the ambiguous, the composite." (Kristeva 4)

"If it be true that the abject simultaneously beseeches and pulverizes the subject, one can understand that it is experienced at the peak of its strength when that subject, weary of fruitless attempts to identify with something on the outside, finds the impossible within; when it finds that the impossible constitutes its very *being*, that it *is* none other than abject.  The abjection of self would be the culminating form of that experience of the subject to which it is revealed that all its objects are based merely on the inaugural *loss* that laid the foundations of its being.  There is nothing like the abjection of self to show that all abjection is in fact recognition of the *want* on which any being, meaning, language, or desire is founded." (Kristeva 5)

"the experience of *want* itself as logically preliminary to being and object... abjection, and even more so abjection of self, is its only signified.  Its signifier, then, is none but literature." (Kristeva 5)

"it is out of such straying on excluded ground that he draws his jouissance" (Kristeva 8)

"The time of abjection is double: a time of oblivion and thunder, of veiled infinity and the moment when revelation bursts forth." (Kristeva 9)

"it jettisons the object into an abominable real, inaccessible except through jouissance.  It follows that jouissance alone causes the abject to exist as such." (Kristeva 9)

"there is nothing either objective or objectal to the abject.  It is simply a frontier, a repulsive gift that the Other, having become *alter ego*, drops so that 'I' does not disappear in it but finds, in that sublime alienation, a forfeited existence." (Kristeva 9)

"One thus understand why so many victims of the abject are its fascinated victims -- if not its submissive and willing ones." (Kristeva 9)

"abjection is above all ambiguity" (Kristeva 9)

"Abjection preserves what existed in the archaism of pre-objectal relationship, in the immemorial violence with which a body become separated from another body in order to be -- maintaining that night in which the outline of the signified thing vanishes and where only the imponderable affect is carried out." (Kristeva 10)

"when I *seek* (myself), *lose* (myself), or experience *jouissance* -- then 'I' is *heterogeneous*.  Discomfort, unease, dizziness stemming from an ambiguity that, through the violence of a revolt *against*, demarcates a space out of which signs and objects arise." (Kristeva 10)

"I experience abjection only if an Other has settled in place and stead of what will be 'me.' Not at all an other with whom I identify and incorporate, but an Other who precedes and possesses me, and through such possession causes me to be.  A possession previous to my advent: a being-there of the symbolic that a father might or might not embody." (Kristeva 10)

"If the abject is already a wellspring of sign for a non-object, on the edges of primal repression, one can understand its skirting the somatic symptom on the one hand and sublimation on the other." (Kristeva 11)

"In the symptom, the abject permeates me, I become abject.  Through sublimation, I keep it under control.  The abject is edged with the sublime." (Kristeva 11)

"Not at all short of but always with and through perception and words, the sublime is a *something added* that expands us, overstrains us, and causes us to be both *here*, as dejects, and *there*, as others and sparkling." (Kristeva 12)

"The abject is that pseudo-object that is made up *before* but appears only *within* the gaps of secondary repression.  *The abject would thus be the 'object' of primal repression.*" (Kristeva 12)

"The abject confronts us, on the one hand, with those fragile states where man strays on the territories of *animal*." (Kristeva 12)

"The abject confronts us, on the other hand, and this time within our personal archaeology, with our earliest attempts to release the hold of *maternal* entity even before ex-isting outside of her, thanks to the autonomy of language." (Kristeva 13)

"Abjection, with a meaning broadened to take in subjective diachrony, *is a precondition of narcissism.*" (Kristeva 13)

"Abjection is therefore a kind of *narcissistic crisis*: it is witness to the ephemeral aspect of the state called 'narcissism' with reproachful jealousy, heaven knows why; what is more, abjection gives narcissism (the thing and the concept) its classification as 'seeming'." (Kristeva 14)

"Abjection is a resurrection that has gone through death (of the ego).  It is an alchemy that transforms death drive into a start of life, of new significance." (Kristeva 15)

"The abject is related to perversion.... The abject is perverse because it neither gives up nor assumes a prohibition, a rule, or a law; but turns them aside, misleads, corrupts; uses them, takes advantage of them, the better to deny them." (Kristeva 15)

"The writer, fascinated by the abject, imagines its logic, projects himself into it, and as a consequence perverts language -- style and content." (Kristeva 16)

"It is only after his death, eventually, that the writer of abjection will escape his condition of waste, reject, abject.... Death would thus be the chief curator of our imaginary museum; it would protect us in the last resort from the abjection that contemporary literature claims to expend while uttering it." (Kristeva 16)

"Abjection accompanies all religious structurings and reappears, to be worked out in a new guise, at the time of their collapse." (Kristeva 17)

"The various means of *purifying* the abject -- the various catharses -- make up the history of religions.... Seen from that standpoint, the artistic experience, which is rooted in the abject it utters and by the same token purifies, appears as the essential component of religiosity" (Kristeva 17)

"It is possible to be cynical without being irremediably abject; abjection, on the other hand, is always brought about by that which attempts to get along with trampled-down law." (Kristeva 19)


2.  Something to Be Scared of

"From the start, fear and object are linked.  Can that be by accident?" (Kristeva 33)

"does it not amount to diverting the analytic process towards literature, or even stylistics?  Is this not asking the analyst to be rhetorical, to 'write' instead of 'interpreting'?" (Kristeva 37)

"But is not exactly language our ultimate and inseparable fetish?" (Kristeva 37)

"Finally, and this is the second reason why phobia does not disappear but slides beneath language, the phobic object is a proto-writing and, conversely, any practice of speech, inasmuch as it involves writing, is a language of fear." (Kristeva 38)

"verbalization has always been confronted with the 'ab-ject' that the phobic object is." (Kristeva 41)

"Abjection -- at the crossroads of phobia, obsession, and perversion -- shares in the same arrangement.  The loathing that is implied in it does not take on the aspect of hysteric conversion; the latter is the symptom of an ego that, overtaxed by a 'bad object,' turns away from it, cleanses itself of it, and vomits it.  In abjection, revolt is completely within being.  Within the being of language... the subject of abjection is eminently productive of culture.  Its symptom is the rejection and reconstruction of languages." (Kristeva 45)

"Voyeurism accompanies the writing of abjection.  When that writing stops, voyeurism becomes a perversion." (Kristeva 46)

"Abjection of self: the first approach to a self that would otherwise be walled in." (Kristeva 47)

"the collapse of the border between inside and outside" (Kristeva 53)

"Abjection then takes the place of the other, to the extent of affording him jouissance, often the only one for the borderline patient who, on that account, transforms the abject into the side of the Other" (Kristeva 54)

"Rarely does a woman tie her desire and her sexual life to that abjection, which, coming to her from the other, anchors her interiorly in the Other.  When that happens, one notes that it is through the expedient of writing that she gets there, and on that account she still has quite a way to go within the Oedipal mosaic before identifying with the owner of the penis." (Kristeva 54)

"the advent of one's own identity demands a law that mutilates, whereas jouissance demands an *abjection* from which identity becomes absent."  (Kristeva 54)

"The erotization of abjection, and perhaps any abjection to the extent that it is already eroticized, is an attempt at stopping the hemorrhage: a threshold before death, a halt or respite?" (Kristeva 55)


3.  From Filth to Defilement

"secular 'filth,' which has become sacred 'defilement,' is the *excluded* on the basis of which religious prohibition is made up.  In a number of primitive societies religious rites are purification rites whose function is to separate this or that social, sexual, or age group from another one, by means of prohibiting a filthy, defiling element" (Kristeva 65)

"The purification rite appears then as that essential ridge, which, prohibiting the filthy object, extracts it from the secular order and lines it at once with a sacred facet... abominated as ab-ject, as abjection, filth becomes defilement and founds on the henceforth released side of the 'self and clean' the order that is thus only (and therefore always already) sacred." (Kristeva 65)

"abjection is coextensive with social and symbolic order, on the individual as well as on the collective level.... But abjection assumes specific shapes and different codings according to the various 'symbolic systems.'" (Kristeva 68)

"Why does *corporeal waste*, menstrual blood and excrement, or everything that is assimilated to them, from nail-parings to decay, represent -- like a metaphor that would have become incarnate -- the objective frailty of symbolic order?" (Kristeva 70)

"polluting objects fall, schematically, into two types: excremental and menstrual.  Neither tears nor sperm, for instance, although they belong to the borders of the body, have any polluting value." (Kristeva 71)

"another logic of abjection:  it is no longer defilement to be excluded ritually as the other facet of the sacred (social, cultural, one's own) but *transgression* due to a *misreading* of the Law." (Kristeva 88)

"The border between abjection and the sacred, between desire and knowledge, between death and society, can be faced squarely, uttered without sham innocence or modest self-effacement, provided one sees in it an incidence of man's particularity as *mortal and speaking*" (Kristeva 88)


4.  Semiotics of Biblical Abomination

"Contrary to what enters the mouth and nourishes, what goes out of the body, out of its pores and openings, points to the infinitude of the body proper and gives rise to abjection" (Kristeva 108)

"But it is the corpse -- like, more abstractly, money or the golden calf -- that takes on the abjection of waste in the biblical text.  A decaying body, lifeless, completely turned into dejection, blurred between the inanimate and the inorganic, a transitional swarming, inseparable lining of a human nature whose life is undistinguishable from the symbolic -- the corpse represents fundamental pollution.  A body without soul..." (Kristeva 109)


5.  ...Qui Tollis Peccata Mundi

"an interiorization of abjection" (Kristeva 113)


6.  Céline:  Neither Actor Nor Martyr


7.  Suffering and Horror

\*-- the narrative as cache for suffering

"Suffering as the place of the subject." (Kristeva 140)

"Céline's narrative is a narrative of suffering and horror, not only because the 'themes' are there, as such, but because his whole narrative stance seems controlled by the necessity of going through abjection, whose intimate side is suffering and horror its public feature." (Kristeva 140)

"a narrative is, all in all, the most elaborate attempt, next to syntactic competence, to situate a speaking being between his desires and their prohibitions, in short, within the Oedipal triangle" (Kristeva 140)

"the narrative web is a thin film constantly threatened with bursting.  For, when narrated identity is unbearable, when the boundary between subject and object is shaken, and when even the limit between inside and outside becomes uncertain, the narrative is what is challenged first." (Kristeva 141)

"The narrative yields to a *crying-out theme* that, when it tends to coincide with the incandescent states of a boundary-subjectivity that I have called abjection, is the crying-out theme of suffering-horror.  In other words, the theme of suffering-horror is the ultimate evidence of such states of abjection within a narrative representation.  If one wished to proceed farther still along the approaches to abjection, one would find neither narrative nor theme but a recasting of syntax and vocabulary -- the violence of poetry, and silence." (Kristeva 141)


8.  Those Female Who Can Wreck the Infinite


9.  "Ours to Jew or Die"


10.  In the Beginning and Without End

"A laughing apocalypse is an apocalypse without god." (Kristeva 206)

"the beauty of a gesture that, here, on the page, compels language to come nearest to the human enigma, to the place where it kills, thinks, and experiences jouissance all at the same time.  A language of abjection of which the writer is both subject and victim, witness and topple." (Kristeva 206)


11.  Powers of Horror

"On close inspection, all literature is probably a version of the apocalypse that seems to me rooted, no matter what its socio-historical conditions might be, on the fragile border (borderline cases) where identities (subject/object, etc.) do not exist or only barely so -- double, fuzzy, heterogeneous, animal, metamorphosed, altered, abject." (Kristeva 207)
