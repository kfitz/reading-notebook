Darnton, Robert. “What is the History of Books?” Daedalus 111.3 (Summer 1982): 65-83.


"its name varies from place to place, but everywhere it is being recognized as an important new discipline.  It might even be called the social and cultural history of communication by print, if that were not such a mouthful, because its purpose is to understand how ideas were transmitted through print and how exposure to the printed word affected the through and behavior of mankind during the last five hundred years." (Darnton 65)

"To get some distance from interdisciplinarity run riot, and to see the subject as a whole, it might be useful to propose a general model for analyzing the way books come into being and spread through society." (Darnton 67)

"It could be described as a communications circuit that runs from the author to the publisher (if the bookseller does not assume that role), the printer, the shipper, the bookseller, and the reader.  The reader completes the circuit, because he influences the author both before and after the act of composition.  Authors are readers themselves.  By reading and associating with other readers and writers, they form notions of genre and style and a general sense of the literary enterprise, which affects their texts..." (Darnton 67)

"To keep their task within manageable proportions, book historians generally cut into one segment of the communications circuit and analyze it according to the procedures of a single discipline -- printing, for example, which they study by means of analytical bibliography.  But the parts do not take on their full significance unless they are related to the whole, and some holistic view of the book as a means of communication seems necessary if book history is to avoid being fragmented into esoteric specializations, cut off from each other by arcane techniques and mutual misunderstanding." (Darnton 67)

"Reading remains the most difficult stage to study in the circuit followed by books." (Darnton 74)

"a seventeenth century London burgher inhabited a different mental universe from that of a twentieth century American professor.  Reading itself has changed over time.  It was often done aloud and in groups, or in secret and with an intensity we may not be able to imagine today." (Darnton 78)

"The history of reading will have to take account of the ways that texts constrain readers as well as the ways that readers take liberties with texts." (Darnton 79)

"If it is possible to recapture the great rereadings of the past, the inner experience of ordinary readers may always elude us.  But we should at least be able to reconstruct a good deal of the social context of reading.  The debate about silent reading during the Middle Ages has produced some impressive evidence about reading habits, and studies of reading societies in Germany, where they proliferated to an extraordinary degree in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, have shown the importance of reading in the development of a distinct bourgeois cultural style." (Darnton 79)

"The shift from intensive to extensive reader coincided with a desacralization of the printed word.  The world began to be cluttered with reading matter, and texts began to be treated as commodities that could be discarded as casually as yesterday's newspaper." (Darnton 79)

"All this work opens onto the larger problem of how exposure to the printed word affects the way men think.  Did the invention of movable type transform man's mental universe?  There may be no single satisfactory answer to that question, because it bears on so many different aspects of life in early modern Europe, as Elizabeth Eisenstein has shown.  But it should be possible to arrive at a firmer understanding of what books meant to people.  Their use in the taking of oaths, the exchanging of gifts, the awarding of prizes, and the bestowing of legacies would provide clues to their significance within different societies." (Darnton 80)

"By its very nature, therefore, the history of books must be international in scale and interdisciplinary in method.  But it need not lack conceptual coherence, because books belong to circuits of communication that operate in consistent patterns, however complex they may be.  By unearthing those circuits, historians can show that books do not merely recount history; they make it." (Darnton 81)
