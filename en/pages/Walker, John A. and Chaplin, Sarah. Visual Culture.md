Introduction

‘visual culture’ as new field or object of study; multidisciplinary

defined here as “those material artifacts, buildings and images, plus time-based media and performances, produced by human labour and imagination, which serve aesthetic, symbolic, ritualistic, or ideological-political ends, and/or practical functions, and which address the sense of sight to a significant extent” (Walker and Chaplin 2)

emphasis on visual elements distinguishes visual culture studies from media studies

but visual culture also used to describe an attribute of a society of social strata; visual skills and experiences; not quite the sense meant here

1.  Concepts of “culture”

introduction to various meanings of the term “culture”

culture and nature:  culture is what humans have done to or added to nature; argue here that nature, not economy, is determinant in the last instance

base and superstructure:  culture as superstructure, determined by economy

culture and civilization: often used as synonyms, but “civilized society” is sophisticated, polite, orderly, rational, etc.; “culture” is found in both “civilized” and “barbaric” societies

cultural capital: competence within a social group; culture industries

culture and class:  high, middle-brow, low; high culture seen as improving and elevating, low culture as vulgar; hierarchy homologous to class structure — broadly accurate, but crude, ahistorical; distinction needs to be made between folk and mass culture

anthropology and sociology: define culture as the whole way of life of a society, include customs and rituals in addition to material culture

cultures in the plural: emphasis on multiplicity; distinctions between local and regional cultures v. national cultures; subcultures; however, plurality does not mean equality (dominant/subordinate; emergent/residual)

cultures in conflict

culture and barbarism: culture perceived as finest achievement of humankind, but often oppressive; visual culture studies often critical, suspicious of celebratory attitude toward culture; Walter Benjamin:  “There is no document of human culture which is not at the same time a document of barbarism.”

multiculturalism:  difficulties presented by pluralistic discourse

2.  The concept of “the visual”

vision: physiognomy of the eyes; psychology of visual perception (Arnheim, Gibson, Gregory, etc.); relation of vision to other senses (apperception; synaesthesia); mental images; afterimages; “seeing is believing” v. “appearances are deceptive”

vision and the other senses: Michael Taussig, Mimesis and Alterity: A Particular History of the Senses; Martin Jay, Downcast Eyes:  The Denigration of Vision in Twentieth-Century France — ocular-centrism displaced, vision comes to be seen as “complicit in social oppression via surveillance and spectacle” (Walker and Chaplin 19); vision and the gaze as patriarchal; Donald Lowe, History of Bourgeois Perception, traces dominace of sight

visuality:  vision as physiological/psychological process; visuality as social process, vision socialized

mediated vision:  seeing “images” or representations rather than seeing the world (unmediated vision); modern culture characterized by mediation

art forms that address more than the eyes: tactility of sculpture and painting; aurality of film and video; kinetics of architecture

mixed media:  W.J.T. Mitchell — “imagetext”; Peter Wagner — “iconotexts”; haptic and kinaesthetic elements; “scopic drive”

visual representation:  differences in modes of visual representation determined not by physiological processes but social ones; different “scopic regimes” (ways of seeing) institute different forms of representation; Gombrich, Art and Illusion; insights from psychology and linguistics brought to bear on visual culture

retinal and anti-retinal art: eye-pleasing versus thought-provoking; visual versus conceptual

artifacts and viewers: active process of reading images; raises question of whether the object of study of visual culture studies is internal or external — audience analysis or textual analysis

3.  Visual culture as a field of study, and the origins of Visual Culture Studies

the field of visual culture:  Pierre Bourdieu, The Field of Cultural Production — individual artifacts cannot be understood in isolation, but must be regarded as “manifestations of the whole field of cultural production” (Walker and Chaplin 31); structural relations, forces, struggle; field of cultural production exists within the field of production generally

disinterested creation: one aspect of field of cultural production that apparently inverts economic drives of field of production; but there is interest in disinterestedness

the quantity problem: too much stuff to study; must specialize

the corpus: most narrow down by selecting one form or type of visual culture, by studying “masterpieces”, and/or by studying pieces thought to be representative; but selection implies familiarity with a corpus or body of material

origins of visual culture studies: traced back to political shifts of 60s; overlap of art history with communication/cultural/film/media studies [***Melanie Phillips, “The Videotic Age of the Philistine,” The Observer (13 August 1995), 25 — argues that visual culture was undermining the literary***]

art history and fine art: shift in focus from high art of art history to broader range of art in visual culture

the new art history: like Berger, study from a left perspective, but still canonical, patriarchal, focus on high art

feminist art history: first focus on neglected women artists, issues of sexual difference, and representations of women, but later extended to include analysis of masculinity, gender, and sexuality

postcolonial theory: relation between center and periphery, concept of the other scrutinized; primitivism, orientalism, colonialism

design history; architectural history

film/media/communication studies:  characterize media studies as being more interested in ideology, hegemony, ownership, media institutions, press, audience analysis, etc., while visual culture studies is more interested in aesthetics; McLuhan, Eco, Barthes, Williamson

cultural studies:  Birmingham school:  Richard Hoggart, Stuart Hall; Dick Hebdige, Angela McRobbie, etc.; doesn’t foreground the visual; often more sociological; criticized for being ahistorical and for ignoring aesthetics

4.  Coping with theory

language and visual culture: ekphrasis — need for scholars of visual culture to represent the visual verbally

criticism; intrinsic difficulties (in teaching, in study); context and history

the necessity for theory:  “without theories and hypotheses we would be overwhelmed by a mass of impressions, by immense quantities of empirical data.” (Walker and Chaplin 58); “Everyone’s ideas are based on theories — however crude or mistaken — about the world” (Walker and Chaplin 58)

French theory:  “intellectual fashions” (Walker and Chaplin 59)

the utility of theory:  “the choice is not between theory and no theory but which theory” (Walker and Chaplin 60)

theory and politics:  “For people who are politically conscious and committed, theory — in the famous words of Marx — is not only a means of interpreting the world, it is also a means of changing it.” (Walker and Chaplin 61)

theory and practice:  not fully integrated

5.  Production, distribution and consumption model

production:  field of visual culture within field of cultural production within field of production generally

needs, desires; cultural producers; authorship; resources; materials and toold; ideological and aesthetic resources

artifacts/products; distribution, circulation and exchange; consumption, reception and use; taste; preservation and conservation; social effects; cycles and social change

6.  Institutions

Raymond Williams’ four categories:  authoritarian, paternalistic, commercial, democratic

production; agencies and practices; educational institutions; trade unions and professional organizations; the RIBA

display, distribution, marketing and promotion; arts councils; the crafts council; national and international bodies; multi-purpose institutions; alternative and anti-institutions; regulatory and censorship institutions; museums and galleries; heritage institutions

7.  Looks, the gaze, and surveillance

the eye and the gaze:  amplification of optical power through technology; being watched

looks in pictures:  the scopic drive; looking as content; 4 looks:  look of artists towards scene to be recorded, looks exchanged by depicted characters, look of spectator towards the image, looks exchanged between characters and spectators; oppressiveness of technological gaze in the cinematic apparatus

voyeurism:  scopophilia (Freud); gendered spectator position

viewpoint in film:  objective v. subjective shots

mirrors:  Lacan & mirror stage; gaze of subject back at spectator dissolves boundary between image-space and real space

surveillance:  surveillance by representations (portraits of God, dictators); panopticon; ‘monitoring of public spaces is assisted by electronic eyes’ (Walker and Chaplin 107)

“no act of looking is innocent” (Walker and Chaplin 109)

8.  Visual literacy and visual poetics

literacy; multimedia; contextual knowledge; visual literacy and skills; improving visual literacy; slide tests; practical exercises; ‘reading’ images; from work to text

pictorial rhetoric and visual poetics:  simile, metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, hyperbole, personification, symbols, allegory; other poetic devices:  alliteration, assonance, quotation, rhyme, paraphrase, chiasmus; double meanings

9.  Modes of analysis

form and content; content analysis; iconography and iconology (descriptive and classificatory v. interpretive); mythologies; genre and type analyses; form and style analyses; semiotic analysis; structuralism; deconstruction; physical context; intertextuality; hermeneutics (science of interpretation/exegesis)

10.  The pleasures of visual culture

analysis versus pleasure; pleasures of producing and consuming; varieties of pleasure; ornament; the functions of pleasure; subjective or objective?; aesthetic pleasure; Renaissance aesthetics; formalism; traditional versus modern art; ugliness; horror and suffering in art; aestheticization of violence

11.  The canon and concepts of value

value:  artistic, use, sentimental, exchange; valuation and evalution:  monetary value v. intellectual/aesthetic judgment; ranking; evaluating and ranking films and records; masterpieces, classics and cult objects; the canon; cultural relativism

12.  Visual culture and commerce

gifts; commodities; commodity fetishism; works of art as commodities; commerce and content; objections to commodities; the culture industry; rock and pop music; art and economics; intellectual property rights; plagiarism

13.  New technologies

defining technology:  ‘techne’ = art or skill

past and present:  manual tools to mechanical tools to electronics

mechanical reproduction; technological determination and determinism; McLuhan and the mass media

artists and technology; computer art/graphics; computer-aided design; computer-control systems; digital imagery; telematics or information art; the internet and virtual reality; invisibility; redundancy and obsolescence

reactions to new technology:  enthusiast/futurists; supporters of ‘appropriate’ and ‘alternative’ tech; ‘modern primitivists’; ‘new Luddites’
