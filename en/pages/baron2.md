# Baron, Naomi. *Words Onscreen: The Fate of Reading in a Digital World*. Forthcoming: Oxford University Press.

## nl;pr: Not Long; Please Read: A Preface

"Does it matter what medium we use for reading: print or digital text?" (1)

"When doing research, I nearly always go for printed text (as do many professionals). I underline, write notes, draw arrows, attach post-its... I tend to remember where to find what I have read by physical signposts: about half-way through, on the upper right-hand side" (3)

"_Words Onscreen_ asks if digital reading is reshaping our understanding of what it means to read.... I will argue that digital reading is find for many short pieces or for light content we don't intend to analyze or reread. However, if eReading is less well suited for many longer works or even for short ones requiring serious thought, what happens to reading if we shift from print to screens? Will some of the uses of reading (and, for that matter, writing) fall by the wayside? If so, with what implications for education, culture, and ourselves?" (4)

"If reading habits change, so do the ways authors tend to write. Computers, and now portable digital devices, coax us to skim rather than read in-depth, search rather than traverse continuous prose." (5)

"Since the emergence of print culture in the eighteenth century, and particularly with the rise of the novel and later the detective story, much of our reading has been one-off.... For one-off reading, digital devices may be every bit as good as print. But what about more serious reading?... To the extent we shift our reading from print to screens, we become less likely to reread." (6)

"Reading onscreen raises another question about the nature of reading: Is it an individual encounter with a text or essentially a social enterprise?" (6)

## Chapter 1 - "I Hate Books": Words Go Digital

concern with "whether new digital technologies will upend our understanding of what it means to read in the first place" (1.3)

lots of studies of ebook adoption, sales, etc.

studies seem to report no differences in how we read in print vs onscreen, but "When asked, the majority -- sometimes vast majority -- say they prefer reading in print." (1.13)

concerns about distractions available when reading on tablets

William Gass, "In Defense of the Book" (1999); "Abstractions Arrive: Having Been There All the Time" (2012)

container vs content; books as objects

## Chapter 2 - Reading Evolves

"reading on the prowl" versus "continuous reading"

"researchers at University College London, in analyzing how academics approach text on digital screens, describe the activity not as reading but 'power browsing'." (2.4)

"Stallybrass argues that while continuous reading characterizes the way we approach novels or detective stories, what I call reading on the prowl has been closer to the norm for practically everything else since the development of the book form (the codex) in the early centuries of the Common Era." (2.5-6)

close ties between reading and writing

"Comparatively speaking, eBooks are harder to annotate than print. In the memorable words of John Dickerson, chief political correspondent at _Slate_, 'marking up text [on an iPad] is... like eating candy through a wrapper'." (2.13)

issues with electronic annotation: risk of preservation failure, risk of loss of privacy

developing affordances of the codex, including the rise of the title page, tables of contents, indexes (2.16); alphabetization and page numbers (2.17)

intensive vs extensive reading; 18th c. need for "solutions" to the "too much to read" problem, including "abridgments, anthologies, encyclopedias, serialization, and condensation" (2.21)

"This snippet approach to reading, enabled by online search tools, is one of the downsides of digital reading's search affordance. But the snippet frame of mind also pops up in the way students use print sources." (2.25) -- not just students! Anecdote about overhearing someone in grad school say "books aren't meant to be read; they're meant to be consulted"

%% Baron is concerned with the ways that the digital shifts us from continuous reading to reading on the prowl -- and yet, the digital is also seen as a site for reading for pleasure, which is and has always been more continuous than reading for other purposes. What I want to suggest at this point is that scholars have long read on the prowl, and that where we wish to engage in deeper study of texts in a continuous fashion, we probably need better tools rather than necessarily to retreat from the screen altogether.

"The meaning of 'reading' increasingly becomes 'finding information' - and often settling for the first thing that comes to hand - rather than 'contemplating and understanding'. Adler would hardly approve." (2.26) -- and yet Adler had to make his argument precisely because "contemplating and understanding" wasn't the dominant mode of reading in his day, either. "Contemplating and understanding" has always been a specialized mode of reading.

## Chapter 3 - tl;dr: Readers Reshape Writing

17th and 18th century history of ephemeral publishing forms: from broadsides, almanacs, and chapbooks; to magazines and other periodicals; also, encyclopedias, abridgements, anthologies, reviews, serials, condensed books, Cliff's Notes.

"There is a long history of saving readers time and money, especially when there is too much to read. // How are these techniques playing out onscreen?" (3.18)

"Make no mistake: Short-form reading can be both enjoyable and edifying. The essay is short-form, as (obviously) are short stories. The issue is whether today's surge in snack-sized texts also marks a move towards more lightweight reading." (3.21)

## Chapter 4 - The Appeal of Words Onscreen

benefits of digital reading: privacy, convenience, cost; issues in e-book pricing; environmental questions

## Chapter 5 - The Web Ate My Print Option: One-Off Reading

"The historical roots of one-off reading reflect a confluence of developments in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The printing press began generating a flood of words on paper. Costs fell, while the size of the literate population rose. Intensive gave way to extensive reading, and novels and newspapers increasingly became everyday fare. The appearance of paperbacks made it feel less odious to discard a book when you were done with it." (5.3)

"The ephemeral nature of digital texts puts us more in the role of visitor than proprietor." (5.4) ++ It's not ephemerality she's noting here, but a different ownership relation. ++
