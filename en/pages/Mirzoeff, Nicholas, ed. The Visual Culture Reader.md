Introductions/Provocations.

1.  Mirzoeff, Nicholas.  "What Is Visual Culture?" 3-13.

"the new visuality of culture" (Mirzoeff 3)

reader as attempt to define the field, which remains fluid

"postmodernism is visual culture" (Mirzoeff 4)

"visual culture is a tactic with which to study the genealogy, definition, and functions of postmodern everyday life." (Mirzoeff 5)

emergence of visual culture as a subject challenges the intellectual hegemony of the spoken [? Not printed?] word" (Mirzoeff 5) — Mitchell's "picture theory"

"One of the most striking features of the new visual culture is the visualization of things that are not in themselves visual." (Mirzoeff 6)

"Visual culture directs our attention away from structured, formal viewing settings like the cinema and the art gallery to the centrality of visual experience in everyday life." (Mirzoeff 7)

the visual "offers a sensual immediacy that cannot be rivalled by print media:  the very element that makes visual imagery of all kinds distinct from texts." (Mirzoeff 9) — the distinction is proximity to the sublime

2.  Rogoff, Irit.  "Studying Visual Culture." 14-26.

need to characterize the interdisciplinary work of visual culture as Barthes does:  not surrounding the object of study with numerous modes of inquiry, but rather constituting a new object of knowledge (Rogoff 15)

"By focusing on a field of vision and of visual culture operating within it, we create the space for the articulation of (but not necessarily the reponse to) such questions as:  What are the visual codes by which some are allowed to look, others to hazard a peek, and still others are forbidden to look altogether?  In what political discourses can we understand looking and returning the gaze as an act of political resistance?  Can we actually participate in the pleasure and identify with the images produced by culturally specific groups to which we do not belong?" (Rogoff 16)

field made up of at least three different components:  "the images that come into being and are claimed by various, and often contested, histories… the viewing apparatuses that we have at our disposal that are guided by cultural models such as narrative or technology… the subjectivities of identification or desire or abjection from which we view and by which we inform what we view" (Rogoff 18)

work of visual culture studies as a kind of "unframing"

3.  Shohat, Ella and Stam, Robert.  "Narrativizing Visual Culture:  Towards a Polycentric Aesthetics."  27-49.

visual culture as break with Eurocentrism not only of "good eye" art history but also of radical high-modern avant-gardism — thus break with "progressive" histories in which realism, modernism, postmodernism follow in orderly succession

recasting art historical narratives to avoid lines in which non-European cultures exist in a different "time zone" from the European (as though they're lagging behind and trying to catch up) and in which the non-European exists solely as source material for the European

"Our specific goal here is to interrogate the conventional sequencing of realism/modernism/postmodernism by looking at some of the alternative aesthetics offered by Third World, postcolonial, and minoritarian cultural practices:  practices that dialogue with Western art movements but which also critique them and in some ways go beyond them." (Shohat and Stam 31)

alternative aesthetics:  the archaic postmodern; carnivalesque subversions; modernist anthropophagy; the aesthetics of garbage

seeking a polycentric visual culture

Part One.  A Genealogy of Visual Culture:  From Art to Culture

Introduction to Part One.  53-59.

pioneering work of last 15 years that led to emergence of visual culture

"how a critical examination of vision itself and its representation in art history has led to a significant shift in methodology in the past decade." (Mirzoeff 53)

gradually expanding interdisciplinarity

Descartes's work on optics as "the inception of a modern notion of vision" (Mirzoeff 53)
