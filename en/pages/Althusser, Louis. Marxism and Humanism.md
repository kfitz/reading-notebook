objective of struggle has always been liberation, but in first phase, had to take form of class humanism (dictatorship of the proletariat)

now, in second phase, class humanism is giving way to socialist humanism (personal humanism)

“socialism” = scientific; “humanism” = ideological

the humanism of Reason

communalist humanism

Marx’s break with “essence of man”; historical materialism

ideology v. science

“ideology is not an aberration or a contingent execrescence of History: it is a structure essential to the historical life of societies” (232)

ideology as unconscious

ideology = lived relation between men and world; (“In ideology men do express, not the relation between them and their conditions of existence, but the way they live the relation between them and their conditions of existence: this presupposes both a real relation and an ‘imaginary,’ ‘lived’ relation.” [233])
