Esposito, Joseph J. "The Processed Book." First Monday 8.3 (2003). <http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1038/959>


"It may be that the current debate about electronic publishing is missing the point, however; it may be too focused on devices (however amazingly cool these devices may be) and is not reaching to the heart of the matter, which is why we care about books in the first place. We care about books because of what's inside them, because of what they mean."

"The notion of authenticity is insidious and, apparently, resistant to all attempts to stamp it out."

"the myth of the primal book is too potent to be troubled by the facts. Books are what authors write. Books express authors' ideas. Books have a certain integrity born of the fact that they are the authentic manifestations of the serious men and women who create them."

"I offer this caricature of the traditional book in order to more easily contrast it with the evolving forms of electronic publishing, where the author's authentic voice is buried within a network of references and interpretations. This is the world of the processed book, the book where the primal utterance of the author gives rise to hyperlinks and paralinks and neural networks and whatever other kinds of connections and cross-connections computer scientists come up with."

"This is painful to behold for someone who prayed earnestly that Isabel Archer would not return to Osmond, but words are symbols and are ideally suited for the manipulations of the symbolic logic of computers. The processed book takes Isabel Archer and shows her to be the collection of words that she is. She then can be processed."

book as portal, self-referencing text, platform, machine component, network node

"A book becomes a specialized portal by encouraging readers to click through to other sources of information."

"One aspect of the book as portal is that it undermines the reading experience even as it augments it. Reading is linear and requires concentration. A portal link takes the reader away from the author's linear design and focuses his or her attention on other text. While that text may enrich the meaning of the original book, it also distracts the reader, who then must reorient him or herself upon returning to the primary material. As authors become increasingly aware of the potentialities of the processed book, we should expect that they will begin to write with these jumps in attention in mind."

"The processed book can show us word frequencies; it can map such frequencies against a statistically determined dictionary of 'normal' usage, note the standard deviation, and output the result visually; it can associate certain words with specific characters; it can identify webs of metaphors that even the most attentive of readers may have missed."

"The processed book is spatial: it takes the linear progression of a book and makes events from different times spring to mind simultaneously. It takes the primary book and makes it comment upon itself."

"do more citations mean that a paper is better? And what do we mean by 'better' anyway? Or is it simply that we have thrown up our hands at the really hard question, the determination of value (an artifact, we should note, of the primal book), and have chosen instead to use a computer-assessible mechanism, a simple count, as a proxy for the hard question? This is not to say that this measure of the processed book is wrong; it simply isn't exactly right. We don't use it because it gives us the right answer, we use it because it gives us an easily derived answer"

"A book-as-platform announces its availability to be invoked by other books in part through the suite of tools it makes available to third parties. A good book with no tools will not get invoked often."

"the exceptional book will foster its own followers, who will assemble the network of processing tools around it."

"By being placed within a network, where it is pointed to and pointed from, where it is analyzed and measured and processed and redistributed, a book reveals its connections to all other books."

"A processed book, however, can be published as a node in a network, with connections to other books, commentary, online library card catalogues, teachers‚Äô recommendations, and so forth. If the network is usefully developed (and this is an important "if," for links and other connections for their own sake can be a distraction), the value of the book-as-node is greatly enhanced by being part of it."
