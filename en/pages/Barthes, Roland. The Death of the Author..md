Barthes, Roland.  "The Death of the Author."  In The Rustle of Language.  Trans. Richard Howard.  New York:  Hill and Wang, 1986.  49-55.


"writing is the destruction of every voice, every origin.  Writing is that neuter, that composite, that obliquity into which our subject flees, the black-and-white where all identity is lost, beginning with the very identity of the body that writes" (Barthes 49)

"The *author* is a modern character, no doubt produced by our society as it emerged from the Middle Ages, inflected by English empiricism, French rationalism, and the personal faith of the Reformation, thereby discovering the prestige of the individual, or, as we say more nobly, of the 'human person.'  Hence, it is logical that in literary matters it should be positivism, crown and conclusion of capitalist ideology, which has granted the greatest importance to the author's 'person'" (Barthes 49-50)

"the image of literature to be found in contemporary culture is tyrannically centered on the author" (Barthes 50)

"*explanation* of the work is still sought in the person of its producer, as if, through the more or less transparent allegory of fiction, it was always, ultimately, the voice of one and the same person, the *author* which was transmitting his 'confidences'" (Barthes 50)

"In France, Mallarmé, no doubt the first, saw and foresaw in all its scope the necessity fo substitute language itself for the subject hitherto supposed to be its owner; for Mallarmé, as for us, it is language which speaks, not the author; to write is to reach, through a preliminary impersonality -- which we can at no moment identify with the realistic novelist's castrating 'objectivity' -- that point where not 'I' but only language functions, performs: Mallarmé's whoe poetics consists in suppressing the author in favor of writing (and thereby restoring, as we shall see, the reader's place" (Barthes 50)

"by constantly striving to disappoint expected meanings (this was the famous surrealist 'shock'), by urging the hand to write as fast as possible what the head was unaware of (this was automatic writing), by accepting the principle and the experiment of collective writing, Surrealism helped desacralize the image of the Author" (Barthes 51)

"linguistics furnishes the destruction of the Author with a precious analytical instrument, showing that the speech-act in its entirety is an 'empty' process, which functions perfectly without its being necessary to 'fill' it with the person of the interlocutors: linguistically, the author is nothing but the one who writes, just as *I* is nothing but the one who says *I*: language knows a 'subject,' not a 'person,' and this subject, empty outside of the very speech-act which defines it, suffices to 'hold' language, i.e., to exhaust it" (Barthes 51)

"The removal of the Author... is not only a historical fact or an act of writing:  it utterly transforms the modern text (or -- which is the same thing -- the text is henceforth produced and read so that the author absents himself from it at every level)" (Barthes 51-52)

"The Author, when we believe in him, is always conceived as the past of his own book.... Quite the contrary, the modern *scriptor* is born *at the same time* as his text; he is not furnished with a being which precedes or exceeds his writing, he is not the subject of which his book would be the predicate" (Barthes 52)

"We know now that a text consists not of a line of words, released a single 'theological' meaning (the 'message' of the Author-God), but of a multi-dimensional space in which are married and contested several writings, none of which is original:  the text is a fabric of quotations, resulting from a thousand sources of culture" (Barthes 52-53)

"the writer can only imitate an ever anterior, never original gesture; his sole power is to mingle writings, to counter some by others, so as never to rely on just one; if he seeks to *express himself*, at least he knows that the itnerior 'thing' he claims to 'translate' is itself no more than a ready-made lexicon, whose words can be explained only through other words, and this ad infinitum" (Barthes 53)

"life merely imitates the book, and this book itself is but a tissue of signs, endless imitation, infinitely postponed" (Barthes 53)

"To assign an Author to a text is to impose a brake on it, to furnish it with a final signified, to close writing.  This conception is quite suited to criticism, which then undertakes the important task of discovering the Author (or his hypostases: society, history, the psyche, freedom) beneath the work: once the Author is found, the text is 'explained,' the critic has won" (Barthes 53)

"writing constantly posits meaning, but always in order to evaporate it; writing seems a systematic exemption of meaning" (Barthes 54)

of Balzac's sentence:  "No one (i.e., no 'person') says it; its source, its voice is not the true site of writing, it is reading" (Barthes 54)

"a text consists of multiple writings, proceeding from several cultures and entering into dialogue, into parody, into contestation; but there is a site where this multiplicity is collected, and this site is not the author, as has hitherto been claimed, but the reader: the reader is the very space in which are inscribed, without any of them being lost, all of the citations out of which a writing is made" (Barthes 54)

"the unity of a text is not in its origin but in its destination, but this destination can no longer be personal:  the reader is a man without history, without biography, without psychology; he is only that *someone* who holds collected into one and the same field all of the traces from which writing is constituted" (Barthes 54)

"in order to restore to writing its future, we must reverse the myth:  the birth of the reader must be requited by the death of the Author" (Barthes 55)
