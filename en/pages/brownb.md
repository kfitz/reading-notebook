"We begin to confront the thingness of objects when they stop working for us" (4)

Latour's insistence that "things do not exist without being full of people" (qtd on 12)

"Theodor Adorno, arguing against epistemology's and phenomenology's subordination of the object and the somatic moment to a fact of consciousness, understood the alterity of things as an essentially ethical fact. Most simply put, his point is that accepting the otherness of things is the condition for accepting otherness as such." (12)

"how inanimate objects organize the temporality of the animate world" (16)

"In the case of the Oldenburg eraser, the present, which is the future that turned this object into a thing of the past, is the discourse network 2000, where the typewriter eraser has disappeared, not just into the self-correcting Selectric, but into the delete function" (16)

"if the topic of things attained a new urgency in the closing decades of that century, this may have been a response to the digitization of our world" (16)

"things inevitably seem too late -- belated, in fact, because we want things to come before ideas, before theory, before the word, whereas they seem to persist in coming after: as the alternative to ideas, the limit to theory, victims of the word." (16)
