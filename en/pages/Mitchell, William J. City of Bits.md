Mitchell, William J.  City of Bits:  Space, Place, and the Infobahn.  Cambridge:  MIT Press,  1995.

1.  Pulling Glass

“Just as Baron Haussmann had imposed a bold spider’s web of broad, straight boulevards on the ancient tangle of Paris, and as nineteenth-century railroad workers had laid sleepers and steel to shrink the windy distances of the North American frontier, these post-whatever construction crews were putting in place an Infobahn — and thus reconfiguring space and time relationships in ways that promised to change our lives forever.” (Mitchell 3)

overt connections between this network and the globalized economy:  the components of the laptop he’s writing on “were engineered and manufactured concurrently at locations throughout the world — from Silicon Valley to Singapore…. The various design, component manufacture, and product assembly tasks were perfomed not within a single industrial corporation, but by different members of an intricate international alliance.” (Mitchell 4)

essays in the book “reimagine architecture and urbanism in the new context suggested by these observations — that of the digital telecommunications revolution, the ongoing miniaturization of electronics, the commodification of bits, and the growing domination of software over materialized form.” (Mitchell 5)

lived space still matters:  the “most crucial task before us” is “imagining and creating digitally mediated environments for the kinds of lives that we will want to lead and the sorts of communities that we will want to have.” (Mitchell 5)

why it matters:  “because the emerging civic structures and spatial arrangements of the digital era will profoundly affect our access to economic opportunities and public services, the character and content of public discourse, the forms of cultural activity, the enaction of power, and the experiences that give shape and texture to our daily routines” (Mitchell 5)

2.  Electronic Agoras

“the worldwide computer network — the electronic agora — subverts, displaces, and radically redefines our notions of gather place, community, and urban life.  The Net has a fundamentally different physical structure, and it operates under quite different rules from those that organize the action in the public places of traditional cities.  It will play as crucial a role in twenty-first-century urbanity as the centrally located, spatially bounded, architecturally celebrated agora did (according to Aristotle’s Politics) in the life of the Greek polis” (Mitchell 8)

“The Net negates geometry.” (Mitchell 8) — net as “fundamentally and profoundly antispatial” (Mitchell 8)

“the Net eliminates a traditional dimension of civic legibility… [in which] geography is destiny.” (Mitchell 10)

“the Net’s despatialization of interaction destroys the geocode’s key.  There is no such thing as a better address…” (Mitchell 10)

embodiment/disembodiment; synchronous/asynchronous; narrowband/broadband; voyeurism/engagement; contiguous/connected

“The Net creates new opportunities, but exclusion from it becomes a new form of marginalization.” (Mitchell 18)

“With higher bandwidths, ever-greater processing power, and more sophisticated input/output devices designed to take advantage of these capabilities, the boundary that has traditionally been drawn by the edge of the computer screen will be eroded.” (Mitchell 20)

“structures of access and exclusion are reconstrued in entirely nonarchitectural terms… and you enter and exit places not by physical travel, but by simply establishing and breaking logical linkages.” (Mitchell 21)

on “place” in cyberspace:  “A software ‘there’ can be a one-dimensional place in a screen-displayed text; a two-dimensional place to put things on a ‘desktop’ surface; a three-dimensional virtual room, storehouse, library, gallery, museum, or landscape; or even an n-dimensional place in an abstract data structure.” (Mitchell 22)

3.  Cyborg Citizens

nervous system/bodynet; eyes/television; ears/telephony; muscles/actuators; hands/telemanipulators; brains/artificial intelligence

video conferencing connections a “holes in space” (Mitchell 34)

new cyborg bodies need to “sense and act at a distance but… also remain partially anchored in their immediate surroundings. (The Neuromancer fantasy of cyberspace that totally masks physical space — and so produces completely disembodied electronic existence — represents a theoretical limit, not a practical condition.)” (Mitchell 43-44)

“Life in pre-cyborg places was a very different experience.  You really had to be there.” (Mitchell 44)

4.  Recombinant Architecture

façade/interface; bookstores/bitstores; stacks/servers; galleries/virtual museums; theaters/entertainment infrastructure; schoolhouses/virtual campuses; hospitals/telemedicine; prisons/electronic supervision programs; banking chambers/ATMs; trading floors/electronic trading systems; department stores/electronic shopping malls; work/net-work; at home/@home; decomposition/recombination; programmable places

“when telecommunication through lickety-split bits on the infobahn supplements or replaces movement of bodies along circulation paths, and when telepresence substitutes for face-to-face contact among the participants in activities, the spatial linkages that we have come to expect are loosened.  The constituent elements of hitherto tightly packaged architectural and urban compositions can begin to float free from one another, and they can potentially relocate and recombine according to new logics.” (Mitchell 104)

traditional architectural spaces will come to be understood as “sites where bits meet the body” (Mitchell 105) — is the same true of the geographical?

5.  Soft Cities

“In the early days of computer networks it seemed a slightly far-fetched metaphor to describe these sorts of interaction sites as ‘places,’ since bandwidth was narrow and communication was mostly restricted to typing and receiving text” (Mitchell 114).  But how much less far-fetched is it to describe a graphically-rendered image as a “place”?  Is a painting a place?

“And your physical location no longer mattered so much” (Mitchell 116).

“If I were to diagram these connections, I would have a kind of subway map of cyberspace” (Mitchell 118).

public/semi-public/private “spaces”

6.  Bit Biz

“It would be easy to miss the point by pushing this sort of analysis to its logical extreme and so concluding that cyberspace economic activity operates autonomously in its own realm — disconnected from material, place-based operations.  But bits often have value precisely because they tell us something about the material world and can usefully guide our actions in that world” (Mitchell 137).

“there are growing forces acting to decentralize economic activity.  Managers and professionals are increasingly able to scatter across the globe while reintegrating their activities through telecommunications.  The mobility of capital has been heightened.  A world economy can now function in real time.  Firms can maintain unity of management while decentralizing production and participating in markets worldwide.  At the same time, there are some vigorous centralizing forces.  Production processes remain ultimately dependent on appropriation and transformation of matter, so industrial locations are still largely determined by local availability of raw materials and access to labor markets.  Furthermore, the initial development of an advanced telecommunications infrastructure is likely to favor existing urban centers (with their high and profitable concentrations of information work) over small towns and remote areas.  In the end these opposing forces will have complex and socially differentiated effects on urban and regional development processes and on industrial, commercial, and residential locational patterns.  There is no simple formula.” (Mitchell 138) — perhaps, but some of this seems to have played out in the opposite fashion to what Mitchell seems to predict: those “raw materials” and “labor markets” are themselves what has most decentralized, as production and service jobs are increasingly outsourced; this is not a new  model at all, but a return to a colonialist model, in which raw materials and labor are in one (less-developed) place, while consumption is centered in another

on architects imagining new spaces for digital systems:  “From the sidelines, no doubt, technoromantic theoreticians will egg them on to Gibsonian gestures of dematerialization and radical renunciation of traditional architectural means, while materiality chauvinists will provide ringing denunciations of a world that they see going to hell in a handheld device.” (Mitchell 172) — are these the only options?  Is there no possible critique of “Gibsonian gestures of dematerialization” except the Luddite one?
