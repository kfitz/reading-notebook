Himmer, Steve. “The Labyrinth Unbound: Weblogs as Literature.” 2004. Into the Blogosphere: Rhetoric, Community, and Culture of Weblogs. Ed. Laura Gurak, et al. 24 September 2006. <http://blog.lib.umn.edu/blogosphere/labyrinth_unbound.html>


"Calling a weblog 'literary' does not require content that is about literature or even content that aims to be literature.  It is not an attempt at categorizing one weblog and its author as more worthwhile in a canonical sense than any other.  On the contrary, I propose that every weblog can be considered literary in the sense that it calls attention not only to what we read, but also to the unique way we read it.  The weblog is (to paraphrase Colin MacCabe) the performed result of a code of particular techniques, and this paper is an attempt to highlight the primary features of that code.  The weblog collapses many of the common assumptions made about texts, as it complicates the distinction between author and audience through the multivocality of both direct commenting, and the reader's ability to reorder the narrative in myriad ways.  Owing to its ongoing creation over an undefined period of time, the weblog becomes a text that constantly expands through the input of both readers and writers.  This absence of a discrete, 'completed' product makes the weblog as a form resistant to the commoditization either of itself, or of any one particular interpretation" (Himmer)

the blog as 'a distinctive literary and creative mode, something richer and more nuanced than viewing it as simply the outcome of a specific toolset or formal structure allows for.  The form's literariness, then, is not a quality achieved by some weblogs and lacking in others.... This literary nature of the weblog is instead the loose set of shared criteria that allows us to speak of a plurality of 'weblogs' in the first place" (Himmer)

quoting Meg Hourihan:  "'we're united by tools... These tools spit out our varied content in the same format -- archives, permalinks, time stamps, and date headers.' This definition is representative and typical in its focus on the stylistic and structural aspects of delivering content rather than the content itself" (Himmer)

"The difficulty of distinguishing the weblog from other writing, the importance of finding something other than specifics of content to unify such a variable form, the possibility for multiple authors and reader participation in the production of a text, and frequent updates with posts building on previous posts and counting on later ones rather than making entire argument within their confines:  these are all, she and I agree, crucial components of what makes a weblog a weblog" (Himmer)

"The novel, as Watt, Gallagher, and others have argued, is defined as much in how readers are trained to enter its shared codes as it is by the specific delivery of those codes.  Likewise, the weblog relies on particular codes enacted by both author and readers -- readers who become, in this case, secondary authors" (Himmer)

weblog "collapses form and matter" (Himmer)

"It is not, as Gallagher reminds us regarding the novel, simply a question of fact versus fiction, or true versus false.  Instead, the weblog is an engaged performance of these collapsed distinctions in which the personalized content, unique technical delivery system and specific set of codes through which authors and audience meet all interact to form an original project. // One element of that project is a less defined distinction between fact and fiction, or between stories and those who tell them.  Despite frequent and lingering questions about whether online voices are 'honest' or 'real,' and concerns about webloggers presenting themselves truthfully, the particular features of the weblog make these questions all but irrelevant in many cases" (Himmer)

the thing that's important is not the truth claims but the process of identification

"As Delacour continues with a discussion of Japanese written and oral languages in connection with his relationship with a woman named Ikuko, the reader is not focused on whether Ikuko (or Delacour, for that matter) is a 'real' person or not, but only with whether, as Tim O’Brien says of a true story, it 'makes the stomach believe'" (Himmer)

"writing on a weblog can only ever be read through the filter of the reader’s prior knowledge of the author. As one day’s posts build on points raised or refuted in a previous day’s, readers must actively engage the process of 'discovering' the author, and of parsing from fragment after fragment who is speaking to them, and why, and from where whether geographically, mentally, politically, or otherwise" (Himmer)

on Aarseth:  "cybertextuality and/or ergodicism is not in itself a genre or style, but rather a communicative strategy and a means of production—ergodicism relies on technique, not technology, and process rather than product"  (Himmer)

"The second time I open the novel, I will not find an additional chapter, character, or plotline added by Joyce since my previous reading. The topology of the text has been defined [and] remains consistent" (Himmer)

in ergodic work, "The text is reassembled -- thus rewritten -- through the interaction of author and reader with each performance" (Himmer)

"Cybertext is in many ways a literature of potentiality" (Himmer)

"Though a new text is, in the sense offered above, produced with each successive reading, all of the internal elements of the narrative are always already present.... Whereas the elements of time and change over time are relevant to my position as a reader, the physical text (notably distinct from the interpretive text) is impervious to the passage of time.... The interactive fiction, as a piece of cybertext or ergodic literature, remains restricted by its condition of completeness" (Himmer)

"Points of entry to a blog, whether via a link on another weblog, search engine results, a newspaper article, or an email, are for all intents and purposes infinite. In other words, the reader can open and begin reading the text—with which I refer to the weblog entire rather than specific, individual entries—at any point along the process of its production from the oldest, earliest post to the most current" (Himmer)

"Along with infinite points-of-entry, then, there are also multiple points of departure, each leading to another set of possible paths and exits, and those possible departures are still multiplying long after the initial post is written and shared" (Himmer)

"What matters isn’t that readers actually take advantage of all or any of the possible interactions offered to them, only that the potential to produce that infinite number of texts is available in ways impossible to other forms" (Himmer)

issue of time

"If we consider the weblog entire as a project rather than evaluate each post as a discrete unit, the difference between forms comes clear. There is no completion of a weblog—there is always the possibility, and usually the implied promise mentioned by Hourihan, of an additional post to come" (Himmer)

"The weblog offers the possibility of real-time conversation between authors" (Himmer)

"The weblog, though not universally or always intentionally, resists commoditization in a number of ways. The play of time, and change over time, make impossible the capture and containment of the weblog as a “complete” work—there is always more to come, so whatever particular fragment is torn from its context for commoditization or display necessarily and insistently refers to its own incompletion" (Himmer)

on the mixing of the personal and the public:  "this collapse serves, over time, to allow authors to develop and deepen the public persona presented through their work, incorporating more and more of the personality traits and quirks which would not, typically, emerge in public writing" (Himmer)

"The latitude allowed a weblogger, over time, to unfold the many aspects of his or her life and personality, and to do so in the same space in which they offer commentary on politics and culture, is a luxury not afforded to journalists or even novelists: discrete, commodifiable work requires a purpose, a point, or at the very least a markable focus. This is not to say, however, that the self presented on a weblog is a 'complete' or even an accurate one: just as in journalism, memoir, or fiction, decisions are made about what to include and what to exclude. The weblogger, in that sense, can be read as fictional, as a character, in precisely the same ways that Andy Rooney or James Joyce can be -- furthering the collapse between factual and fictional, public and private, and distinct genres in general" (Himmer)

"The weblog, as its detractors criticize, is often characterized by mundane, banal, sometimes embarrassing personal content ranging from what the author ate for lunch to specific health problems and sexual issues. This personal content, moreover, is frequently intermingled with commentary on politics or culture, making the personal, the public, and the political inseparable in precisely the ways the avant-garde demanded" (Himmer)

"webloggers engage politics not from the distant remove of traditional pundits, but rather from positions with high personal stakes" (Himmer)

"the focus is not the reaction such content garners from its reader, but rather on the reader understanding the reaction of the *writer*" (Himmer)

"It seems appropriate to end with that mention of authorial intentions, because as much diversity as there is among weblogs, at root they are all guided by those particular, individual intentions: without the hurdle of editors, publishers, and corporations between writers and “publication” in some form or another, weblog authors are able to write exactly what they want to, in exactly the way they prefer" (Himmer)
