Chappell, David L.  Inside Agitators:  White Southerners in the Civil Rights Movement.  Baltimore:  Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994.

Foreword, Clayborne Carson

doesn't romanticize sympathetic white southerners; shows complexity of motives

"Chappell recognizes that the experiences of these exceptional southern white radicals were less crucial to the success of the black movement than were the far more commonplace actions of southern white moderates.  The former had almost no influence in southern communities precisely because they were not in the mainstream of southern white opinion; the latter became an essential force for compromise between civil rights protesters and white segregationists." (xi)

"civil rights activists should not be seen as utopians, more concerned with moral consistency than with political efficacy.  They were accomplished strategists 'using force against enemies to achieve political ends.  The general philosophical question and the general historical tradition they were involved in was that of the just war, and the principles of the just war provide the best summary of the relationship they developed between ends and means'." (xii)

argues for a return to Gandhian/Kingian nonviolence

Preface

book attempting to counter myth that all white southerners were segregationists

"Through the mass media, northern liberals reassured themselves that vicious hatreds and prejudices were vestiges of the Old South, that Dixie remained underdeveloped in the twentieth century, clinging with recalcitrant desperation to outmoded notions.  We could not see that Bull Connor represented only one end of a spectrum of southern white opinion, that there were quieter but equally representative voices at the other end.  Nor could we see the vast middle, which was uncertain which way it was bieng led.  Seeing these complexities would make the South, which was a synonym for racial trouble, too much like our own complex reality.  Ignoring them was essential to the notion that racism was somebody else's problem." (xv)

Introduction

"This book is about the relationship between morality and politics.  Its central question is, how did a poor, disenfranchised minority with a political battle agains a majority that outvoted, outspent, and outgunned it?  The basic answer is that southern black leaders of the civil rights movement understood white southerners well enough to take advantage of covert white sympathy, and of fatal divisions among segregationists, in a wide variety of ways." (xxi)

"The more I studied the exceptional white southerners who out of a moral commitment actively aided the movement, the more my attention was drawn to a larger group who, without any moral commitment, found themselves compelled to break with the segregationists in order to restore social peace, a good business climate, or the good name of their city in the national headlines.  These middle-road southerners sought a quiet role for themselves, and when exposed, they were accused of violating the southern way of life and betraying their race.  Yet by their numbers and standing in the community, they undermined the credibility of their attackers. // I was discovering things about the white South that the civil rights movement had discovered long before.  Black southerners who joined the movement knew that the dominant ideology of their society, racism, was wrong, but they knew it was wrong in more than a moral sense.  They knew it was incorrect, in a factual sense.  White people did not stick together in their endorsement (or even in their definition) of racial separation, let alone in their willingness to defend it.  The black southern movement started by discerning the divisions in the white South and then set about widening them.  The black leaders won largely because they understood the white South better than the segregationists who claimed to be defending it." (xxii-xxiii)

"The civil rights movement never faced a simple choice between force and moral suasion because there was never a simple division between black and white.  A few white southerners were sickened by segregation.  Usually they were unable or unwilling to do anything to change it.  Many more white southerners endorsed segregation enthusiastically in principle yet found it terribly inconvenient in practice.  They too did nothing to change it.  Yet the knowledge that both groups of white southerners existed was the greatest moral and political resource the civil rights movement had:  each group wanted in one way or another to be pushed." (xxv)

Part One:  The Strange Career of Racial Dissent in the South

1.  The "Silent South":  The Founding Fathers of Southern White Dissent

must distinguish between liberal and racial dissenter; liberal seeks "formalized legal structure," education as means of progress, "uplift" to overcome moral problems; dissenter opposed "specific racist laws and policies," not general doctrine of racial inequality

dissent before the 1950s and 1960s never spread, but still conveyed message to southern black community about divisions in white community

Atticus Greene Haygood, president of Emory College, author of _Our Brother in Black, His Freedom and His Future_ (1881); accepted segregation but opposed disenfranchisement

Lewis Harvie Blair, Richmond businessman; economic argument for educating blacks; later reversed into support for disenfranchisement and segregation

George Washington Cable; New South program of urbanization and industrialization; moral argument combined with self-interest

all three held as trump card idea that "if you do not do what we good southerners say you should do, Sherman's army will march again." (11) - failed because ultimately the north did not care what the south did to or with its black population

such dissenters had to defend their Southern identities; did so through claims that the "black problem" was not created by the South, but now must be left to the South to solve; "who better to recommend the solution than one who could announce, 'I am the son and grandson of slaveholders,' moreover a 'citizen of an extreme Southern state, a native of Louisiana, an ex-Confederate soldire, and a love of my home, my city, and my state, as well as of my country'? [Cable]" (13)

dissenters also had to disavow notions of "social equality," separating ideas of enfranchisement or even integration from "intermixing"

effects of such early dissent were primarily confusion; listeners turned to the clearer ideas of the segregationists

background to Plessy v. Ferguson:  "Shortly after Louisiana passed an 'equal but separate' railroad law in 1890 (over the protests not only of organized black groups in New Orleans but also of the railroads), a young black attorney named Louis A. Martinet began developing a strategy for a test case to overturn the law.... The plaintiff was to be Homer Adolph Plessy, a man who, though legally a 'Negro,' appeared to be so white that Martinet had to enlist the cooperation of the East Louisiana Railroad even to detect his presence in the 'white' car and have him arrested.  Plessy's white appearance, Martinet and his associates believed, would strengthen their case for overturning the law." (19)  Alas, Martinet did not argue the case before SCOTUS himself; Samuel Field Phillips, who did, argued that "it was not proper for 'a statute to give *force of law* to mere social inequalities turning upon color'" (19).  Did not challenge laws against interracial marriage or school segregation (conceded state had some rights in familial matters), but argued that segregation in transportation was not right.  Result:  "Justice Henry Billings Brown, writing for the seven-to-one majority, decreed that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment 'could not have intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political, equality'" (20).

dissenting opinion:  Justice John Marshall Harlan.  "Harlan's main contribution was to put the focus where it belonged: repeal of the recently enacted railroad segregation law could hardly 'enforce' social equality, as Justice Brown's opinion for the majority suggested.  The legislation in question was designed to *create* social inequality.  It was segregation that was the positive act of law." (21)

dissent after Plessy became even more restricted and defensive:  "The utter hopelessness of moving the race question *in* the South reinforced the dissenters' sad, demoralized sense of fighting for another lost cause and impelled them to oscillate between two tactics.  The first tactic was to try to awaken what Cable had referred to as the 'silent South' - the 'better sort' out there who deplored racial oppression and violence.  The second was to try to attach themselves to an independent force, a force that would play the role 'northern capital' had played in the New South dreams of industrialization." (23)

2.  From Silence to Futility:  Southern White Dissent Gets Organized

southern white dissenters faced threats of losing their jobs; witness careers of professors Andrew Sledd (Emory College) and John Spencer Bassett (Trinity College, later Duke University)

early attempts at organizing:  Alabama's all-white Southern Society for the Promotion of the Study of Race Conditions and Problems in the South (a.k.a. the Montgomery Conference); the Race Relations Committee of the interracial Southern Sociological Conference; the University Commission on Southern Race Questions; the Southern Publicity Committee

Commission on Interracial Cooperation, founded 1919 by Will Alexander (Vanderbilt-educated Methodist minister); commission originated under War Department auspices, but focused on Southern leaders; members were "closet dissenters" (36), never publicized meetings, often endorsed segregation - focus was on challenging lynching (but also opposing the NAACP's calls for Congressional action)

CIC strategy was "to convince fellow white southerners 'that lynching hurt them more than blacks' and to offend white sensibilities as little as possible in the process" (38); also founded Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, which worked to prevent lynchings while opposing federal legislation

"Still, however heroically ASWPL members intervened in gathering mobs, they only opposed what was already against the law.  They left alone the broader system of institutionalized discrimination, of which lynching was but one of many techniques of enforcement" (39).

"Red-baiting increasingly threw southern white dissenters into attacks on other racial dissenters and diverted them from attacks on racist policies and practices.  Supporters of the system used red-baiting as a tactic to put its critics on the defensive." (41)

Southern Conference for Human Welfare, founded 1938, focused on changing the political structure of the south; campaign against the poll tax (tied to New Deal reforms)

Southern Regional Council, founded 1944, "aimed to fight racist propaganda and prepare southern opinion for gradual amelioration of black social conditions" (46); didn't oppose segregation, and so alienated some white liberals as well as some black leaders

Part Two:  The Strategy of Nonviolence and the Role of White Southerners in the Movement

3.  The Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956

Clifford and Virginia Durr, white lawyer and Democratic National Committeewoman; subpoenaed to appear in March 1954 before Senate Investigating Committee hearings in NOLA

SIC hearing led by Mississippi senator Jim Eastland, in an attempt to bring McCarthyism to the South; "Eastland, anticipating the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of the NAACP in the *Brown* decision (which was to come in May 1954), had vowed to fight the Court, which he characterized as a central part of the Communist Conspiracy" (54)

Durrs received no support from white friends in Alabama, and only letter of support was a telegram from a number of women they didn't know, who turned out to be educated black members of the Women's Political Council

"Through E. D. Nixon, Virginia Durr also met Rosa Parks, secretary of the local NAACP.  Durr hired Parks as a seamstress, and the two became friends" (54).  Durr sent Parks to Myles Horton's Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, a program influenced by the ideas of Jane Addams and John Dewey; there Parks developed and traded ideas about political action

Parks returned to Montgomery in July 1955, and on Dec. 1 refused a bus driver's order to give up her seat for a white man; a WPC member on the bus got off and told E. D. Nixon what happened.  Nixon called Clifford Durr, and they and Virginia went and posted Parks's bond

NAACP and WPC joined forces and asked black clergy to ask their congregations to boycott the buses; preachers and flocks came together to form Montgomery Improvement Association, with Martin Luther King, Jr. at head [not mentioned here that King had the year before talked with Baton Rouge minister Jemison about the BR boycott]

Rev. Robert Graetz, white pastor of all-black Trinity Lutheran Church, wasn't informed of boycott by his congregation, but knew Parks; gave sermon in support of boycott, and said that he'd drive boycotters around in his car; King recognized the role the white minister might play, and steered the press to him

"a White Citizens' Council bonfire [Graetz] had witnessed, in which two effigies, one black, one white, were burned.  The black one was labeled 'NAACP,' the white one, 'I talked integration'" (57)

Rev. Glenn Smiley, staff member of Fellowship of Reconciliation and early member of Congress of Racial Equality: "'I had two assignments with Dr. King,' Smiley said. 'One was every mass meeting in which I was in town, I was given a spot on the program to discuss tactical nonviolence.  Then, I was supposed to go around to the different churches and meet with small groups and try to whip the clergy and laity into line about nonviolence.  My other assignment was to make every contact possible in the white community and attempt to do the same thing, to get them to understand and try to meet with Negroes.'  In the latter capacity, Smiley says he acted as 'a sort of intelligence service as to what people, including the White Citizens' Council and others, were saying.  The fact that I was white and could speak and act like a southerner gave me access to public meetings of the WCC and even the Klan.'" (59-60)

"The support of these conscientious white southerners for the boycott was not, on the whole, very public.... This was not their movement.  They found themselves, so to speak, on the back of the historical bus.  It was no longer a matter of doing things for the Negroes, as they had been accustomed to doing.  The day they thought they were waiting for - the day when they would simply do things with the Negroes - had been passed over.  It seemed as though Negroes were now doing things for themselves, and even, in a sense, for the whites.  Now the only position the white dissenters could find themselves in, sometimes sheepishly, was to react to initiatives that rose more or less fully formed out of the black community." (61)

"One of the reasons segregation could not command wholehearted moral support was that, however rational and right most whites believed it to be in principle, obeying its rules on a day-to-day basis involved so many such contortions that southerners, never a punctiliously law-abiding people, got in the habit of winking at a humane bending of the rules now and then.  Another reason it could not command wholehearted support was that those who did rigorously uphold the rules were typically tiresome, if not cruel and unusual, types." (63)

"The motive behind much of the white help to carpooling - which white drivers did not always refer to, or even recognize, as such - was simple self-interest:  white women needed their maids and there was no other way to get them.  Such motivation did not, of course, bother the boycott leaders, who understood with Eliot that people can be counted on to do the right things for the wrong reasons.  But there is evidence that at least some of the white aid to the boycott was a deliberate and purposeful expression of support, if always given on the sly." (67)

WCC ad:  "'There are only two sides in the Southern fight - those who want to maintain the Southern way of life or those who want to mix the races.... Whites must stand by whites just as Negroes are standing by Negroes.... There is no middle ground for moderation...that middle ground has been washed away by the actions of the NAACP in seeking to destroy the freedoms of the Southern white man.'  This was typical of segregationist appeals.  The WCC and other such organizations called for unity among the white people, in increasingly exasperated tones, because no such unity existed." (71)

"The Durrs, Graetz, and Smiley had put themselves outside the 'power structure,' which defined itself, in those instances in which the civil rights movement faced resistance, as the guardian of segregation.  White southerners who turned against it were 'traitors' and could not be expected to provide inroads that might lead to compromise, or even reliable information about what the leaders of the power structure were planning to do." (72)

ways "get tough" plan of Montgomery police backfired (particularly when it led to bombings)

"The black movement's self-disciplined and dignified appeals to biblical and constitutional principles provided a stark contrast to the crassness and clumsiness of the segregationists.  The White Citizen's Council forced a polarization by taking an extreme and often wildly impulsive position.  That was a recipe for defeat.  The movement leaders, recognizing the inbred conservatism of white southerners, knew their only hope was to appear on the opposite side of disorder." (82)

4.  Tallahassee, 1956-1957

Before 1956, NAACP in Tallahassee was "small and weak," but so was White Citizen's Council, and the Klan was all but non-existent (84); Tallahasseeans' response to ideas of desegregation was very middle-of-the-road (preferred segregation, but very much on the side of law and order)

"On May 26, 1956, two students from the local black university, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical, refused a bus driver's order to give up their seats near the front of the bus.  They had apparently been invited to take those seats by a white lady.  Yet they were arrested, and their protest immediately provoked an extreme segregationist response." (86)

assumptions by segregationists (as in Montgomery as well) that the protests must have been organized by outside agitators, that "our Negroes" weren't unhappy

"The next day [Nov. 14], however, Mayor John Humphress asked both races to cooperate with the city in maintaining segregation.  He indicated a lack of confidence in the loyalty of his principal ally by calling on the bus company for help: the bus company had shown no inclination to abandon segregation before, but its willingness to flout the Supreme Court could not be assumed.  It was time to close ranks.  Two days later, the city commission held an emergency session at which it ordered the company to enforce segregation - on just what legal basis was not clear.  On December 26, the city commissioners suspended the company's operating franchise because, they said, Negroes were making efforts to integrate its operations.  The bus company announced that it would not respect the suspension.  On December 27 the City reacted by arresting not black passengers but the bus company manager, who had previously been one of the principal spokesmen for segregation, and nine bus drivers." (90-91)

shift in the governor's position from pro-segregation to pro-desegregation:  "Collins asked Floridians to start 'being honest' with themselves and recognize realities.  'Man's greatest failures have come when he has refused to admit the reality of a changes situation.  We should admit that our attitude toward the black populace generally in the past has been obstructive all along the line.'" (94)

"Collins was just another would-be white moderate who waited until the power of the civil rights movement made moderation possible.  Others like him existed all over the SOUth, and the movement used them elsewhere to achieve its ends." (96)

5.  Little Rock, 1957-1959
