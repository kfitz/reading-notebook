Wallace, David Foster. "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction." A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again. Boston: Little, Brown, 1997. 21-82.


title from Michael Sorkin's "Faking It," in Todd Gitlin, ed., _Watching Television_

TV created a nation of voyeurs?  No.  Levels of illusion that we're watching (?)

"the most dangerous thing about television for U.S. fiction writers is that we don't take it seriously enough as both a disseminator and a definer of the cultural atmosphere we breathe and process" (Wallace 27)

condition in which we "simultaneously hate, fear, and need television"; try to watch "with weary contempt instead of the rapt credulity most of us grew up with" (Wallace 29)

"if Realism called it like it saw it, Metafiction simply called it as it saw itself seeing itself see it.  This high-cultural postmodern genre, in other words, was deeply informed by the emergence of television and the metastasis of self-conscious watching.  And (I claim) American fiction remains deeply informed by television... especially those strains of fiction with roots in postmodernism, which even at its rebellious Metafictional zenith was less a 'response to' televisual culture than a kind of abiding-in-TV" (Wallace 34)

"guilty fictions" -- TV and American literature

Pynchon and DeLillo as "ahead of their time" -- "The U.S. generation born after 1950 is the first for whom television was something to be lived with instead of just looked at.  Our elders tend to regard the set rather as the flapper did the automobile:  a curiosity turned treat turned seduction" (Wallace 43)

younger writers as part of "the great U.S. Audience" (Wallace 44)

postmoderns (Gaddis, Barth, Pynchon) as "technologically literate," "citizens of a culture that said its most important stuff about itself via mass media" (Wallace 45)

"What distinguishes another, later wave of postmodern literature is a further shift from television-images as valid objects of literary allusion to television and meta-watching as themselves valid _subjects_.  By this I mean certain literature beginning to locate its raison in its commentary on/response to a U.S. culture more and mroe of and for watching, illusion, and the video image" (Wallace 46) -- prophet of this shift:  DeLillo

most-photographed barn in America:  barn as "an object of watching"; people watch barn; Murray watches people; Jack watches Murray; we watch Jack (Wallace 48)

"irony and ridicule" as part of the culture of watching; on the one hand, "entertaining and effective"; on the other, "they are agents of a great despair and stasis in U.S. culture, and that for aspiring fiction writers they pose especially terrible problems" (Wallace 49)

postmodern fiction attempting to "transfigure" the culture of watching; televisual culture is "invulnerable" to any such assault (Wallace 49-50)

"Image-Fiction" -- use of "real" characters in fiction (see _Libra_) -- "questioning the border of fact and fiction when in the presence of fame" (Michael Martone) -- "It is a natural adaptation of the hoary techniques of literary Realism to a '90s world whose defining boundaries have been deformed by electric signal" (Wallace 51)

"The reason why this irreverent postmodern approach fails to help the new Imagists transfigure TV is simply that TV has beaten the new Imagists to the punch" (Wallace 52) -- see Tabbi:  irony is now complicity, not rebellion

"as with television, whether we happen personally to love technology, hate it, fear it, or all three, we still look relentlessly to technology for solutions to the very problems technology seems to cause" (Wallace 57) -- see Postman

ironic distance and "cool" now part of system:  "'Television,' after all, literally means 'seeing far'; and our six hours daily not only helps us feel up-close and personal at like the Pan-Am Games or Operation Desert Shield but also, inversely, trains us to relate to real live person up-close stuff the same way we relate to the distant and exotic, as if separated from us by physics and glass" (Wallace 64)

irony has only negative function, and is "singularly unuseful when it comes to constructing anything to replace the hypocrisies it debunks" (Wallace 67)

"this is why the fiction-writing citizen of our televisual culture is in such very deep shit.  What do you do when postmodern rebellion becomes a pop-cultural institution?" (Wallace 68)

"The novels of Pynchon and DeLillo revolve metaphorically off the concept of interference:  the more connections, the more chaos, and the harder it is to cull any meaning from the sea of signal" (Wallace 73)
