Bérubé, Michael. “Harry Potter and the Power of Narrative.” The Common Review 6.1 (June 2007): 14-20.


"you can’t have narrative without temporality and causality. Temporality and causality are categories of mind, as Kant taught us. In Forster’s terms, to understand a story is to understand temporality; to understand a plot is to understand causality. And to understand the motive forces of narrative, I think, is to understand why we devise these plots about people and the things they do and the things that happen to them." (Bérubé 18)

"For our species’ long-running obsession with narratives about orphans is, in part, the sign of our inability to stop wondering about our beginnings—and about the narrative problem of how to begin; and, as Frank Kermode argued so brilliantly in _The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction_ (1967), we tell stories partly because we know we are going to die." (Bérubé 20)
