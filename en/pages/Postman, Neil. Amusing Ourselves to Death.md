Postman, Neil. Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. New York: Penguin Books, 1986.


Postman argues that TV culture has produced a profound shift in our epistemology -- truth is now resident in visuality rather than print (so TV is real in a way that novels are not) -- and this is bad

because 18th c. style "argument" or "discourse" cannot take place via images (rather than the linearity of words), image-based medai are inherently lesser for Postman

Orwell/Huxley:  "What Orwell feared were those who would ban books.  What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one" (Postman vii)

Postman seems to be suffering from the anxiety of obsolescence in a big way -- the typographic mind is better because that's what he has; the end of book culture seems a fearsome thing for him -- and something he seems to think is likely

p. 84:  technology (machine) v. medium (machine + codes; use to whoch physical apparatus is put)

bias of technology of television:  Fiske?  TV's invention cannot be looked at as devoid of intent

"the decline of American's moral and political prestige" (Postman 86)

[okay, I get it.  This guy is an incredible reactionary.  Why on earth do we suppose the US ever had moral prestige?  And why should we want it to?]

"what I am claiming here is not that television is entertaining but that it has made entertainment itself the natural format for the representation of all experience" (Postman 87)

"In New Bedford, Massachusetts, a rape trial was televised, to the delight of audiences who could barely tell the difference between the trial and their favorite mid-day soap opera" (Postman 94)

[1.  the soap opera reference makes it clear that he's talking about women, on some level; has it never occured to him that women might have some reason other than sensationalism to be interested in the trial?  2.  Please -- give these viewers a little credit:  they perfectly well can tell the difference between "reality" and "drama"]

"Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradictions and narcotized by technological diversions" (111) -- see Vineland; also Marie Minn -- TV as drug (metaphor brings illicitness, if not illegality; stigma of addiction; label of weakness in our 'just say no' world)
