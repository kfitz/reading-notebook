# Benjamin, Walter. “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.” *Illuminations*. New York: Schocken Books, 1969.  217-251.

## PREFACE

Marx’s critique of capitalism:  “one could expect it not only to exploit the proletariat with increasing intensity, but ultimately to create conditions which would make it possible to abolism capitalism itself.” (Benjamin 217)

change in means/conditions of production manifesting itself in change in culture

“The concepts which are introduced into the theory of art in what follows differ from the more familiar terms in that they are completely useless for the purposes of Fascism.  They are, on the other hand, useful for the formulation of revolutionary demands in the politics of art.” (Benjamin 218)

## I.

newness of mechanical reproduction of works of art

founding, stamping; woodcut; printing; lithography — “Lithography enabled graphic art to illustrate everyday life, and it began to keep pace with printing.” (Benjamin 219) — photography

photography freed hand of artist, to focus upon eye; photography foreshadowed sound film

about 1900, processes of reproduction advanced enough not only to reproduce all works of art, but to become an art form of its own

study of repercussion of reproduction of works of art and the art of film on more traditional art

## II.

“Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.” (Benjamin 220)

“authenticity”  — irreproducible; but in mechanical reproduction, original does not maintain its authority:  “First, process reproduction is more independent of the original than manual reproduction. . . . Secondly, technical reproduction can put the copy of the original into situations which would be out of reach for the original itself.” (Benjamin 220)

quality of presence of the original depreciated by existence of copies

authenticity = “the essence of all that is transmissible from its beginning, ranging from its substantive duration to its testimony to the history which it has experienced.” (Benjamin 221)

“that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of a work of art.” (Benjamin 221)

film’s “destructive, cathartic aspect”: “the liquidation of the traditional value of the cultural heritage” (Benjamin 221)

## III.

changes in human sense perception:  changes in contemporary perception = decay of the aura

aura = distance; social bases of decay of aura rest in increased importance of masses: desire of masses to bring things closer, to reproduce reality

“The adjustment of reality to the masses and of the masses to reality is a process of unlimited scope, as much for thinking as for perception.” (Benjamin 223)

## IV.

aura of work of art inseparable from its historical circumstances, but an aura nonetheless

“the existence of the work of art with reference to its aura is never entirely separated from its ritual function” (Benjamin 223-24); aura = cult value

with parallel rises of photography and socialism, art sensed coming revolution; responded with l’art pour l’art, “a theology of art” (Benjamin 224)

“for the first time in world history, mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual. . . . But the instance the criterion of authenticity ceases to be applicable to artistic production, the total function of art is reversed.  Instead of being based on ritual, it begins to be based on another practice — politics.” (Benjamin 224)

## V.

cult value v. exhibition value; as art is emancipated from ritual, exhibition possibilities increase

absolute emphasis on the exhibition value of a work of art has removed its artistic function?

## VI.

photography begins to replace cult value with exhibition value completely — but the portrait still maintains cult value

“photographs become standard evidence for historical occurrences, and acquire a hidden political significance.” (Benjamin 226)

photographs require captions, directives; film takes this further as each image is determined by those which have gone before

## VII.

“When the age of mechanical reproduction separated art from its basis in cult, the semblance of its autonomy disappeared forever.” (Benjamin 226)

disputes over whether or not photography is an art overlook the question of whether or not photography has transformed the very nature of art

desire among critics to class film among “arts” leads them to read ritual elements into it

## VIII.

differences in presentation of performances by stage and screen actors; mediation by camera

“The audience’s identification with the actor is really an identification with the camera.” (Benjamin 228)

audience takes role of critic; anathema to cult value

## IX.

actor acts not for audience, but for machine: “for the first time — and this is the effect of film — man has to operate with his whole living person, yet forgoing its aura.” (Benjamin 229)

“there is indeed no greater contrast than that of the stage play to a work of art that is completely subject to or, like the film, founded in, mechanical reproduction.” (Benjamin 230)

pastiche form of screen actor’s performance

## X.

transportation of screen actor’s image before public

“The film responds to the shriveling of the aura with an artificial build-up of the ‘personality’ outside the studio.  The cult of the movie star, fostered by the money of the film industry, preserves not the unique aura of the person but the ‘spell of the personality,’ the phony spell of a commodity.  So long as the movie-makers’ capital sets the fashion, as a rule no other revolutionary merit can be accredited to today’s film than the promotion of a revolutionary criticism of traditional concepts of art.” (Benjamin 231)

democratization of art: anyone can be filmed; readers can become writers; distinction between author and public loses its basic character

## XI.

viewer of the shooting of a film cannot avoid seeing machinery; in order to view it as equipment-free, another level of mechanization (editing) must intervene — height of artifice

difference between painter and cameraman as difference between magician (faith-healer) and surgeon

for contemporary man, representation of reality by film is more significant, since with film reality is more thoroughly permeated with machinery

## XII.

mechanical reproduction of art changes responses of masses to art, from reactionary to progressive

progressive reaction:  fusion of enjoyment and critical faculty; with less “social significance,” the separation between criticism and enjoyment becomes more distinct

film as collective experience; painting as solitary

## XIII.

film’s contributions to perception like those of Freudian theory; analysis of behavior in film more precise than in paintings or on the stage; “the mutual penetration of art and science” (Benjamin 236)

film explores a difference nature than the eye; “unconsciously penetrated space” (Benjamin 236)

## XIV.

“One of the foremost tasks of art has always been the creation of a demand which could only be fully satisfied later.” (Benjamin 237); Dadaism sought the effects now produced in film (destruction of the aura)

spectator’s process of association interrupted by changing images of film; shock effect

## XV.

quantitative change in participation in art has produced qualitative change

critical complaint about mode of reception of film: distraction rather than concentration

architecture always received distractedly; tactile v. optical reception

film develops reception in a state of distraction

## EPILOGUE

growing proletariat and increasing formation of masses can lead to revolution or fascism

“Fascism attempts to organize the newly created proletarian masses without affecting the property structure which the masses strive to eliminate.  Fascism sees its salvation in giving these masses not their right, but instead a chance to express themselves. . . . The logical result of Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life.” (Benjamin 241) — using apparatus to produce ritual values

“All efforts to render politics aesthetic culminate in one thing: war.” (Benjamin 241)

“The destructiveness of war furnishes proof that society has not been mature enough to incorporate technology as its organ, that technology has not been sufficiently developed to cope with the elemental forces of society.” (Benjamin 242)
