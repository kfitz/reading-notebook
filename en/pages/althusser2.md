## ON THE REPRODUCTION OF THE CONDITIONS OF PRODUCTION

"The ultimate condition of production is...the reproduction of the conditions of production."

social formations as arising form mode of production; social formation must produce productive forces and relations of production

reproduction of the means of production

reproduction of labor power:  includes reproduction of "productive forces":  wages; reproduction of skills: education; school = knowledge, but also "rules" -- learn to respect division of labor and class structure; reproduction of submission to ruling ideology; school, church, army teach know-how in forms which ensure subjection to the ruling ideology

reproduction of the relations of production

## INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPERSTRUCTURE

society = infrastructure (economic base) + superstructure (politico-legal & ideological)

topography; superstructure requires infrastructure; effects of spatial metaphor

take point of view of reproduction

## THE STATE

Marx/Lenin:  state as a repressive apparatus enabling capitalist exploitation

descriptive theory as first stage -- must go beyond to development of "true" theory

must add to definition of State as State apparatus; must distinguish between State power and State apparatus; apparatus can survive events which affect possession of power

Marxist theory of the State:  1. State = State apparatus; 2. State power ≠ State apparatus; 3. objective of class struggle: State power; 4. proletariat must seize State power in order to first alter State apparatus and second destroy the State

(repressive) State Apparatus versus Ideological State Apparatuses

RSA = army, police, courts, prisons; functions by violence; ISA = religion, education, family, legal, politics, unions, *communications*, culture

differences between RSA and ISA: singular v. plural; public v. private (though public/private is a distinction of bourgeois law)

main distinction:  RSA functions by violence; ISA functions by ideology (both use both repression and ideology, but each uses one more predominantly)

complex interweavings of RSA and ISA may be formed

diverse ISAs unified by fact of functioning ideologically, since ideologies are always unified beneath the ruling ideology

no class can hold power very long without a hegemony of the ISAs

ISAs as stake and site of class struggle:  former ruling classes can maintain strong power over ISAs; repressed classes can find vehicles for expression in ISAs

what is the extent of the role of the ISAs?

## ON THE REPRODUCTION OF THE RELATIONS OF PRODUCTION

secured by RSA and ISAs: RSA secures by force the political conditions of the relations of production; RSA also secures via repression the political conditions for action of ISAs, which largely secure the reproduction of the relations of production

changing roles of ISAs -- in pre-capitalist period, Church was dominant ISA; French Rev. attacked Church; bourgeoisie installed new political ISA to ensure ideological hegemony necessary to maintain capitalist relations of production

now, education is dominant ISA; why is education dominant?  1. All ISAs contribute to reproduction of relations of production; 2. Each does so in its own way; 3. All follow ruling ideology; 4. Schools are dominant

all children enter ed. system at same time; released at varying times; each group receives proper ideology for its role in society

no other ISA is both obligatory and free -- gets all childrem

ideological purpose of education is covered by an ideology of the School which represents the School as ideology-free

crises in families and schools are political crisis

## ON IDEOLOGY

Marx:  ideology = system of ideas and representations which dominate the mind of a man or group

ideology has no history:  ideology v. ideologies (specific ideologies always reflect class positions)

ideology = bricolage (for Marx); history is outside it (that of concrete indiv.)

ideology is nothing, pure dream; ideology has no history; ideology linked to the unconscious; ideology is eternal

"ideology is a "representation" of the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence"

ideology = illusion/allusion -- to be interpreted (mechanistic/hermeneutic)

"why do men 'need' this imaginary transposition of their real conditions of existence in order to 'represent to themselves' their real conditions of existence?" (163)  1.  because of the lies priests and despots use to control the individual; 2. because of the material alienation in the conditions of existence

relation is *imaginary*

ideology has a material existence (as opposed to ideal or spiritual); an ideology always exists in an apparatus and its practice(s) -- a material existence

beliefs are chosen by the individual as subject; individual participates in ISA; subject must act according to his beliefs (put ideology into practice) -- therefore, the ideas of a human subject exist in his actions (practices within an ISA)

there is no non-ideological practice; there is no non-subject-oriented ideology

ideology interpellates individuals as subjects: subject as constitutive category of ideology -- only insofar as the function of ideology is "constituting" individuals as subjects

always-already subjects

interpellation = hailing (Lacan); in recognizing that one has been hailed, one becomes subject

all ideology believes itself to be outside ideology (A. considers scientific knowledge to be "outside ideology" -- is this not proof of the ideological nature of science?)

mirror structure of all ideology -- a double structure; ensures:  "1. the interpellation of 'individuals' as subjects; 2. their subjection to the Subject; 3. the mutual recognition of subjects and Subject, the subjects' recognition of each other, and finally the subject's recognition of himself; 4. the absolute guarantee that everything really is so, and that on condition that the subjects recognize what they are and behave accordingly, everything will be all right" (181)

two meanings of subject:  free subjectivity; a subjected being

## P.S.

reproduction of the relations of production only realized within the processes of production; made possible by ISAs

reproduction of the relations of production are a class undertaking

State and Apparatuses only have meaning in the class struggle

ideology is realized in the installation of ISAs and so becomes the ruling ideology (class struggle in the ISAs)

## my afterthoughts:

The change that occurs between the earlier essays ("Marxism and Humanism" and "Contradiction and Overdetermination") and the ISA essay is a reduction of complexities to what has been labeled a "vulgar materialism."  In the earlier essays, Althusser puts forward that ideology is not determined by a simple correspondence to the "general contradiction" -- that of class -- but is rather "overdetermined" (from Freud) by a multiplicity of contradictions -- not simply class, but also race, gender, language, religion, etc.  Thus, ideology is not determined by a simple functioning of the base, but rather a complex functioning of the superstructures.  Indeed, in the earlier essays, his use of "ideology" is purposefully disconnected from the earlier, Sartrian connections of "ideology" with "false consciousness" (and thus ideology as a beautiful lie told by the ruling classes to keep the subordinate in line).  Ideology is, instead, a whole complex of multiple systems of representation which describe the imaginary relations of men and women to their real, lived conditions of existence.  However, by the time we reach the ISAs essay, all of this complexity and multiplicity has been reduced.  Ideology has become the dominant ideology.  The function of the superstructures has become, paradoxically, no more than to support the base (in that their production of "ideology" is put solely to the purpose of reproducing the current relations of production, and thus the capital/labor contradiction).  The multiplicity of contradictions which overdetermine ideology has been reduced to the general contradiction of class.  And, whereas there had previously been room for "residual" and "emergent" voices within the superstructure (as the superstructure was not so strictly controlled by the base), these voices are all but replaced by the self-replicating machine of the ISAs.

So the weakness of Althusser, especially the late Althusser, is that there is no room for human agency -- experience is, for Althusser, not the "ground" of study which it is for Williams, but instead something that cannot exist outside the structures which have been read into us, which determine the subject's ideology in a quite rigid fashion.  However, the parallel weakness of Williams seems to be the assumption that there is some field of the "real" which can be viewed outside ideology
