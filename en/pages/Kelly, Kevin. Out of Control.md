1.  The Made and the Born

“The realm of the born — all that is nature — and the realm of the made — all that is humanly constructed — are becoming one.  Machines are becoming biological and the biological is becoming engineered.”  (Kelly 1)

clockwork logic v. bio-logic; traits of living being imported to machine systems:  “self-replication, self-governance, limited self-repair, mild evolution, and partial learning” (Kelly 2)

bio-/genetic engineering = appropriation to life of traits of machine systems

overlap of words (mechanical/life) is increasing; “beyond semantics, two concrete things are happening:  (1) Human-made things are behaving more lifelike, and (2) life is becoming more engineered.  The apparent veil between the organic and the manufactured has crumpled to reveal that the two really are, and have always been, of one being.” (Kelly 3)

“vivisystems” (Kelly 3)

“The world of the made will soon be like the world of the born:  autonomous, adaptable, and creative but, consequently, out of control.  I think that’s a great bargain.” (Kelly 4)

2.  Hive Mind

the idea of “the collective hive as an animal” (Kelly 5) — bee hive as model of collectivity

“It’s an election hall of idiots, for idiots, and by idiots, and it works marvelously.  This is the true nature of democracy and of all distributed governance.” (Kelly 7)

“One is definitely aware of another intelligence online:  it’s this hollering mob.” (Kelly 8)

“A flock is not a big bird.” (Kelly 10); “The flock is more than the sum of the birds.” (Kelly 10)

“emergent” properties of superorganisms (hives; see Wheeler) — holistic behavior emerging from and superseding individual behaviors

“The hive possesses much that none of its parts possesses.” (Kelly 12)

“And for that matter, what is contained in a human that will not emerge until we are all interconnected by wires and politics?  The most unexpected things will brew in this bionic hivelike supermind.” (Kelly 13)

study of nature of human memory:  “The system by which knowledge is sequestered in our brain became more than just an academic question as computer scientists tried to build an artificial intelligence.  What is the architecture of memory in a hive mind?” (Kelly 15)

past idea:  “a single location for each archived item, with multiple cross-referencing, such as in libraries” (Kelly 15)

“But the current view of cognitive science leans more toward a new image:  memories are like emergent events summed out of many discrete, unmemory-like fragments stored in the brain.  These pieces of half-thoughts have no fixed home; they abide throughout the brain.” (Kelly 16)

“Memory, then, must organize itself in some way to accommodate more possible thoughts than it has room to store.” (Kelly 17)

“Our consciousness creates the present, just as it creates the past, from many distributed clues scattered in our mind.” (Kelly 17)

“The act of perceiving and the act of remembering are the same.  Both assemble an emergent whole from many distributed pieces.” (Kelly 17-18)

“A hive mind is a distributed memory that both perceives and remembers.  It is possible that a human mind may be chiefly distributed, yet, it is in artificial minds where distributed thought will certainly prevail.” (Kelly 19)

benefit of distributed mind:  “greater immunity to disruption” (Kelly 19)

parallel computing

“‘We are not stuff that abides, but patterns that perpetuate themselves,’ wrote Norbert Wiener.” (Kelly 20)

“More is different.” (Kelly 20)

two ways to construct “moreness”:  sequential (clockwork) or parallel (network) — though more of a continuity than a binary; “It seems that the things we find most interesting in the universe are all dwelling near the web end.” (Kelly 21)

weblike systems belong to class “variously called:  networks, complex adaptive systems, swarm systems, vivisystems, or collective systems.” (Kelly 21)

members of weblike systems are largely autonomous, “highly connected to each other, but not to a central hub” (Kelly 22)

benefits of swarm systems:  adaptable, evolvable, resilient, boundless, novelty

“apparent disadvantages” (Kelly 23):  nonoptimal, noncontrollable, nonpredictable, nonunderstandable, nonimmediate

“For each step we push our machines toward the collective, we move them toward life.  And with each step away from the clock, our contraptions lose the cold, fast, optimal efficiency of machines…. The more we can discover about the mathematical properties of generic swarm processing, the better our understanding will be of both artificial complexity and biological complexity.” (Kelly 24)

“Swarm logic tries to comprehend the out-of-kilter, to measure the erratic, and to time the unpredictable.  It is an attempt, in the words of James Gleick, to map ‘the morphology of the amorphous’ — to give a shape to that which seems to be inherently shapeless.” (Kelly 25)

Net replaces Atom as symbol of science for the new century:  “The Net is the archetype — always the same picture — displayed to represent all circuits, all intelligence, all interdependence, all things economic and social and ecological, all communications, all democracy, all groups, all large systems.” (Kelly 25)

emergence of “swarm being” through the Net:  “Hidden in the Net is the mystery of the Invisible Hand — control without authority.” (Kelly 26) — [this guy is no posthumanist!  He’s no revolutionary!  He’s Adam Smith with a PDA.]

“A network swarm is all edges and therefore open ended any way you come at it.  Indeed, the network is the least structured organization that can be said to have any structure at all.  It is capable of infinite rearrangements, and of growing in any direction without altering the basic shape of the thing, which is really no outward shape at all.” (Kelly 26)

“In fact, a plurality of truly divergent components can only remain coherent in a network.  No other arrangement — chain, pyramid, tree, circle, hub — can contain true diversity working as a whole.  This is why the network is nearly synonymous with democracy or the market.” (Kelly 27) [!!!]

“A distributed, decentralized network is more a process than a thing.  In the logic of the Net there is a shift from nouns to verbs.” (Kelly 27)

“Nets have their own logic, one that is out-of-kilter to our expectation.  And this logic will quickly mold the culture of humans living in a networked world.  What we get from heavy-duty communication networks, and the networks of parallel computing, and the networks of distributed appliances and distributed being is Network Culture.” (Kelly 28)

Alan Kay argued that “the personally owned book was one of the chief shapers of the Renaissance notion of the individual, and that pervasively networked computers will be the main shaper of humans in the future.  It’s not just individual books we are leaving behind, either.  Global opinion polling in realtime 24 hours a day, seven days a week, ubiquitous telephones, asynchronous e-mail, 500 TV channels, video on demand:  all these add up to the matrix for a glorious network culture, a remarkable hivelike being.” (Kelly 28)

“As we wire ourselves up into a hivish network, many things will emerge that we, as mere neurons in the network, don’t expect, don’t understand, can’t control, or don’t even perceive.  That’s the price for any emergent hive mind.” (Kelly 28)

3.  Machines with an Attitude

Mark Pauline and the Survival Research Labs (SRL)

making autonomous machines:  Rodney Brooks, “Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control”

should not be centralized (brain model) but decentralized (small neurons) — start with simple actions, and build on them

Daniel Dennett:  arguing against brain model of consciousness, suggesting that consciousness is instead emergent and distributed

Marvin Minsky, “society of mind”:  mind is built from small separate parts, each of which is mindless, with some goal or instinct; intelligence is in the arrangement of the parts
