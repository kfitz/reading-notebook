"Despite the extensive body of international research demonstrating the interdependence of the message and the medium, the conviction that a literary text is a creative entity which will remain substantially the same, no matter what physical or paratextual form it is given, remains solidly fixed.  This idea is so deeply rooted that editors and publishers often feel no compunction in altering the alphabetic code, establishing with this supposed hierarchies of importance in which they judge one text to be a main text, flanked with other secondary texts comprising dedications, forewords, afterwords, titles, notes, and so on." (Toschi 169)

"Anyone who comments on or promotes a text rewrites that text, this we have known for a long time.  What is new now is that the means of rewriting available to promotion or criticism of a book, be the criticism favorable, unfavorable, or backhanded, have by now become very powerful and they dominate the expressive universe of paper.  The only hope for paper is that it has some concrete possibility of fighting back with the passage of time." (Toschi 172)

"What is new is the language of this paratext as we may perceive it today in 1995.  Which is to say that today the paratext has at its disposition instruments which are enormously more efficient and far-reaching than in the past.  Our present society is a society based on information (leaving aside, for the moment, the quality of this information), and within this society the relationship between data and the communication of this data has become increasingly troubled.  Even the encounter between author and reader now has different characteristics from in the past." (Toschi 174)

"Writers, when faced with the evaporation of the automatic codes of understanding with their readers as a result of any audience being admitted to culture for the first time, want to make sure that they will not be misunderstood and thus want to provide notes and glosses, endless explanations, and thus to guide the text through that social and economic fabric which will remain extraneous to them." (Toschi 196) -- so what's changed is not technology but the opening-up of the audience that technology and political/social change make possible

"The realization that texts are written for a much wider world than that which existed prior to the major political upheavals of the late eighteenth century and that they must journey through universes of a communication the mechanisms of which cannot be foreseen creates almost by backlash the need for writers to safeguard their personal history, the history of their writing desk, of their own creative workshop.  Since it is not possible to control the users of the text, writers seem to feel a pressing need, perhaps as a form of compensation, to leave behind them an archive, orderly or chaotic, perhaps to entrust it to friends or to some institution or simply to the vagaries of fortune." (Toschi 197)

"As we come closer to the modern age, the manuscript has been experiencing a new spring.  Writing has become more and more to be used as a means for self-analysis, for progressive clarification on the part of the writer.  The various papers which have accompanied a writer on the journey toward a final version contain a personal experience of which it is very difficult for a writer to let go." (Toschi 198)

"Printed words are granted the special nature of being definite, of being unchangeable, whereas private words are imbued with the special charm which is associated with creativity in action, in its coming into being, from ideas seeking things and which, because these things are provisional, draw from things the energy needed to renew themselves and further knowledge.  The last traces of a culture unwilling to grant full literary status to the 'becoming' of a text... have made general the use of expressions such as 'rough copy,' 'draft,' 'jottings' which clearly indicate just how far we still have to go." (Toschi 200)

"The true task, apart from the not inconsiderable theoretical and operational differences, is to return to the fixity of a written text a third dimension, of movement and of transformation." (Toschi 200)
