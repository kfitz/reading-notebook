Snow, C. P.  The Two Cultures:  And a Second Look.  New York:  Cambridge University Press, 1963.


I.  The Two Cultures

Snow seens himself as moving between two groups which have "ceased to communicate at all" (Snow 10)

"I believe the intellectual life of the whole of western society is increasingly being split into two polar groups" (Snow 11)

literary intellectuals v. scientists -- total lack of understanding between

"non-scientists" (note neg. term) think scientists are overly optimistic braggarts; scientists think literary intellectuals are lacking in foresight and extremely narrow-thinking

attitude of literary intellectuals as "anti-scientific," as though scientism is something that has been proven to be true, and the literary intellectuals are refusing to accept it

the scientific culture "contains a great deal of argument, usually much more rigorous, and almost always at a higher conceptual level, than literary persons' arguments" (Snow 18)

"morality" and science become equated (Snow 19)

"It is bizarre how very little of twentieth-century science has been assimilated into twentieth-century art" (Snow 22)

[has that assimilation since been in reaction to his argument?]


II.  Intellectuals as Natural Luddites

resistances of traditional intellectuals to the industrial revolution -- see Eric Ashby, _Technology and the Academics_


III.  The Scientific Revolution

electronics and atomics begin new revolution

lack of understanding of industrial society by literary intellectuals

need for changing "education" (which seems to mean math and science)


IV.  The Rich and the Poor

"Somehow we've made ourselves believe that the whole of technology was a more or less incommunicable art" (Snow 47)

traditional culture also equated with imperialism, while scientists "are freer than most people from racial feeling" (Snow 50)


The Two Cultures:  A Second Look

response to criticism (esp. F. R. Leavis); by "culture" he meant "intellectual development"

"third culture" in the natural sciences?

scientific revolution seen as means to closing gap between rich and poor -- in fact, it is seen as the *only* means

industrial revolution as "first wave" of scientific revolution (Snow 75); is this where Toffler's "third wave" developed from?

%% the entire thing feels awfully scattered, and I get the distinct sense from his "second look" that Snow thinks he's said something completely different from what I think he's actually said.
