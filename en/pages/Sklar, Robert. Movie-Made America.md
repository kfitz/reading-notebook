Sklar, Robert.  Movie-Made America: A Cultural History of American Movies.  1975. rev.ed. New York: Vintage, 1994.


PREFACE

“motion pictures in their largest sense, as a mass medium of cultural communication.” (Sklar ix)

topics: “the invention of motion-picture technology; the nature and evolution of the motion-picture audience; the organization and business tactics of the movie trade; the design and economics of theaters; the social and professional livees of movie workers; government policies toward movies, and the attitudes and strategies of censorship groups; and the cultural influence of movies at home and overseas.” (Sklar ix)

thesis: “movies have historically been and still remain vital components in the network of cultural communication, and the nature of their content and control helps to shape the character and direction of American culture as a whole.” (Sklar x)

movies as first medium controlled by men with different ethnic and religious backgrounds from traditional cultural elites

I.  THE RISE OF MOVIE CULTURE
CHAPTER 1: THE BIRTH OF A MASS MEDIUM

movies as first of the modern mass media

transformation of U.S. into “predominantly urban industrial society” (Sklar 3) coincides with years of development of motion pictures — 1890–1910 (see Sister Carrie)

cities increasingly segregated by class; origins of film in working-class entertainment

development of technology:  Étienne-Jules Marey (Fr. scientist), Eadweard Muybridge (Am. photographer), Thomas Edison (kinetoscope), William K. L. Dickson (mutoscope)

“myth of total cinema” — André Bazin

explosion of nickel theaters in working-class neighborhoods

CHAPTER 2: NICKEL MADNESS

appearance of storefront movie theaters went unnoticed by middle-class press — nearly two years passed (1905–1907) before news reached middle-class

outcry against movies by reformers — want to control sources of info & entertainment of lower classes

developing  movies: audiences excited by scenes never before seen in a theater

Alfred Clark — lit on film’s ability to show dangerous, fantastic, etc. up close but at safe remove

Georges Méliès — film explicitly a medium for magical entertainment; “Anything at all could happen in a Méliès film, but he never permanently violated the moral or physical order of everyday life.” (Sklar 22)

about 1900, beginning to risqué films

Edwin S. Porter (filmmaker at Edison Co.) — The Great Train Robbery, the first classic of American movies; Porter demonstrated many of what were to become basic film techniques, but remained a technician

Pathé Frères (Fr.) — until WWI the world’s largest motion-picture producer

distinctiveness of movies in providing info and entertainment to an audience that didn’t need English

institutions of social contral (see Althusser?) decide to take over — since producers were WASPs, went after immigrant exhibitors

producers consented to developing a regulatory body: the New York Board of Motion Picture Censorship (became the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures)

middle class became excited about possibility of gaining control of movies — but power passed to immigrant ethnic groups

CHAPTER 3: EDISON’S TRUST AND HOW IT GOT BUSTED

“before 1910 the movies were as completely in the hands of respectable, established Anglo-Saxon Protestant Americans as they were ever to be.” (Sklar 33)

3 most important NY companies in 1st decade: Vitagraph, Biograph, Edison

Edison’s trust: Motion Picture Patents Company, founded Dec. 1908 — greed! — with 9 production cos. (Edison, Biograph, Vitagraph, Essanay, Kalem, Selig, Lubin, Pathé Frères, and Méliès) and 1 importer (George Kleine)

1915, Trust busted; but essentially dead by 1912

Trust’s techniques of exclusion and harassment fostered opposition

control of industry passed to immigrant-owned “independents”

by 1912, imdependents produced 50% of films (and 100% of features of 3 reels or more)

important names: Carl Laemmle (founded Imp), Kessel and Baumann (New York Motion Picture Compnay, Powers — 3 together formed Motion Picture Distributing & Sales Co. (1910) — split in 1912 to form Mutual Film Corporation (Kessel and Baumann) and Universal Film Manufacturing Co. (Laemmle and Powers)

independents developed “star” system, led talent away from Trust

first titans of “new” film industry: William Fox and Adolph Zukor — Fox developed “vertical integration”; Zukor (w/ Loew) appealed to middle-class audience

Zukor formed Famous Players Film Co. (1912); Jesse L. Lasky & Samuel Goldwyn formed Lasky Co.

to attract middle-class — fancier theatres:  S. L. “Roxy” Rothapfel

“Although American movies won new patronage from the middle classes, their prosperity continued to rest on a foundation of working-class support.” (Sklar 45)

“But the possibility of restoring cultural unity to American society through movies had slipped beyond the reach of the middle class.  If anyone had the power to forge such a unity, it was the producers, many of them foreign-born Jewish immigrants, and their efforts would be not in the name of high culture but rather of mass entertainment.” (Sklar 46)

movie “moguls” — seen as “part splendid emperors, part barbarian invaders” (Sklar 46)

By end of WWI, U.S. produced 85% of films shown world-wide and 98% of films shown in U.S.

CHAPTER 4:  D. W. GRIFFITH AND THE FORGING OF MOTION-PICTURE ART

use of cinematic techniques in modernism: Bergon, Stein, Picasso, etc.

can art be created in a setting where profit is still the primary goal?

can the movies themselves — as opposed to filmic techniques used in other art forms — be art?

D. W. Griffith — Hollywood morality tale

D. W. Griffith “found his inspiration for moving freely through space and time not from Mary, Queen of Scots and The Great Train Robbery, but in the traditional novel and epic poem.” (Sklar 51)

went to work for Biograph, which had “pioneered in the separation and specialization of filmmaking tasks” (Sklar 52) — director responsible for continuity

florid story-telling style

working-class and minorities in Griffth films endowed with humanity, often heroes

“Unlike his predecessors, he understood that each new technique was not merely an attention-getting device but a sign, a way of communicating, a like in a chain of cinematic discourse.  He was the first to forge them into a complete and original style of moving images.” (Sklar 54)

broke out from Biograph restrictions with 4-reel Judith of Bethulia

experimented with cutting and assembling of shots; ten years later, Eisenstein named process montage

“Griffith was the first artist of the moving image, the first to reproduce on the screen a complete world, the likes of which no one had ever seen before.” (Sklar 56)

The Birth of a Nation — “In theme, form and price it was meant to appeal to the American elite, to community leaders and opinion makers.” (Sklar 58)

is it “a work of racist propaganda or of consummate artistic skill?” (Sklar 60) — “as the didactic purpose of a film becomes more evident, its artistry is undeniably compromised.” (Sklar 60)

“Insofar as aesthetic judgements can even be separated from moral choices, The Birth of a Nation seems as remarkable, and as flawed, in its art as in its theme of white supremacy.” (Sklar 61)

Intolerance — mega-epic; spent probably a million $ — massive failure

expected it to appeal to same elites as B of N, not realizing that these elites supported the reformers the film criticizes

II. THE MOVIES IN THE AGE OF MASS CULTURE
CHAPTER 5: HOLLYWOOD AND THE DAWNING OF THE AQUARIAN AGE

movie people left immigrant identities behind and moved west, where they “gave form to a platonic conception of themselves called Hollywood.” (Sklar 67)

myth of Hollywood v. actual development — grew for reasons of ideal weather; proximity to mountains, desert, city, sea; L.A. as non-union city

Laemmle founded Universal City

moneymen remained East; creative went West; created tensions

By early 1920s, Hollywood as place, people, state of mind

antipathy between Los Angelenos and movie people

huge $ to be made; stars begin to demand more

but no one knew what made a star — by 1915, floods of people (mostly young women) seeking fame

“the motion-picture studios in the 1910s and 1920s gave more opportunities to women than most other industries, far more than they ever did again.” (Sklar 75)

exposés of “casting couch” as warning to young women (fears for middle-class daughters)

“Aquarian Age” — rise of “star” culture — cult of the body, beauty and health — great wealth

“Americans had alwyas been of mixed minds about great wealth.  They agreed it was a desirable goal, but they feared the temptations that came with the power of money — the release if gave from ordinary social restraints.” (Sklar 77)

scandals!  Fatty Arbuckle, etc. — exposés in the name of “the protection of American youth” — “the first faint recognition that moviegoers responded less to stories and scenes than to the presence of actors and actresses on the screen . . . the players, in other words, were more real to the audiences than the characters they portrayed.” (Sklar 79) — see Stanley Cavell on actress v. character

“There is no way to show a cause-and-effect relation between Hollywood’s pleasure principle and the gradual loosening of sexual restraints in American life . . . But Hollywood’s sexual behavior was the most publicized frontier of a new morality — or lack of one — during the 1920s” (Sklar 81–82)

drop in attendance in 1922 — due to radio? (commercial radio began broadcasting in 1920)

new trade association: MPPDA; new president: Will H. Hays (Harding’s postmaster general)

labor disputes — led to Studio Basic Agreement in 1926; formed Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1927 (with branches for actors, writers, directors, producers, technicians)

1926 — 1st sound film

CHAPTER 6: THE SILENT FILM AND THE PASSIONATE LIFE

silent film “was born, flourished, and died within a span of less than twenty years.” (Sklar 86)

movies unique among the arts in expectation of profit — “The almost undiluted commercialism of motion-picture production was a constant source of exasperation to critics and reviewers in the silent era” (Sklar 87)

Benjamin — mechanical reproduction as decisive force in “shattering cultural tradition and creating new cultural forms.” (Sklar 87)

movies as “instruments of social transformation” (Sklar 88) — role in destroying old cultural forms and creating new ones

David Robinson: movies as conspiracy to produce false image of life in the ’20s (portraying only upper- and upper-middle classes) — but ignores fact that American society and culture changed faster than movies; traditional middle-class moral order falling away

for members of dominant order, movies seemed in direct opposition to American values; but movies were made by men committed to capitalist values which were part of dominant order

fragmenting of American public after WWI; moviemakers’ mandate to produce largest possible audience led to uncontroversial subjects and treatments that “pleased the most and alienated the fewest. . . . What they [producers] became adept at was reformulating older conventions; only when the need way obvious and overwhelming did they dare generate a new formula.” (Sklar 91)

Cecil B. DeMille — most success in “transforming” social codes — gave “familiar topics a treatment that precisely suited audience desires in the immediate aftermath of the war.” (Sklar 94) — but does not violate (or even question) basic morals.

Am. audiences desired vicarious guilt and retribution of violating social code — Europeans! allowed to be sensual, expressive, even evil — see Erich von Stroheim, Rudolph Valentino

Europeans=passion — development of James’s international theme?

Europeans flocked to Hollywood:  Lubitsch, Negri, Jannings; Veidt; Leni, Dupont, Murnau; Fejos, Banky; Feyder; Stiller, Sjöström, Garbo

Europeans reaction to characterization? drawn to films to see epitome of American life: movement

European audiences first to recognize comedians as artists

CHAPTER 7:  CHAOS, MAGIC, PHYSICAL GENIUS AND THE ART OF SILENT COMEDY

conservative elite roots of Am. comic tradition — adopting persona to ridicule group from “inside — aimed at social control

“movies direct their comic ridicule and aggression outward as well as inward — against wealth and power as well as against themselves.” (Sklar 105)

Mack Sennett, Keystone (Keystone Kops)  — vulgar and violent; Chaplin and Keaton both more graceful, reliant on nuances (only flowered once they left Keystone)

Charlie Chaplin — development of the Tramp as his comic persona; elements of comedy:  masquerade, misinterpretation, fantasy — but not without social realism

development of bourgeois comedy (sex as central material, always aimed at preservation of social order; satire on “upward mobility”) — see Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton

Few silent comedians made transition to talkies

CHAPTER 8:  MOVIE-MADE CHILDREN

culture as marketplace of intangible commodities; reassertion of power by the guardians of tradition

desire of patricians to regulate flow of information to lower classes clashes with American cultural myths of mobility and success

struggle over movies as aspect of class struggle:  “just as inspectors entered stockyards and certified meat as fit for consumption, they should also inspect movies before people were allowed to consume them, so that any idea or image harmful to the moral, social or political health of the state could be suppressed.” (Sklar 124)

under guise of “protecting the young”; movies to blame for delinquency; attempts to establish federal censorship

Hugo Münsterberg:  psychological effects of moviegoing

alien threat:  foreigners holding “sway over the national soul” (Sklar 126)

Chicago censorship ordinance of 1907 — patronizing concern for lower classes

1915: U.S. Supreme Court upholds censorship of movies; decision stood for four decades

hearings before Chicago Motion Picture Commission; “threat” by William Brady that movies will now enter politics — hiring of Will Hays as motion picture czar as political act?

Hays promoting self-regulation; reformers see as sham

Motion Picture Research Council, “Payne Fund studies” — scholarly investigation of motion pictures and youth:  “The motion pictures stood accused: they could be found innocent or guilty of the charges against them, but it was clear that the scholarly investigators were working for the prosection.” (Sklar 135)

sex & the young & movies

“From a later perspective it may seem absurd that virtually the entire body of writing on motion-picture influence during this period assumes that movies were tearing down American culture rather than representing and reinforcing it.” (Sklar 139)

CHAPTER 9:  THE HOUSE THAT ADOLPH ZUKOR BUILT

power of Hollywood appears to be in movie moguls, but quite ephemeral, shifting

finance:  entry of outside capital produces conflict of economic issues

vacuum of power after dissolve of Trust; first grasp for power from distributors — intend to act as commodities brokers; to fulfill commitments for pictures, will underwrite production; establish production units of their own

Harry Aitken, Mutual Film Corp.; William Hodkinson, Paramount Pictures Corp.

Hodkinson contracts with Zukor to distribute all Famous Players films; didn’t foresee Zukor being unhappy with subcontractor role; Zukor buys out P’mount partners and takes over

Zukor, 1916, forms Famous-Lasky

transformation of film-rental system: “classes” of theaters (first-run, second-run); Zukor takes advantage by developing “block-booking”

countered by move for power by exhibitors:  First National Exhibitors Circuit

Paramount’s dominance followed by more vertical integration:  Fox, Universal, Metro, Goldwyn

threat to independent producers; formation of United Artists (Chaplin, Fairbanks, Pickford, Griffith)

power of distributor in studio system built by Zukor

movie palaces — financial sinkholes?  The movie palace crisis:  “The problem was a very specific one, having to do with the expense of operating first-run theaters and with the quality of first-run films: the former was too high, the latter too low.” (Sklar 151)

picture palace crisis precipitates development of sound; major studios resistant; upstart Warner Bros. releases The Jazz Singer in Oct. 1927 and makes a killing

transition to talkies as revolution but also counter-revolution and coup

changes: in behavior of moviegoers with introduction of sound; introduction of 1st Hays Production Code (1930); changes in moviemaking technology (soundstages, soundless cameras and lights); issues of language and the European market

evidence of counter-revolution:  smoothness of transition; “the visual aesthetics of Hollywood movies, the way shots were taken and assembled into a whole, changed little if at all from silents to sound.” (Sklar 155)

stability might go unnoticed except that H’wood saw its first major aesthetic challenge in these years from the Soviets: power of Soviet montage (Eisenstein’s Potemkin; Pudovkin’s Mother)

powerful effect on American intellectuals:  emergence of Soviet aesthetic reveals capitalist goals in American filmmaking

aesthetic/economic/ideological imperatives for shift to sound film:  “to recapture the center stage by a technological counterrevolution that reformulated the elements of cinema expression and gave new vitality and validity to the familiar mode of capitalist commercial cinema.” (Sklar 156) — see Eisenstein’s treatment in Hollywood

necessity of alliances with businesses outside the industry:  AT&T, RCA

entrance of Wall Street investment bankers; sstock-market crash leads to coup by bankers

III.  MASS CULTURE IN THE AGE OF MOVIES

CHAPTER 10:  THE MOGULS AT BAY AND THE CENSORS’ TRIUMPH

Depression as good for moviemakers?  disarmed anti-movie forces

“golden age” — Hollywood becomes center of American culture; movie culture becomes dominant

movies still hurt by Depression; movie culture as inevitably affected by American economy and society

studios in financial disarray:  Paramount, Universal, RKO, Fox; new round of power struggles

control by  money men?  Morgans and Rockefellers in control?  “The ultimate issue is not who owns the movie companies but who manages them.” (Sklar 164)

bitter contests for power over studios:  Paramount, Fox in battle for Loew’s and MGM; Fox wins, but brings on anti-trust suit by Justice Dept.; bankruptcy; 1935 forms 20th Century-Fox

Fox’s downfall as first time the federal government seriously affected Hollywood

movie tycoons working against Fox in Washington (esp. Louis B. Mayer)

entry of Democrats into power actually reduces gov’t interference — at first

uprising by independent second-run theater owners

1938 anti-trust suit against all eight majors; consent decree, ended block booking and blind booking

New Deal, NIRA code; included regs to reduce star salaries (at insistence of studios)

formation of Screen Writers Guild and Screen Actors Guild

FDR overturns code regs about salaries; NIRA gives right to collective bargaining — IATSE strike

censorship:  Roman-Catholic Church-led Legion of Decency, threatens boycott of indecent movies

1934, Joseph Breen and the Production Code Administration; self-regulation at last accepted by censorship forces

1930 Production Code:  “The immediate occasion for a new code at the end of the 1920s had come from the censorship problems posed by talking pictures, but Quigley and Father Lord went beyond the moment to prepare a document that attempted to establish once and for all a standard for moral values in a popular mass medium.” (Sklar 173)

studios ignored 1930 code; Breen office founded for enforcement

necessity of sex & crime to draw and audience; “compensating moral value” — strict line between good and evil, emphasis on retribution

Production Code restricted industry but also played a role in producing the “golden age”

CHAPTER 11:  THE GOLDEN AGE OF TURBULENCE AND THE GOLDEN AGE OF ORDER

adversarial stance of moview toward American culture in early 1930s; profit later in supporting culture; political goals of New Deal in patriotism and “national values”

Thalberg, Selznick, Zanuck

H’wood energy put into promoting “American values”

2 separate “golden ages” in 1930s:  1.  1930-1934

use of sound:  noise for shock, shocking language, music and musicals

treatment of women in this period — see Cagney shoving grapefruit in Mae Clarke’s face

horror  movies (Universal as horror specialists)

gangster films:  chaos in gangster films reflecting chaos in society; films of social pathos

comedy as subversion:  Marx Brothers, Mae West; very physical, visual forms of comedy

Marx Brothers:  Duck Soup, political satire

Mae West:  She Done Him Wrong, revolution in sex roles

W.C. Fields:  “When everything, including one’s self, is a target for destructive wit, there’s no room left for alternative social visions.” (Sklar 187)

second “golden age”:  1935-1941

produced “screwball comedy,” new comic style from old trite formulas; “their iconoclasm was used, overtly at least, to support the status quo.” (Sklar 187) — celebrated marriage, class distinctions, and dominance of men over women — support for social order, glorification of the rich

de-sexing and de-violencing of movies

Thalberg, Selznick, Zanuck — shifted Hollywood’s style to “elevated, respectable pictures set in the past and usually drawn from the classics or current best sellers” (Sklar 191)

second generation of moviemakers more involved in traditional American culture; moviemaking revealed as cultural institution in A Star Is Born

newcomer Orson Welles & Citizen Kane reminds Hollywood how powerful it is in development of cultural myths

CHAPTER 12:  THE MAKING OF CULTURAL MYTHS:  WALT DISNEY AND FRANK CAPRA

in late 1930s: “Among academics and in literary circles, however, and in the principal newspapers and magazines, the moviemakers were regarded with considerably more respect, awe and even envy, as the possessors of the power to create the nation’s myths and dreams.” (Sklar 195)

connotations of “myth” = false; word chosen for political purposes (other forms of culture speak more truly)

Depression shook cultural certitudes, left need to revitalize cultural mythology

“it is almost impossible to recapture the sense of discovery, wonder and loss which writers like Fitzgerald felt when they observed the Hollywood dream machine.” (Sklar 196) — see E.W.

foundation of Hollywoodization:  “the foreboding that Hollywood moviemaking was too costly, too single-minded in its quest for profits and therefore too narrowly conceived, to permit deviation from familiar cultural norms.” (Sklar 196)

“No Hollywood filmmakers of the 1930s were more consistent or coherent in their efforts at cultural mythmaking than two men whose careers offer striking similarities — the producers of animated cartoons, Walt Disney, and the director of comedy and drama, Frank Capra.” (Sklar 197)

two won acclaim of all three audience segments:  popular, critics, peers

both popular and highbrow

“comic images of heroes case in a popular mold” (Sklar 198)

both closely attuned to shifts in public tastes/moods; changes in their films demonstrate changes in Hollywood from beginning of decade to end

Walt Disney

heir to Méliès and Chaplin — fantasy

early shorts show technicial crudity, but inventiveness; to say that the later films are “better” is to make an aesthetic and cultural judgement as well as a technical one — Levi-Strauss:  “Modern life is not a sophisticated version of a simple life; it is an altogether different life, based on a separate understanding of the world.” (Sklar 199)

early cartoons are magical — world is changeable, plastic; freeing, then frightening disorder

new world view in later cartoons:  moral tales, orderly world

raunchiness of early cartoons provoked ridiculous public response; macabre

early fantasy begins to give way to later morality via increased violence, increased use of sentimental formuls

conservative political agenda in Three Little Pigs or simply praise for modernization?

new morality:  success = following society’s rules

Frank Capra

similar reorientation:  from fantasies to idealizations

“Fantasy, as the word is used here, is meant to apply not only to supernatural illusions . . . but to formula constructions in popular entertainment, a way of depicting the issues and conflicts of human relations so that everything comes out all right in the end” (Sklar 206)

in shift, heroes become more folksy; changes in presentation of the rich; “the people” now really behind the hero — Populism? misnomer:  didn’t want change in system, just change in people on top (Capra late films myths about false and true leaders

links between Capra hero and Christianity; myth of American hero transformed into defense of Christian morality

fascism v. Americanism; Capra head of wartime film propaganda

Disney also making wartime propaganda films

CHAPTER 13:  SELLING MOVIES OVERSEAS

attraction of American movies to international audiences:  depictions of American values and styles

dominance of American movies and ideals between wars; WW1 devastated European film industry

international admissions as pure profit

universality of film; movies in lead of efforts to expand all overseas trade — America’s imperialist desires led by movies

movies provoking international taste for American goods — led to federal support for film imperialism

Americanization of world film industries; attempts for foster domestic production (such as quota systems in Germany, Great Britain, France) led to American financial interest/ownership of  European production entities

effects of sound on American film hegemony:  fears all would want their own languages — Hollywood moves into foreign language film production; ended by Depression

dubbing, subtitles, some films left with American soundtracks — still dominant

international film censorship:  first just for moral interests, then political

international critics and moralists:  Hollywood as threat to European supremacy (also white sup.)

racism & paranoia — movies did have influence, demystifying white people

rebellion of young:  American youth fascination with black culture paralleled by worldwide youth fascination with American culture

the happy ending

CHAPTER 14:  THE HOLLYWOOD GOLD RUSH

H’wood as gold-rush boom town:  air of impermanence; gambling, gold-digging spirit

moviemaking as gamble requiring talent and luck

class divisions in H’wood — competition — spilled over into gambling

struggle to involve Hollywood in world events

star culture:  personality/image — star personality as last bit of gambling spirit

growth in management; manipulation of personality — studio contract system

rise of the agent

movie gossip & power:  Louella Parsons (later, Hedda Hopper)

screen writers — difficulties in writing (individual) for film (collective)

battle between producers and directors for control of filmmaking process

the Hollywood novel

Hollywood on political and social issues, frequently left — H’wood in politics nothing new (Hays)

HUAC:  1941 hearings — industry stood firm; committee distracted by war, but would return

IV.  THE DECLINE OF MOVIE CULTURE
CHAPTER 15:  HOLLYWOOD AT WAR FOR AMERICA AND AT WAR WITH ITSELF

1947 HUAC hearings as beginning of fall of film culture — H’wood began to destroy itself

wartime popularity of movies

movie style and content influenced by complex factors in larger culture, all of which together produced “overwhelming aura of claustrophobia” (Sklar 253) in WWII movies — film noir

film noir:  psychological thrillers; Hitchcock’s fascination with guilt and ambiguous play with identities — sense of people trapped, paranoia and fear

reveal crisis of faith; shift of horror from outside to inside

“In proclaiming their power to mold minds, Hollywood’s advocates inadvertently invited redoubled vigilance from the watchdogs who could tolerate claustrophobia and unrelieved blackness, but not one ray of informing light with which they could not disagree.” (Sklar 256) — return of HUAC

communist purge not specific to H’wood — nationwide

1947 investigation:  splits become visible in Hollywood; insiders now willing to testify against others

premise for blacklists:  “every Communist party member was an agent of a foreign ideology seeking to overthrow the American form of government and substitute its own, and that any such person employed in the entertainment and information media would undoubtedly use his or her position to attack American principles and put forward Communist ideals.” (Sklar 260)

friendlies:  some testified to minimize damage to industry?

the Hollywood Ten

second round of hearings, 1951 — blacklist; producers willing to sacrifice “a few” to save the industry

nature of anti-Communist times in America; producers willing to capitulate to any and all demands; turned on fellow-travelers

“the damage to Hollywood was very nearly fatal. . . . It had always stood slightly aslant the mainstream of American cultural values and expressions, seeking to hold its working-class audience while making movies attractive to middle-class tastes, and therefore never quite in step with other forms of cultural communication.  Movies were always less courageous than some organs of information and entertainment, but they were more iconoclastic than most . . . It was this trait that gave movies their popularity and their mythmaking power.
     And it was this trait that the anti-Communist crusade destroyed.” (Sklar 267)

“Let it not be said that television killed the movie industry: the movie industry must take that responsibility itself.” (Sklar 268)

CHAPTER 16:  THE DISAPPEARING AUDIENCE AND THE TELEVISION CRISIS

beginnings of audience/market research — produces optimism; but radio and TV . . .

film industry fails to respond appropriately to its new more accurate audience profile; stubborn misconception of audience:  intellectuals as enemies and “the people” as friends; ended up alienating their real audience

renewed anti-trust suit; consent decree of 1940 invalidated — 1949:  breakup of vertical integration

decline in overseas profits leads to overseas production

anxiety over TV; 3 possible courses of action:

1.  ownership of TV stations by studios:  attempted by Paramount and Zukor; almost owned 49% of CBS — but bankruptcy

2.  pay-TV:  only developed 4 decades later

3.  large-screen theater TV

TV and ad $ — product placement in movies?

Hollywood’s explanation for declining audience:  decline in movie quality

unintentional surrealism of post-war  movies; artificiality played up in comparison with Italian neo-realism; Hollywood as triumph of formula

trouble with continuity seen in use of voiceover narration — voice as distancing device? — see Sunset Boulevard; about past golden age of movies

end of “B” movie; allure of genre film:  revival of musical comedy, western

movie novelties:  3-D, Cinerama, enlarged screen image

CHAPTER 17:  HOLLYWOOD’S COLLAPSE

Hollywood’s troubles remain hidden; keeping up appearances, self-protection

the banks; agents and agencies; the unions

aging studio heads being pushed out, followed by more power shifts and acquisitions

studios remain important as distributors

“art”:  “the word ‘art’ was fraught with meanings that could not be accommodated with Hollywood’s reality: the factory system of production, mass audiences, enormous profits, producer domination of movie workers, collaborative creation — or with a lingering skepticism about the ability of Americans to produce art.” (Sklar 292)

European film, British film, Japanese film; foreign-language Oscars

art houses:  “The result was that the art-house audience which developed in the 1950s was convinced that only Europeans understood the cinema as an art.” (Sklar 294)

return to shock and titillation; beginning of the end of the Breen Office:  revealed purpose of code as imposition of theological standard

Jack Valenti, new pres. MPPA — junks code for ratings system (1968?)

death of art houses, rise of X theater

crossover hard core:  The Devil in Miss Jones and Deep Throat

rise of film in intellectual/academic circles; among baby-boomers

CHAPTER 18:  THE PROMISE OF PERSONAL FILM

personal cinema — movies as art

personal expression v. public theorizing

New American Cinema — underground film

new ways of seeing

romantic individualism

from trance films to mythopoeic films

structural film; graphic film/expanded cinema

movies as challenging cultural values and providing alternative viewpoints

“My own view is that there is nothing disreputable about creating stories for the entertainment, edification and uplifting of mass audiences.  That so many American movies have been mediocre or venal or false has to do with the profit motive that dominates them” (Sklar 316)

V.  THE ENDURING MEDIUM
CHAPTER 19:  NADIR AND REVIVAL

Hollywood’s revival in the 1970s; “golden age”/renaissance

cinematic innovation and critical approach to national institutions, iconoclasm

“a crisis of personnel”

directorial prestige — auteur theory

revolution in film distribution:  speed of distribution as high priority

the birth of merchandising

potential for directorial autonomy; auteurs v. box-office leaders

“film generation”

Roger Corman’s influence; first group of film-school grads:  Coppola, Lucas, Scorsese

nostalgia in audience response to genre films:  “the desire to return in thought to former times, as an exercise in regret for the loss of a presumed simplicity that did not yet know its future” (Sklar 328)

Lucas:  American Graffiti; Star Wars

genre, special fx, nostalgia; but what of social struggle?

issues of race and gender:  movies only changed within limits of codes and conventions

race:  Melvin Van Peebles, Sweet Sweetback; Shaft = movement into commercial mainstream; blaxploitation films; black mainstream filmmakers?  Sidney Poitier, Richard Pryor

gender:  chick pics, but no women filmmakers (except Elaine May); feminist film theory — Laura Mulvey — camera as male gaze turned on passive female object; women in documentary filmmaking

Vietnam:  absence of mainstream representation of the war; antiwar sentiments chanelled into docus

The Deer Hunter — Vietnam as metaphor; Apocalypse Now

By late 1970s, disenchantment with directors’ cinema; motto for 80s:  Better safe than sorry

CHAPTER 20:  HOLLYWOOD AND THE AGE OF REAGAN

the age of Reagan = the age of politics in Hollywood or the age of Hollywood in politics?

shaped not solely by ideology but also by technology — initial industry resistance to tech. innovations such as VCRs, cable, CD-ROM
