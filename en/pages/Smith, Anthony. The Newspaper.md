Smith, Anthony.  The Newspaper: An International History.  London: Thames and Hudson, 1979.


1. ORIGINS AND DEFINITIONS

“At the start the newspaper situated itself somewhere between the historian on one side and the diplomatic, financial and military courier on the other.  In the information which it chose to supply, and in the many sources of information which it took over and reorganized, it contained a bias towards recency or newness” (Smith 7)

term “newspaper” much newer than concept; evolved in fits and starts — earlier terms derived from methods by which news was collected or produced, or from kind of information provided (for instance, “advertisers,” “currents,” etc.)

“journal” = periodical with extracts from books as well as scientific/artistic articles; “gazette” = relation of public affairs

from first development of printing in late 15th c., appeared printed narratives of single news events; official proclamations; polemical leaflets, etc.; also beginnings of almanacs (not separate)

“The crucial distinction between such publications and the phenomenon of the newspaper is that in the latter a continuing relationship is set up between reader, printer and the originator of the information.” (Smith 9)

4 distinct stages of news publishing before it became as frequent and regular as we expect: (1) single-story publications, or “relations”; (2) continuous series of relations published as “coranto” (which did not conceive of itself as an entity, but rather separate publications); (3) “diurnall,” providing weekly accounts of occurrences of successive days; (4) “mercury,” series of books by single journalists, and “intelligencers,” a more official version

development of technical and administrative framework of newspaper in seventeenth century; in eighteenth century, development of newspaper “in its complete form” (Smith 12), with daily publication and miscellaneous content

newspaper began “not within a small local compass but as an instrument for describing events across immense geographical areas.” (Smith 13)

Eastern newspaper development: technology developed long before newspaper appeared in Europe, and handwritten publications appeared very early, but “the public, printed and periodical distribution of news did not begin until European traders and missionaries started foreign-language newspapers on the Chinese mainland, for their own purposes, in the nineteenth century” (Smith 14)

in Japan, seventeenth century development of the scandal sheet

“The evolution of the press in the Far East, therefore, though it seems at first sight to be an exception, actually bears out a general rule: the newspaper developed interconnectedly throughout the world, as a form dependent on printing which emerged from the economic and political conditions of Europe and spread only in so far as those conditions spread to other societies.” (Smith 15)

lines of communication, both in and out of newspaper suddenly jelled in seventeenth century

2. ‘THE OCCURRENCES ALL TOGETHER’: 1600–1696

basic network of postal routes, printing capacity, and local distribution established in many parts of Europe at the beginning of the seventeenth century

“In the seventeenth century, changes had taken place in the civil organization of European society, in its transport and communications, in the printing industry, in the structure and conduct of its diplomatic and administrative affairs, which made periodic publication of news viable.  Behind those changes lay other long-term shifts, in family structure, in patterns of population, in consciousness of citizenship, which rendered the supplying of news valuable and desirable.” (Smith 17)

gradual split of postal and news systems as governments took over postal services (Thurn und Taxis in charge of Austrian royal mail system — see Pynchon)

printing press as “mildly improved” version of Gutenberg press; labor-intensive; newspapers often slapdash affairs aimed at cash flow

censorship; control of printers by state and church; changes taking place: division of labor; no copyright

transition from sporadic to regular publication rapid

Dutch and Germans most prolific; French most “professional” — Theophraste Renaudot brought together a series of ideas involving the combination of news and advertising, creating “Bureau d’Adresses” as classified as clearinghouse; added news

effects of civil war in France and England on the press: “The street journalism of the [English] Civil War was the real forerunner of popular journalism.” (Smith 34)

traumas of Civil War journalism shaped personality: “The printers, writers and licensers associated with the medium of news were obliged to work out the implications of a professional ideology in which truthfulness, impartiality, loyalty to causes and service to the reader had to be balanced with the need to make profits and to joust constantly with authority.” (Smith 36)

partisan papers: Mercurius Aulicus (pro-King; pub. by Sir John Berkenhead); Mercurius Politicus (pro-Cromwell; pub. by. Marchamont Nedham); Mercurius Publicus (Restoration; Henry Muddiman)

Restoration as bleak period for English journalism; very tight media control — but new professionalism emerged in the collection and arrangement of accurate news; Sir Roger L’Estrange made surveyor of the press; Muddiman: London Gazette

development of the coffee-house, principal means by which newspapers were distributed

L’Estrange’s Observator as the first example of a new Tory journalism

demise of crown control of press; end of licensing system by 1695

3. ‘SERIOUS, SARCASTIC, LUDICROUS OR OTHERWISE AMUSING’: 1695-1776

rest of Europe watching England’s unlicensed press with horror and envy

press growing in London was wholly unreliable in info (much factionalism)

European sovereigns held absolute control over their newspaper industries — see Paris, “where political and intellectual information was being raised to a very high level of perfection, with no concession to the idea of liberty of publication” (Smith 47)

France: great diversity of forms; great organization — public reading places for illiterate, colporteurs (hawkers) required to be literate and registered

3 officially printed periodicals: Gazette de France (twice weekly, Renaudot), reproduction of official documents and foreign and provincial political news; Journal des Scavants (monthly), scientific info., university news, news of foreign arts; Mercure de France (monthly), social and literary news plus odes and sermons, later with political supplement

nomenclature: “gazette” = political news, multiple sources; “journal” = specific zone of social info

form known as “journal” gradually became standard daily publication (term triumphed over “gazette” and “mercure” to become the French word for newspaper)

1st sustained French daily paper 1777; in England, 1st daily paper established 1702 (Daily Courant); by mid-century, 5 London dailies

periodic talk of returning to a licensing system (or similar state control), but generally felt that differences of published opinion were not a threat to constitutional authority; plus, press could be controlled by manipulation

in 1st decade of 18th c., development of specialized papers

by mid-century, a shift in pattern of publication: a few important newspapers and journals began to dominate, and all began to incorporate a wider variety of material

distribution in London: networks of hawkers which became highly organized business — but distributors often held responsible for offenses of papers they sold

coffee-houses formed into loose federation

special taxes attempting to control press

printers also held responsible for content of papers; however: “Despite the institutional harassment of the press, newspapers and journalism were steadily gaining acceptance as indispensible parts of the constitutional life of society.” (Smith 61)

new forms of newspaper ownership after 1730s: group ownership, primarily by booksellers

Act of 1710 created 28-year copyright system

advertising becomes important source of revenue

development of the political essay as defining content of weekly journal; brought writers such as Fielding, Defoe, Swift to news publication; established journalsim as form of political power

appetite for news growing; increased sensationalism of news content

Parliament closed to press; series of struggles on part of mature 18th c. press against harassment, against privilege of judges to make libel assessments, and against prohibition of reporting on P.

censorship throughout Europe strong as a result of the “chaos” of the English press (esp. Austria)

newspaper industry development in American colonies: Boston as birthplace of American press

printing press — imported in parts from England until 1769 — represented the “technology of independence” — linked colonies; cause of press freedom as founding principle of U.S.

America’s 1st newspaper: single issue failure (1689, 1690)

Ben Franklin imported the Spectator-type weekly essay

libel trial of John Peter Zenger (1735): 1st voice of libertarian truculence in Am. journalism

range of journalistic voices leading to War for Independence:  Tory (James Rivington), home rule (John Dickinson) — but most radical style, that of Isaiah Thomas and Samuel Adams, caught mood of colonists and stirred up spirit of rebellion

Thomas Paine as journalistic agitator-advocate of freedom

demand for freedom of press likewise sweeping across Europe, to reach crisis in French Revolution

“After the era of the great journalist-essayists — Addison, Swift, Richard Steele — journalism steadily sank in social esteem” (Smith 76); rep. of journalism took a long time to recover

4. ‘TOCSIN OF NATIONS’: 1776-1815

“When the colony of Virginia proposed the Declaration of Independence in 1776, no country in the world gave its citizens the right of free publication.” (Smith 79)

many states achieved preedoms when new libertarian regimes took over in the age of revolution, only to lose them in counter-revolutions

but transformation during this period — newspapers became valuable enterprises; technical revolutions

relationship between press and events of revolutionary era gave press new image in eyes of gov’t

“In America, the linkages of a new society without the class structures of Europe were being partly created by this rising medium of imformation.” (Smith 80)

new printing press technology

importance of press in early days of U.S. — still hard for colonies to think of themselves as a unit — press explained and lobbied for Constitution and Bill of Rights

breaking out of dissension between Federalists (Hamilton) and Republicans (Jefferson) gave newspapers new function — drawing the lines of party warfare

factional papers: Gazette of the U.S. and New York Evening Post (Federalist); Independent Gazette and National Gazette (Republican)

1798: Alien and Sedition Acts passed by Federalists stinging from attacks; 7 anti-Federalist editors convicted and jailed — but within two years, caused reversal and backlash: Jefferson elected

still took time for U.S. to get full range of journalistic freedoms

new party conflict brought about new journalistic professionalism, separation of editor from printer

in Europe, the cause of press freedom began to become a popular cause, with support in working class

“The newspaper was the medium by which the revolutionary experience spread in the period following American independence.” (Smith 87)

press liberty lasted three years in France, the journalists became early victims of the Terror, including Jean-Paul Marat — by Sept. 1797, press under police control; by Nov. (Napoleon’s coup), French press liberty destroyed

Napoleon also “virtually extinguished journalism in a large number of conquered, client, and simply frightened countries” (Smith 91)

development of English press:  Friedrich Koenig’s new printing press, with steam engine; much expansion; much agitation

French Revolution magnified the cause of liberty into a struggle separated from the middle class

most of working class papers were unstamped, illegal, but procided good service; repeated arguments for new radical causes in didactic style

“The eighteenth-century newspaper had been synonomous with political bribery and journalistic scurrility” (Smith 97), but important advances were made in late 18th c. in techniques of journalism and newspaper production:  new system of reporting debates (relay of note-takers); rise in general social level of journalists

The Times — John Walter II succeeded his father in 1803; one great innovation in relationship between newspapers and readers: “its leadership of a clearly delineated demographic block” (Smith 102)

“The newspaper during the era of revolution had ceased to be the simple handmaiden of parliamentary faction and taken on the more mature role of independent actor in the political world.” (Smith 102)

5. ‘LA PRESSE EST LIBRE...’: 1815-1880

by 1881, press freedom was an enduring institution; by 1880s, newspapers “had been brought inside the industrial framework; the editor had become the linchpin of all party political activity; and the readers had been drawn into the vastly expanded rold of the newspaper, which aroused them to political action, helped them in their businesses, taught them the arts of urban life or just entertained them” (Smith 105)

mechanical and organizational basis being laid for popular newspaper of 20th c.

developments outside politics which affected (American) newspaper development:  millions of new consumers in manufacturing economy; 3 million American primary schoolchildren; multiplying post offices and allowance of pre-paid postage on papers; property restrictions on right to vote dropped; most important: invention of kerosene lamp (1830); growth of cities

new paper-making process, 1820, dropped price of paper by 25%

advances in printing: Koenig press, 1820; New Press (Applegath and Cowper), 1827, four times faster; in U.S., Hoe’s revolving press, 1840, five times faster still

still lacking real advances in typesetting until Linotype invented by Ottmar Mergenthaler in 1892

by 1890, wide choice of printing machinery w/ specialized technology for diff types of papers

search for an appropriate means of newspaper industry regulation; trials and tribulations in France

ultimate liberalizing of press legislation in France made it possible for a mass press to appear in France earlier than in any other European country

newspaper as carrier of insurrection throughout Europe

anonymity of the editor; income from advertising

elimination of the stamp tax; penny press arose afterward

adverturistic journalism arising; William Howard Russell’s war correspondence

growth in the provincial press:  the telegraph ends the London papers’ monopoly; 1868, provincial papers form the Press Association to provide them with the same news as the London papers

other wire organizations:  Reuter’s; Havas (Paris)

changes made in business of reporting by the introduction of the telegraph

rise of the Sunday paper

C.P. Scott, ed. Manchester Guardian, rigid separation of fact from comment; stood for values rather than a party interest, “a distinction which was to be an essential element in the gradual redefinition of the role of the newspaper in the approaching twentieth century” (Smith 130)

development of press throughout British empire follows that of England

U.S.:  commerce rather than politics as most stable foundation for newspaper

Andrew Jackson as “the first president to elevate the press to an actual means by which government was conducted” (Smith 135); only in 1860, with the establishment of the Government Printing Office (which meant the end to printing contracts), was party press extinguished

New York penny press: the Sun; the Herald (James Gordon Bennett)

the New York Tribune — Horace Greeley, “journalistic messiah”

“By 1850 the New York newspaper was the repository of a large quantity of solid capital, and the time was ripe for the advent of journalism as a major business.” (Smith 139); New York Times, 1851

revolution in the newsroom: news clipping services, telegraphs, news wires (Associated Press, 1848)

owner-editors being forced more and more into management and out of day-to-day control

arrival of advertising agencies in the 1840s

in the 1880s, newspapers everywhere ready for a new formula

6. ‘THE DEMON OF SENSATIONALISM’: 1880-1980

1880s and 1890s as golden age of journalism: “Public opinion appeared to have become the primary force by which modern society moved, and its miraculous dynamism was the end-product of the newspaper.” (Smith 143) — but golden ages pass

English newspaper as big business (no longer appendage of printing industry); many industries dependent upon the newspaper

“Newspapers had always, as we have seen, drawn a large proportion of their revenue from advertising; what happened in the twentieth century was that newspapers came to look upon their potential readers as segments of consumerdom. . . . Where it saw itself in its heyday as a medium competing for the attention of voting groups and interest groups, it has now come to concentrate on making itself indispensable to consumers of goods.” (Smith 147)

total spent on advertising in US:  1880, $40 million; 1904, $140 million; newspaper’s percentage of total declined with rise of other media, but maintained near-monopoly on classified ads

decline in importance of political line of newspaper

technological developments:  20th century added only speed and quantity, until the development of offset printing and photo-composition in the 1970s

color printing; rotogravure illustration; electricity (after 1900); teletype

1924, first pictures transmitted over wires; decade later, AP operates first Wirephoto service

development of the half-tone, 1880; by end of century, photography as new subdivision of journalism

telephone produced division of labor in reporting: “legmen” and “rewrite men”

photo-composition and offset printing became widely viable in 1970s; replacement of hot metal with cold type

introduction of computers into writing, editing, composition process; “In the late twentieth century the newspaper has ceased in most countries to be a Victorian mechanical industry and has become a silent electronic industry” (Smith 151)

“The newspaper has become the subject of a new industrial revolution, one which has brought it — by a technical paradox — much closer in the manner of its production to its electronic rivals, radio and television.” (Smith 152) — print media and also irretrievably electronic!

W.T. Stead, pioneer of “new journalism”; took over the Pall Mall Gazette in 1881; developed visually arresting front page: heavy headlines, etc.; The Times finally converts to Americanized headline in 1887

mass journalism begun with approach of evening papers

English newspaper enterprises moving into joint stock companies

“In the decision to make government responsible for mass literacy, a gigantic market had been guaranteed; the question was not whether the resulting hunger for printed material should be satisfied, but how it should be satisfied, with ‘sweetness and light,’ as Arnold demanded, echoing Bunyan, or with ‘anarchy.’” (Smith 157)

tone in American journalism of “non-partisan crusading cynicism” (Smith 157)

the circulation-boosting “stunt”: deliberate creation of an item of sensational news (see TV)

the “yellow press”: sensationalism

struggles of city papers to be “first” with the news

“The stunt and the crusade replaced the great liberal causes as the intellectual quest of journalism” (Smith 159)

Joseph Pulitzer, New York World — skillful use of banner headline; offered public “ringside seat at a great display” (Smith 160)

Mary Baker Eddy, Christian Science Monitor, 1908 — protest against the practices of the mass press

death of the “opinon” press, personal journalism

beginning of the syndicated column: Walter Lippman, Alsop brothers, Walter Winchell

new forms in era of mass press: comic strip

ideological papers kept alive in England

political indignation that mass press was not as “buyable” as predecessors had been

shrinking number of owners in control of large segments of readership; fears of monopoly

means of restricting pluralism: formation of syndicates; new American copyright laws (1870 and 1874); chain ownership of newspapers

development of UPI from news service of Edward Scripps-owned “League” of papers

William Randolph Hearst: 31 papers, 6 magazines, film interests and two wire services

takeover of chains in 1970s

changes in marketing patterns made 1960s era of consolidation: main morning paper in most cities owned main evening paper

“Fears grew that radio and television, which were now the main interlopers in the newspapers’ monopoly of news in medium-sized and small towns, were gradually slipping into the hands of the same companies which controlled local papers.” (Smith 165) — see Manships

gulf between American and European journalistic practice, the former dedicated to a “neutral, factual” journalism, the latter believing that journalists should keep ideological affiliations in the open

journalists as important political instrument in America — exposure of scandals, Teapot Dome to Watergate

“The First Amendment to the American Constitution, which guaranteed the freedom of the press, became the basis of a constitutionally guaranteed flow of information from bureaucracy to public; it also became the means by which publishers and broadcasting entrepreneurs could run their newspapers and stations in whatever way brought most profit.” (Smith 168)

presidential press conferences begun with Wilson; FDR added radio; Kennedy (?) added TV

“politics of the image” (Smith 169) — counter-activity to journalism: professional supplying of news; political parties set up “press bureaus”; public relations as alter ego of journalism — “another complete industry founded on the assumption that information could itself be ‘managed’” (Smith 170)

revolutionary/nationalistic press in Africa, Asia, and South America

Japan as “one of the few non-Anglo-Saxon countries whose press is powerful enough to have any impact outside its own borders” (Smith 170)

presses in other countries which were victims of invasion and occupation

“In every country in Europe the most pressing phenomenon in the newspaper business since 1950 has been the steady loss of titles.” (Smith 180) — many countries developed subsidies

“In the course of four hundred years the newspaper press has not finally dealt with the issues into which it was born.  Its methods of production and distribution are always inadequate to the ideals and purposes which appear to rise from the activity of collecting news.” (Smith 182-83)

newspapers ceasing to be mechanical/manufacturing concerns; becoming electronic
