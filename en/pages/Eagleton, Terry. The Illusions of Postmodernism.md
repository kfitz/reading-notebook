Eagleton, Terry.  The Illusions of Postmodernism.  Oxford, UK:  Blackwell Publishers, 1997.


Preface

socialist critique of postmodernism?  claims to be more interested in the ideas than in the cultural artifacts -- and says he's against it.  But against what?  Against the theorists who attempt to sort out the ideas, or against the ideas themselves, as they play out in lived "reality"?

"It would be intellectual dishonesty to pretend that Marxism is any longer a living political reality.... It is just that it would be a good deal worse that dishonest in such circumstances to relinquish the vision of a just society, and so to acquiesce in the appalling mess which is the contemporary world" (Eagleton ix) -- whom is he accusing of having done this?


1.  Beginnings

reactions of left intellectuals to left's demise:  "The radical impulse would not be abandoned; but it would shift gradually from the transformative to the subversive, and nobody except the advertisers would speak of revolution anymore" (Eagleton 4)


2.  Ambivalences

(apparently never finished)
