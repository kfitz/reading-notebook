White, Curtis.  Memories of My Father Watching TV.  Normal, IL:  Dalkey Archive Press, 1998.


memories of his father watching TV are in part about his father "ignoring the chaos around him" (White 3), TV as a kind of escape from the realities of family life.  But at the same time, TV /is/ the reality of family life:  what is this family, other than clustered around the TV?

the TV, after all, is "an oracle.  It is speaking to us.  It has something very important to say" (White 4); to turn away from the TV is to miss out on a glimpse of the dark heart of the U.S. family

Gloom

TV Scandal

first series - Quiz Show; father's implication in scandals

"obviously my father might object, but, unhappily, his attention has not been distracted from our television set since the early 1960s, so it's difficult to know exactly what he might think" (White 9-10)

"In the 1950s, in the years following the famous McCarthy investigations (which a spellbound America watched unravel in their very own living rooms during the live broadcasts of the Army-McCarthy hearings), my father was thrown, like the rest of America, into a contradictory and futile effort to be something other than insidious" (White 10)

game shows born out of a "national need for someone to be smart" (White 10)

but rigging of shows reveals that "the apparently good-hearted effort of television to display and applaud the intelligence of America's ordinary people turned into just the opposite" (White 11)

Nixon & Khrushchev's "kitchen debate":  "Nixon hoped to create an event for a watchful television world.  As with his Checkers speech, he was conscious of the need for an artful reality" (White 18)

"They were being taped, so they would immediately be able to see a replay of their live performance.  This was the high-water mark in the history of international diplomatic narcissism" (White 19)

"Nixon did not know how to respond.  He wanted desperately to talk about appliances.  That is what he was prepared to do.  He was also utterly aware of being trapped on videotape.  The video camera reported everything just as it happened" (White 19)

dad watches kitchen debate, which "was the basis for Nixon's lifelong claim of 'standing up' to the Russians" (White 21), and is unimpressed; begins sending challenges to the Soviet UN delegation

"As I've mentioned, my father has been in a cataleptic trance before the TV since November of 1963.  I think there was something hypnotic in the Kennedy funeral procession." (White 21)

dad meets with Khrushchev (or at least his animatronic head) at Tomorrowland, a scene in which there's some strange implication that the animatronic head is his dad's father?

Khrushchev:  "So, let us gather where the TV broke down.  Shards of our family assemble there" (White 28)

"On the evening Dad told of this last scene, in the dead winter of summer reruns 1972, his dozing eyes were swollen with tears" (White 28)

"Dad grew suddenly clearer, more daylit and awake, his telling self now done.  He looked to the TV set.  It was near midnight and public service broadcasting was on.  Was on.  Was on.  He looked back at me suspiciously.  'What's this garbage?  Have you changed the channel?  I was watching my program.  Don't ever change my program, Son.  Now go to bed.  This show's way too grown up for you.'" (White 28)

Highway Patrol

"Watching /Highway Patrol/ now is as strange as seeing real footage of dinosaurs plodding and plundering through the Mesozoic" (White 30).

"Make no mistake, to watch /Highway Patrol/ at its 'regularly scheduled time' in 1957 was a stupefying waste (just as Newt Minnow's 'vast wasteland' imagined back in 1961); to watch /Highway Patrol/ in syndication on cable nostalgia channels in the 1990s is no less deadening (sorry, not a bit; /Mr. Ed/ gives you nothing of your life back).  It does seem to me true, however, that to watch /Highway Patrol/ in the monkish, climate-controlled confines of the Wisconsin Center for Film Research, in the greedy, self-indulgent dark, is to be presented with an opportunity for a meditation on Time worthy of Saint Augustine.  Broderick Crawford as Captain Dan Mathews rubs his jaw speculatively.  The moment passes.  Thirty-five years later I watch him rub his jaw speculatively.  The moment passes.  I am writing about Broderick Crawford rubbing his jaw.  The moment passes.  The moment of the moment passing passes." (White 30-31)

in this chapter, dad was a California Highway Patrol officer, killed in the line of duty; Dan Mathews attempts to fill in for the dead father

"Murderers take heed: the man you kill may be somebody's father.  Somewhere there is a little boy who needs to kill that father himself in order that he may grow up strong and true" (White 34) -- chapter is wrapped around Freudian psychoanalysis

Dan Mathews eventually kills the father's killer, but "my sisters and I find it difficult to take pleasure in this revenge, even though we own the episode on video and may watch it as often as we like.  Because nothing can bring our father back to us.  Unless of course Dan Mathews would be willing to be our father" (White 34)

Bonanza

opens with graphic representation of theme song

followed by graphic poem of burning map:
   "Miraculously riding out of the very center of this
             apocalypse are the Cartwrights.
       Little Joe, Ben and Hoss.  They're all smiles
      We'll need men like this after the apocalypse." (White 55)

episode is the story told by the "Wild Father"

"'I taped it off the Family Channel, Wild Father.  It plays reruns twice a day.  The Family Channel is owned by Christian corporate interests.  They believe that /Bonanza/, the saga of the admirable Cartwrights, fosters family values in America'" (White 56)

episode is filled with weird gender stuff

followed by a critical analysis, entitled "Women and Horses: The Secret Connection," written by "Dr. James Wildfather, University of Twigs at Gully" (White 61)

Combat

"1.  In the episode of /Combat/ titled "Command," my father was a German pontoon bridge built over a narrow French river" (White 68)

"Was my father's fervently held notion, conveyed regularly during wee-hour confessions to his amazed and sleepy children, that he was a pontoon bridge for the Nazis delusional?  Was Gregor Samsa's depressed ideation ('I am a monstrous vermin') delusional?  Or were these things metaphors?  Is metaphor a delusion?" (White 69)

"I confess to you that the deaths of those also-appearing-in-alphabetical-order affect me.  My depressed brain, in which my ill spirit sobs in each blood cell, tells me that this is something worthy of tears.  I weep for the lives of the soldiers who will not return in next week's episode" (White 71)

"17.  In the end, the thesis of the television program /Combat/ is that America won World War II because of baseball" (White 74)

"19.  My father would watch /Combat/ obsessively if for no other reason than that he had an idolatrous relationship with the sound of guns" (White 74)

"22.  From this lesson we conclude the following disturbing truths:
a) when authority is most brutal and indifferent, it is then that it loves and cares for us most;
b) when one fails to choose death, death will come anyway, later, multiplied;
c) ergo: always choose death.
-  Another way of understanding #22:  in order to win the war, Americans had to become the moral equivalent (as Field Marshal Reagan would say) of the Nazis" (White 75-76)

Sarge blows up bridge/father to stop Nazis:  "He couldn't understand, of course, but he had become my father.  My father's essence could not be destroyed; it had to reside somewhere.  It must have flowed back up the wires to the detonatory at the moment of his death.  Like me, Sergeant Saunders is now possessed by my father.  The undead.  They walk among us" (White 78)

Glee

Sea Hunt

living with mom at Nassau Trauma Center, as father had disappeared; mom thinks he's "under these waters" (White 86)

"My final question for my mother was this, 'Is the reason Dad treats his sadness by putting himself far away from us, underwater, because we made him sad? Is it our fault?'
Obviously, my mother was impressed by the seriousness of this question.  She looked at me sadly and, shaking her head slowly, said 'Not /we/, son, and not /our/.'
From which I drew the unavoidable conclusion, plummeting in my heart surely as my father plummeted in the sea: it was I who drove my father away.
He hated me." (White 88)

Lloyd Bridges's perversions

"This was all a goddamned joke.  My father wasn't in these waters.  In the name of God, how could my mother possibly believe that he remained under this awful water for months on end?
I don't know who told her this stupid thing, but she was a moron to believe it." (White 93)

but dad does appear from the sea at the end, apparently having saved the day in the episode (catching the canister of nitro), but chris thinks the nitro is a birthday present for him?

Have Gun - Will Travel

"The return of sexual appetite is a sign that depression has begun to lift" (White 100)

explication of episode, with each segment broken down by proairesis, figura,  and exegesis

much of this episode is about the relationship between having sex and watching TV; the /figura/ are all outside the televisual narrative, set in the 1980s, between a recently divorced man and his new girlfriend

after comment on Paladin's erudition:  "But what of my own intellectual performance here?  I am writing about a TV cowboy show but I use words like /proairesis/, /figura/, and /exegesis/?  As my mom would say, I am 'Mr. Smartypants.' A snob.
Is this not a way of demeaning popular culture and the entertainment it provides?  Do I not seek to demonstrate my own 'difference' and thus the distance at which I stand from ordinary people and their world?  More to the point, do I not distance myself from my father, who watched these programs?" (White 106)

on his spiel against the Vietnam war:  "My father was neither enlightened nor amused by my callow performance.  His response was, 'You talk like a damned computer.'  Which was a way of saying -- 'You are not human.'" (White 107)

"In short, in this world life is all death because no one recognized anyone else as human like themselves" (White 107)

"Unfortunately, this confirms the suspicion of incompetence we entertained when we saw that even Paladin's old friend Ernie was just Detective Frank Smith from /Dragnet/.  Or Major Potter from /M*A*S\*H/.  What in the workd was he doing in Texas in the 1890s?!  Were we really supposed to pretend we didn't recognize him?  'Oh, look, now I'm a cowboy!'" (White 108)

"Once she took him home to meet her parents.  He was surprised to see that, although she was of a slightly younger generation, her family too was all life-on-TV.  Even her father slept away his life, dreamless, in a recliner before the TV set" (White 108)

"(What does it mean that TV achieves its ultimate purpose when it is watched with eyes closed?)" (White 108)

conjunction of shooting on TV screen and feeling of being shot by girl's father while having sex with her

see the final exegesis, which seems to put the novel's relation of television and the dissolution of the family into place:  "The death of the Primitive at the hands of the Civil, touched by the tiny fatality of the derringer, is a deeply encrypted trope.  Taken literally, it implies the mean continuation of a culture of violence, alcoholism and inhuman isolation.  Taken figurally it means SEE WITHOUT TURNING AWAY.  DO NOT FORGIVE THE UNFORGIVABLE.  STAY ANGRY.  IT IS OUR ONLY HOPE" (White 114)

Manic Maverick

stream of consciousness, child's perspective, much scatology

"After dinner, the real action would begin... the TV... Poppy would watch 'his show'... 'my show is on,' he'd say... as if that made it special... the old meany... every hour of every evening was 'special' because 'his show' was on... this is not something people accept anymore... times have changed!... we're more democrativ... we don't put up with these tawdry patriarchs... but in his moment he had exclusive claim to watching /Combat/, /Bonanza/, /Highway Patrol/, /Sea Hunt/, /Have Gun - Will Travel/, and many more any time he pleased..." (White 116-17)

"There was only one night in two decades that was other than sepulchral... tenebrous... when things are tenebrous, you don't even want to know how dark they are... even the darkest human life has at least one moment of revelation in it... 'What's on TV tonight?' the boy asked... 'My show's on'... 'What is it?'... '/Maverick/.'" (White 118)

Maverick is blue! has become some kind of Vishnu-like god! episode becomes a kind of origin narrative! including incest between Maverick and his sister Lila!

"You can't imagine the effect this scene has on Poppy... I can't describe it... he looks blasted back against the sofa cushions... ideas are coming at him with the centrifugal force of a jet... thirty G's knock him silly... this is a guy who hasn't had a thought in years... the scales on his eyes have their own scales... the poor guy looks like the Upanishads have just been downloaded into his frontal lobe... he sees it all... worse yet, 'his show' is just getting started..." (White 120)

interruptions with commercials about parasites

"'Poppy, that show scared me.  What was it about?'
'It was scary to me, too, Butch.  And I don't know what it was about.  But remember, that's all just life-on-TV.  That's not real life'" (White 137)

chapter ends with son and father playing catch; vivid connection between the two; intense blue of sky becomes Maverick...

Saturday Night at the Movies

in prologue, Chris was flipping marshmellows into his mouth; this chapter begins with marshmellows raining down on his face

"Then God speaks.  God is the atmosphere in which marshmellows fling themselves toward the heavens.  And God is the moral climae in which one's face is patted.  But God is also capable of infusing the world with voice.
God can say: 'Butch, what in the hell are you doing?'
My father-who-art-on-the-couch, hallowed be thy Life-on-TV" (White 140)

dad gestures to son, asking him to sit with him on sofa

"Now this may all seem like just another evening in your average, damaged middle-class household.  Not so!  Remember, my father had not spoken to me since I was an infant.  This was like wanting to know who had killed your best friend and then being given the extraordinary opportunity to ask questions of the victim himself" (White 142)

asks dad if he's happy; asks him how he knows

"'I'm happy because I just am.  I have your mother and I have you kids and we have Poochie and the house and nice things like the TV.'
'Dad, why do you watch TV every night?'
'I like the TV, Son.  I enjoy it.  It's very entertaining.'
'You watch TV because it's entertaining.'
'That's right.'
'Oh.'
/(Pause)/
'Dad, why don't you talk to me or Winny or Janey?'
'I don't have anything to say to you.  It's nothing personal.  If I had something to say, I'd say it.'" (White 143)

goes on to ask dad why he drinks; dad says to "cut all this jabber" (White 144) and watch a movie - /The Third Man/

"'Well, I had many fine adventures and I'm gonna tell you every one of them.  But when Carol Reed and Orson Welles made this movie in Vienna back in 1948, they put me in it!'
'You're in this movie?'
'Bet your bottom dollar.'
'Who are you?'
'What makes you think I'm a who?'
'What else could you be?'
'Maybe I'm a building or a bridge.'" (White 144)

Dad turns out to have played fingers thrusting through a grill

"One way or another, that was that.  We'd had our mythic evening.  It was over with the startling and uncomfortable suddenness of emerging from the magic of a darkened theater into the afternoon sun or, worse yet, a suburban shopping mall.  We'd shared.  We'd talked.  I'd discovered things about my father.  But Anna's words kept returning to me: 'A person doesn't change because you find out more.'  Too bad" (White 155)

ends with what looks to be a happy family outing in the car, but mom's hair is on fire, and spreads to sisters






me to kiki:

I finished the book a few days ago -- home with the family over the holidays is an interesting time to read such a novel! -- and absolutely think that I'll focus on some conjunction of the representations of television in the novel and the ways that television is used as a representing device.  I need to do some more pondering before I can be more specific about what my argument might be, but I'm circling around the ways that television becomes a disruptive force in the home, breaking traditional familial bonds in favor of bonds with the machine.  There's something in this that's similar to the treatments of television in the novels that I've written about under the rubric of the anxiety of obsolescence -- mostly Pynchon and DeLillo -- in that television induces the adoption of machinic affiliations in place of human affiliations, and that this is considered a Bad Thing.  What's different here, however, is the way that the television here seems to foster new kinds of human relationships and imaginative work.  As opposed to Vineland, for instance, in which television figures the new fascism, or Americana, in which it evacuates reality of any referent in favor of a purely simulacral existence, Memories seems to suggest both through its appropriated, hallucinogenic televisual narratives and through its final projection of the bonding of father and son within those narratives, that television can produce new kinds of dreams that contain within them a sort of revolutionary possibility.  I'm not sure what that possibility might be yet -- this is all going to take more thought -- but the main deal is that I think the reviewers are being far too simplistic when they say that White's novel is an "antidote" for television (television as disease), or that the novel provides an alternative to the mind-numbing narratives of television (novel and television locked in some kind of media-ecological death match).  I think there's something more paradoxically Deleuzian at work in this novel, suggesting a more symbiotic relationship between human and machine and between novel and television than is immediately apparent.


kiki to me:

in particular, i think the "less hostile" approach to television (vs. condemnation as the destroyer of all things human) is productive and original. it does seem that white presents an alternative to the de-humanizing aspect that is attributed to t.v. in novels like *vineland
and *americana.
and the deleuzian machine-body construction is a smart way of providing a theoretical framework for this reading.

another advantage of your approach, in terms of this being a student-teacher geared collection, is that you may (at least in the first instance) sketch out the larger context of televisual representation in recent fiction (and the concepts of simluacra and market-capitalism that inform them) and locate white's text in relation to these.
